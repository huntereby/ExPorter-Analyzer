Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects > 20 million Americans. The prevalence of asthma has
been increasing since the early 1980s in all age, sex, and racial groups. There is no universal method for de-
termining asthma severity. The terminology and the definition used in various asthma guidelines have
evolved over time. Most commonly, asthma severity is determined by clinical parameters such as medica-
tion use, presence and/or frequency of asthma symptoms, number of asthma exacerbations (which are
acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tight-
ness or some combination of these symptoms), and/or the results of lung function tests. Patients with persis-
tent asthma are at elevated risk for exacerbations (attack) and often have decreased lung function. Yet the bur-
den of intermittent asthma is also significant: It affects 50-75% of all asthma patients and represents 30-40% of
total asthma exacerbations requiring emergency consultation. Risk factors for asthma exacerbations have
been studied in patients with persistent asthma. However, little is known about risk factors in patients with in-
termittent asthma, nor have risk prediction models been reported. A focused study on risk factor identification
and future risk prediction will provide valuable insights into the etiology of asthma exacerbations in intermittent
asthma patients and facilitate a personalized approach in the management of the disease. Without a clear un-
derstanding of the risk of asthma exacerbation for each individual patient with intermittent asthma, we will not
be able to optimally define the most appropriate intervention strategies to reduce the burden of the disease in
this group of patients. To operationalize the clinical definition of intermittent asthma, we will focus on a pheno-
typic group of low utilizers referred to in guidelines as intermittent asthma. We propose to identify potential risk
factors for asthma exacerbation in low utilizers using high-dimensional and longitudinal KPSC EHR and exter-
nal data sources (including air quality measures, social determinants of health and violent crime), subsequently
develop and validate risk prediction models to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups, and externally
validate the risk prediction model using EHR data of another large health care organization. We also propose
to establish a prospective cohort of low utilizers and collect patient-reported information (PRI) via a survey. The
PRI will help characterize the patients of low utilizers in terms of asthma symptoms, activities, impairment and
risk assessment, work productivity, beliefs about medicines and anxiety/depression scales. We will develop
and internally validate a risk prediction model based on both EHR and PRI data. The proposed models will al-
low physicians to provide personalized care (e.g., develop or adjust treatment plans, provide personal asthma
action plans accordingly, and refer patients to asthma specialists when necessary) and thus improve the qual-
ity of care and reduce asthma burden. Our proposal to examine heterogeneity across different racial/ethnic
groups has the potential to inform practice for more accurate asthma risk assessment."

Motivated behaviors such as feeding and reward-seeking are critical for an organism's survival. These
processes require distributed neuronal networks and supporting cell types in multiple brain regions to be tightly
regulated and tuned in order to orchestrate behavioral output. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) has long
been identified as a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motivated behavior. Despite decades of research,
the molecular identity of defined LHA cell types remains poorly understood. Additionally, while LHA neurons
have been previously shown to encode appetitive and consummatory behaviors via distinct cellular ensembles,
it remains unknown how distinct LHA output neurons contribute to these processes. Here we propose to
continue to study the neural circuits of the LHA, and to identify how distinct cell types contribute to feeding and
reinforcement. Using an interdisciplinary approach to leverage cutting edge tools such as single cell
transcriptional profiling, two photon calcium imaging, and viral we aim to undercover key circuit elements, and
novel circuit specific gene expression patterns that can be leveraged for future therapeutic interventions for
addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders."
10833466,"Over the past decade, studies of the immune microenvironment of cancer in both murine models and
humans has identified intracellular signaling pathways and expression of membrane ligands and receptors
that locally inhibit antitumor immune responses. Among the most important are the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2
that interact with the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 on activated immune cells. In the clinic, six unique PD-(L)1
blocking antibodies have had significant impact against a diverse range of advanced solid tumors, and have
so far been approved by the FDA for 17 different disease indications. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry
testing for PD-L1 expression in pretreatment tumor biopsies, correlated in our early studies with anti-PD-1
clinical response, has been translated into 4 different commercial tests currently approved in specific cancer
types to identify patients with an increased likelihood of treatment response.
 The current challenge, which will be addressed in this proposal, is to understand mechanisms underlying
anti-PD-(L)1 resistance in individual patients and across cancer types, affecting ~80% of patients receiving
these drugs. Why do many patients with PD-L1+ tumors NOT respond to PD-1 pathway blockers? Why do
some responders subsequently relapse? Why are some tumor types particularly resistant to this form of
immunotherapy?
 During the past R01 funding period, major discoveries were made regarding regulation of the expression
of PD-1 and its ligands, having important implications for identifying biomarkers and developing combinatorial
approaches to cancer immunotherapy. A dominant mechanism for PD-L1 upregulation on certain tumors was
revealed as not being constitutive induction but rather adaptive resistance, whereby tumors respond to
“sensing” of immune threat through IFN-g. Conversely, a major cytokine produced by tumor cells, TGF-b, was
shown to enhance TCR-driven PD-1 promoter activity and thus PD-1 expression on T cells, and the associated
molecules GARP and Activin receptor type 1C were revealed to play pivotal roles in sustaining Treg
immunosuppression in the TME. Finally, tumor-intrinsic resistance mechanisms identified by unbiased gene
expression profiling emerged as critical determinants of anti-PD-(L)1 failure. In parallel, significant advances
in multi-dimensional tissue imaging with the so-called “AstroPath” platform have revolutionized our ability to
interrogate the TME, by capturing and analyzing spatially annotated quantitative data.
 This competing renewal will characterize the nature of anti-PD-(L)1 tumor resistance by addressing three
Aims: 1) Identify Treg molecules selectively expressed in PD-(L)1 non-responders; 2) Define tumor
cell-intrinsic pathways mediating anti-PD-(L)1 resistance; and 3) Characterize immune cell and
stromal factors underlying anti-PD(L)1 response/resistance. These studies are anticipated to translate
into the development of new biomarkers and treatment combinations, enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-(L)1."
10772048,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe degenerative muscle disease caused by mutations in the DMD
gene, which encodes dystrophin. The current standard of care, corticosteroid treatment, delays the progression
of muscle dysfunction but has serious side effects. DMD gene therapy and gene editing approaches are
promising but face many challenges. Pharmacological approaches are being identified that could benefit DMD
by modulating pathological mechanisms independent of the dystrophin mutation. However, many small molecule
therapies have had difficulties showing efficacy while progressing through DMD clinical trials, possibly due to
inadequate preclinical evaluation or to targeting mechanisms too late in the disease process. Although DMD is
a progressive disease, there is evidence for early, embryonic- and fetal-stage defects in myogenesis and gene
expression in DMD. In particular, our preliminary studies have identified one of the earliest known DMD
phenotypes: a novel transcriptional trajectory of DMD human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) undergoing
myogenesis. By understanding how these early myogenic and transcriptional defects initiate and how they drive
DMD pathology, we may be better positioned to identify and utilize DMD therapies. The hypothesis of this
proposal is that epigenetic drugs, small molecules that target chromatin modifications and transcriptional
regulation, can ameliorate early DMD transcriptional defects as well as improve downstream DMD pathology.
Certain histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown promise for DMD in mice, zebrafish, and recent
clinical trials. However, beyond these HDACi, epigenetic drugs have not been broadly and systematically studied
for their efficacy and safety to treat DMD. The goals of this proposal are to identify novel epigenetic small
molecules that are beneficial for DMD, by demonstrating effectiveness in multiple DMD models, and, in parallel,
to better characterize the disrupted transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underlying DMD. We propose
three Aims. First, we will identify the classes of epigenetic small molecules that improve the DMD phenotype, by
screening an epigenetic drug library in dmd zebrafish. Our preliminary studies have already identified novel
epigenetic drugs that rescue dmd zebrafish. Second, through single-cell genomics on hiPSC-derived DMD
skeletal muscle, we will generate maps of transcriptome and chromatin packaging defects during the initiation
and progression of DMD. We will test whether epigenetic drugs correct the novel transcriptional dysregulation
phenotype, as well as functional deficits, that we have identified in hiPSC-derived DMD muscle. Third, we will
evaluate epigenetic drugs for efficacy and safety in the DMD rat, assessing clinically relevant functional
outcomes in skeletal and cardiac muscle. This project will provide novel basic scientific insight into the early
epigenetic dysregulation occurring in DMD. The long-term impact will be the development of a three-model
platform, zebrafish, rat and hiPSC lines, for DMD drug discovery and mechanistic and functional validation,
taking advantage of each model system."
10878708,"Prostate Cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Veterans, comprising 30% of
new cancer diagnoses in the VA. Eighty-five percent of men present with localized prostate can-
cer, which is typically treated with active surveillance or curative local therapy using surgery or
radiation therapy. Unfortunately, twenty percent of Veterans undergoing curative local therapy
will develop metastatic recurrence. These men typically receive palliative systemic hormonal
therapy to control their disease. Despite this, over half of men will have cancer progression
within 1-2 years and half will die within 5 years.
Two diverging paradigms have been studied in recent years to improve the survival of men with
recurrent metastatic prostate cancer. First, a subset of patients has oligorecurrent disease, de-
fined as 1-5 sites of metastases. These patients are hypothesized to have an intermediate clini-
cal state in which ablative local therapy with surgery or radiation to all metastatic sites of dis-
ease (metastasis-directed therapy; MDT) can lead to durable disease control and potentially
cure in select patients. Recent Phase II randomized trials have demonstrated improved long-
term progression-free survival with MDT in the absence of systemic therapy.
Yet, 75% of patients receiving MDT for oligorecurrent cancer develop progression in new areas,
arguing that systemic therapy is needed to treat occult metastases. This is supported by data
demonstrating that earlier palliative hormonal therapy is associated with improved survival. In
fact, the second approach that has been studied in recent years, is whether escalating hormonal
therapy by adding novel androgen receptor axis targeted agents or chemotherapy improves out-
comes in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Multiple phase III randomized trials demonstrate
that escalating hormonal therapy with these novel therapeutic agents improves progression-free
survival and overall survival dramatically. Therefore, these agents have been integrated as an
option into today’s standard systemic therapy (SST) for metastatic recurrence.
Given the promise of MDT to induce long-term cancer control and the effectiveness of SST to
prevent further cancer progression, there is an urgent need to determine whether adding MDT
to SST improves disease outcomes further. The primary goal of our study is to determine if add-
ing MDT improves disease control compared to SST alone in Veterans with oligorecurrent pros-
tate cancer. We will conduct a multi-institutional phase II randomized trial comparing SST with
or without MDT. Other goals of the study are to determine any differences in patterns of cancer
progression, survival, quality of life, and the cost-effectiveness of each approach. We also will
determine how RNA transcriptomic analysis and DNA sequencing of the primary tumor from the
original prostate cancer diagnosis can help determine which Veterans benefit the most from
MDT. We will also utilize the VA National Precision Oncology Program to sequence metastases.
The trial was developed and will be conducted in collaboration with the VA Cooperative Studies
Program (CSP), and represents the multidisciplinary collaboration of prostate cancer experts,
MDT experts, clinical trial design experts, and Veterans.
If MDT improves FFS, our study will serve as the basis to develop a definitive phase III random-
ized trial that will be powered to determine if MDT improves overall survival—establishing the
new standard of care."
10772096,"The Overarching Aim of the Yale MPMOD Phenotyping Core is to provide extramural investigators access to
the unique metabolic phenotyping services provided by the Yale MPMOD at a fair and reasonable price, and
empower them to characterize the impact of their genetically manipulated mouse models of diabetes and obesity
on key metabolic parameters and whole body and tissue specific intracellular metabolic fluxes using state-of-
the-art stable and radio-labeled isotope methodology. The Specific Aims of the Yale MPMOD Phenotyping
Core are: 1) To provide the scientific community access to standardized, high quality, unique metabolic
phenotyping services currently available at the Yale MPMOD at a fair and reasonable cost, 2) To continue to
develop novel stable isotope GC-MS, LC-MS/MS and NMR methods to metabolically phenotype whole body and
intracellular metabolism in awake mice, and 3) To participate and collaborate with the National Consortium of
MPMODs and the MPMOD Coordinating Unit to maintain a national database of metabolic phenotyping data in
mouse models of obesity and diabetes. It is anticipated that the results generated by the Yale MPMOD will lead
to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes and obesity and their related metabolic
complications and lead to new therapies. Ultimately, the insights generated from in vivo metabolic phenotyping
in mouse models will facilitate the development of precision medicine approaches targeting metabolic
pathophysiology and its downstream complications."

Increasing the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers for recognizing recent, excessive alcohol use (EAU) in
Veterans is a timely goal of research. EAU is becoming recognized as an emerging health-related problem
especially among veterans returning from combats. As such, there is a need for increased vigilance and action
to identify and counsel at-risk veterans. The diagnosis and care of veteran patients with EAU is hampered by
the lack of tests with high diagnostic performance that can detect dangerous levels of drinking or relapse
during therapy. Such tests would be indispensable for screening and care for veterans with EAU. The
consequences of under-detection of EAU, thus delayed intervention are serious because relative risk of alcohol-
related health conditions is increased with the amounts and duration of alcohol consumed per day. Excessive
alcohol use (EAU) is becoming recognized as an emerging health-related problem especially among veterans
returning from combats. Our preliminary data using the new landscape of proteomic and transcriptomic
approaches have uncovered the pathophysiology of EAU on several pathways; which might lead to
pathology in human. This renewal CSR&D Merit Review Award application seeks the support to define
the roles of the panels of biomarkers; derived from the effect of EAU on inflammatory response to screen
for EAU and quantity of recent alcohol consumption and monitoring for abstinence. We hypothesize that
(i) these biomarkers derived from system biology analyses are useful and have a better diagnostic performance
to screen for EAU and the quantity of recent alcohol consumption in clinical practice, when compared to the
conventional markers and (ii) the combination of these markers into a single risk model prediction using
machine learning and statistical mechanics will revolutionize the way we screen for EAU in clinical practice. To
test this hypothesis, we plan to pursue the following specific aims; SPECIFIC AIM # 1: Determine the effect of
EAU on organ system identified by system biology approach and by detecting, identifying, and comparing the
relative quantity of these novel targets as potential biomarkers for EAU, and SPECIFIC AIM # 2: To develop
and validate of a risk model for prediction of EAU combining aspects of machine learning and statistical
mechanics. If successful, the results from this project will revolutionize the screening methods for veterans
with excessive alcohol use."
10731385,"Although leading cancer-focused organizations such as the American Society of Clinical
Oncology now recommend geriatric assessments for all older adults with cancer, these
assessments have not been widely adopted within VA and elsewhere due to limitations in
resources, geriatrics expertise, and time in busy oncology clinics. The VA National Precision
Oncology Program is profiling tumor genetics in myeloma and other cancers to characterize
disease and personalize therapy in unprecedented fashion. However, truly personalized cancer
treatment for older Veterans must be based not only on tumor “genotype,” but also on older adult
“phenotype.” Dr. Clark DuMontier is a geriatrician and clinical investigator focused on integrating
geriatric measures into oncology. The research proposed for this CDA-2 will advance Dr.
DuMontier’s long-term goal of developing feasible and valid tools to help VA oncologists integrate
frailty and multimorbidity alongside myeloma-specific factors to advance precision oncology for
older Veterans with myeloma. The objectives of this application are to electronically measure
frailty and multimorbidity in over 5000 Veterans age ³ 65 years with myeloma newly treated in VA
from 2004-present using healthcare data that is readily available within VA’s nationally integrated
health system. Preliminary findings demonstrate that frailty and multimorbidity can be rapidly
assessed using diagnostic and procedural codes and data from the electronic health record
(EHR). Aim 1 will determine whether an electronic frailty index, the VA-FI, independently predicts
mortality and hospitalizations in older Veterans with myeloma, and whether it modifies the effect
of initial therapy on these outcomes. Analyses will include important myeloma-specific factors
such as triplet or doublet chemotherapy, stage and cytogenetics, sociodemographic variables,
and prognostic labs. Aim 2 will determine whether multimorbidity patterns independently predict
mortality and hospitalizations in myeloma, and whether they modify the effect of specific regimens
on these outcomes. A machine learning analysis will be applied to 67 chronic conditions
measured within the VA database to define these patterns and their impact in older Veterans with
myeloma. Aim 3 will develop and validate a predictive risk model for mortality that incorporates
frailty and multimorbidity with myeloma-specific factors. Once validated, this model will be
translated into a clinical decision support tool embedded in the VA EHR. This tool will help VA
oncologists to rapidly estimate frailty and multimorbidity and enhance individualized prognosis
and treatment decisions for older Veterans with myeloma. The mentored research and training
program described in this CDA-2 will accelerate Dr. DuMontier’s development into an independent
VA investigator in geriatric oncology. His mentorship team includes Drs. Jane Driver, Nikhil
Munshi, Michael Gaziano, and Mary Brophy—leaders in geriatrics, oncology, and big data science
from the New England Geriatric Research Education Clinical Center (GRECC), the
Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), and the
VA National Precision Oncology Program. Under the guidance of these mentors and in
collaboration with MAVERIC, Dr. DuMontier will pursue training that will provide (1) experience
with large database investigation; (2) expertise in advanced statistical analyses and machine
learning; (3) project management and multidisciplinary collaboration; and (4) communication,
leadership skills, and professional development. This training and mentored research will prepare
him to be competitive for a VA Merit Award toward independence as a VA clinician investigator."

Subconcussive blast is, by definition, not associated with acute or chronic phase symptoms. However,
neuroimaging offers initial evidence of damage to white matter following subconcussive blast. As with mTBI,
subconcussive blast is associated with tremendous spatial and inter-individual heterogeneity resulting from
variability in the events surrounding blast. A significant limitation of subconcussive, mTBI, and PTSD
neuroimaging research results from the comparison of group-averaged data of affected individuals to matched
controls that tends to mask individual-specific features. Fortunately, recent methodological advances in the
acquisition and analysis of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) now offer an unprecedented ability to map individual-
subject-level functional connectivity. Long rs-fMRI scans (> 25 min) coupled with advanced individual-specific
parcellation methods provides quantification of inter-subject heterogeneity. 210 veterans from 4 subject
categories: (1) subconcussive (2) concussive mTBI (3) unexposed controls and (4) blast-unexposed PTSD, will
undergo (1) long rs-fMRI scans, structural MRI, diffusion MRI, (2) assessment of blast exposure, head impact,
and associated clinical symptoms, (3) psychiatric symptoms, and (4) a neurocognitive battery. In Specific Aim
1, we will compare individual-specific maps of functional and structural networks in every subject and between
the 4 subject categories. We hypothesize unique patterns of functional and structural connectivity among
individual subjects in each category. In Specific Aim 2, we will measure the congruence between structural and
functional network architectures. We hypothesize that the structure-function uncoupling in subconcussive and
mTBI groups will originate from structural alterations but the source of uncoupling in PTSD will be from
functional alterations. In Specific Aim 3, we will relate functional and structural network connectivity to the
events surrounding blast exposure, mTBI symptoms, PTSD symptoms, PTSD symptom clusters, depression
symptoms, other neuropsychiatric symptoms, and neurocognitive performance. Support vector regression
methods will train algorithms capable of recognizing individual-specific features of functional connectivity,
structural connectivity, and structure-function coupling that correspond to the subconcussive, mTBI, PTSD, and
control groups. An overwhelming challenge in the diagnosis and clinical management of veterans, is
delineating a complex array or overlapping exposures, histories, symptoms, and clinical signs into distinct
etiologically defined diagnostic entities. We propose analytic methods for unraveling heterogeneity, which
index brain network connectivity metrics derived from neuroimaging. We are taking important strides toward
discovering knowledge that is essential to future development of effective treatments and clinical management.
Mapping individual-specific etiologic pathways and mechanisms of disease will move us one step closer to
implementing precision medicine for Veterans’ health."
10814866,"Summary/Abstract
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a disorder with significant morbidity and mortality that lacks treatments. The
lysosomal/autophagy pathway – a key catabolic mechanism by which cells eliminate damaged cytoplasmic
organelles – is impaired in both experimental and human pancreatitis. Further, genetic alterations specifically
targeting autophagy or lysosomes cause spontaneous pancreatitis in mice. These findings implicate impaired
lysosomal/autophagy pathways in initiating and driving pancreatitis. The mechanisms through which disordering
of these pathways causes the disease remain, however, unknown. Studies in other organs and disease models
showed a critical role for lysosomal/autophagy pathways in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, essential for cell
viability and function. Moreover, recent studies indicate that use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, is
associated with lower incidence of AP and decreased mortality. However, there is little known about cholesterol
metabolism in the exocrine pancreas and its’ dysregulation in pancreatitis. The effects of statins and other
cholesterol-lowering drugs on acinar cell cholesterol homeostasis and AP responses have not been studied. We
here propose a novel hypothesis for the pathogenic mechanism of pancreatitis: that lysosomal/autophagy
dysfunction causes dysregulation of acinar cell cholesterol homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress
and pathologic responses of pancreatitis.
 Our preliminary results indicate that both preclinical models and human pancreatitis are associated with
profound dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in acinar cells, and that lysosomal/autophagy dysfunction
associated with AP plays a key mediatory role in these effects. They further show the role of cholesterol
dysregulation in disease severity, in particular mitochondrial oxidative stress and inflammation.
The hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims:
1). Investigate dysregulation of acinar cell cholesterol homeostasis in experimental and human pancreatitis and
its role in pancreatitis responses.
2). Determine the role of cholesterol dysregulation in pancreatitis caused by disrupted lysosomal/autophagy
pathways.
3). Examine the role of cholesterol dysregulation in mitochondrial oxidative stress leading to inflammation in
pancreatitis.
The proposed research is significant because it will establish cholesterol metabolism as a clinically relevant
modulator of pancreatitis severity and identify potential molecular targets, amenable for pharmacologic
intervention, to normalize cholesterol metabolism and thus reduce pancreatitis severity. In particular, we will
elucidate the mechanisms of the effects of statins and other cholesterol-modulating drugs on pancreatitis."
10825548,"Project Summary. The physiological function of mGluR2 is to negatively regulate endogenous glutamate release and
protect neurons against excitotoxicity. Therefore pharmacological modulation of mGluR2 represents an attractive
therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, including
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Positron emission tomography (PET) is
capable of quantifying biochemical processes in vivo, and a suitable mGluR2 ligand would substantially improve our
understanding of mGluR2-mediated signaling pathway under different pathophysiological CNS disorders, otherwise
inaccessible by ex vivo (destructive) analysis. Quantification of mGluR2 in living brain by PET would provide the
assessment of distribution, target engagement and pharmacodynamic response of novel mGluR2-targeted
neurotherapeutics. To date, no successful examples have been demonstrated to image mGluR2 in humans for drug
discovery and clinical use, representing a significant deficiency of our ability to study this target in vivo. Therefore, we
propose to develop a novel PET ligand that can fill this void, as the first translational imaging tool.
 We are the first groups to develop negative allosteric modulator (NAM) based mGluR2 ligands in cross-species
PET studies, including [11C]QCA. However, this ligand was discontinued due to low brain penetration and marginal
binding specificity in vivo. As our next generation, we identified a lead molecule, MG2-2112, which showed high
binding affinity and excellent selectivity. Our preliminary evaluation confirmed that we have overcome the two major
obstacles for mGluR2 ligand development by achieving: 1) substantially-improved binding affinity, representing the
best compound to date; and 2) high brain permeability and target specificity (characteristic high uptake in mGluR2-
rich striatum and low in mGluR2-poor thalamus/pons). Though MG2-2112 is a promising lead, we are not clear if it is
satisfactory for PET quantification in cross-species study for drug discovery and clinical translation. Thus, we will
advance MG2-2112 as a benchmark and concurrently prepare a series of mGluR2-specific PET ligands. Further
optimization for improved binding specificity and proper brain kinetics, as well as proof-of-concept validations on
human brain tissues, are sought to identify optimal mGluR2 ligands and support target engagement study and efficacy
measurement in drug discovery. The impact of this work is not only to develop the first successful highly-specific
mGluR2 PET ligand for the study of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases-related biological
processes, but also ultimately, via PET imaging validation in higher species, to advance this ligand for potential clinical
translation and monitor target response and safety margins of novel neurotherapeutics for neurodegenerative
diseases, including AD."

 Failure in axon regeneration after nervous system lesion is a major roadblock for
functional recovery. Axon regeneration is controlled by both intrinsic and extrinsic cues
from both neurons and surrounding glial environment. However, our understanding of
glial control of axon regeneration remains incomplete. Here, we investigate axon
regeneration of well-defined sensory neurons in Drosophila larvae. This in vivo model
offers a powerful opportunity to investigate axon regeneration with single-cell resolution
and genetic tractability. Our pilot study has made novel findings by discovering a critical
involvement of glia-neuron interactions, in the form of gliotransmission, in specifying
axon regenerative differences of neuron types. Based on these findings, we hypothesize
that gliotransmission orchestrates neuron type-specific axon regeneration. Specifically,
we propose that axotomy activates Ca2+ signals in glial cells to elicit gliotransmission,
leading to accumulation of extracellular ATP. ATP is then converted by ecto-5’-
nucleotidases to adenosine before activating adenosine receptors in the select neuron
type, resulting in neuron type-specific Ca2+ signals and axon regeneration. In this project,
we will leverage the power of Drosophila genetics and combine it with multidisciplinary
approaches to test this hypothesis. Because axon regeneration mechanisms are
conserved, our findings will likely be relevant to other species including mammals."
10754940,"Maternal healthcare in the US continues to rank poorly in comparison to other developed countries. Maternal
mortality rates in US have been increasing yearly, accounting for 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.
Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in pregnant and postpartum women; however, little
is known regarding the underlying factors leading to this increase, which has been hindered by the lack of
knowledge of how the heart responds to normal pregnancy. Despite this, it is known that during pregnancy, the
heart adapts to meet the increased metabolic demands of maternal organs and the growing fetus. This
adaptation is characterized by reversible cardiac growth and ventricular remodeling, which sustain high cardiac
output during the final trimester of pregnancy. Yet, the molecular programs that support the coordinated
remodeling of the maternal heart during and after pregnancy remain unknown. Coordinated changes in
metabolism could be critical to pregnancy-induced cardiac remodeling, as suggested by their importance in other
contexts. For example, increased cardiac ketone body (KB) metabolism prevents cardiac dysfunction and
remodeling in heart failure, and changes in glucose metabolism regulate exercise-induced cardiac growth.
Nevertheless, surprisingly little is known in the context of pregnancy. This knowledge is important because it
could be leveraged to support maternal cardiac health. There is rationale to expect a link between KB metabolism
and cardiac remodeling. To wit, circulating fatty acids and triglycerides are higher during pregnancy; they supply
energy to highly metabolic tissues, and they are used for liver ketogenesis. Indeed, circulating KBs increase
during late pregnancy in humans and are thought to provide alternative fuel sources for the heart. Furthermore,
our data indicate that the KB metabolism enzyme, β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (Bdh1), is upregulated
in the heart early in pregnancy, followed in late pregnancy by higher levels of circulating KBs and reduced cardiac
glucose catabolism. These findings suggest that KB availability and the capacity of the maternal heart to oxidize
KBs are increased during pregnancy. We hypothesize that higher cardiac KB oxidation during pregnancy may
spare glucose-derived carbon for anabolic pathways to increase the abundance of glucose-derived metabolites
that facilitate cardiac growth. In support of this idea, our preliminary studies show increased glucose-derived
carbon allocation to nucleotides, glycerophospholipids, and amino acids during pregnancy. In this study, we will
test three aims: in Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which KB availability influences cardiac structure and
function during pregnancy; in Aim 2 we will evaluate the impact of cardiac KB utilization on structural and
metabolic remodeling in the maternal heart; and in Aim 3, we will delineate the influence of KB metabolism on
the reversal of pregnancy-induced cardiac remodeling. Knowledge of how cardiac metabolism contributes to
pregnancy-induced cardiac growth will provide a framework for developing interventions to support maternal
cardiac health."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that starts with alterations in
behavior or language and culminates in severe impairment of memory and cognition. While in most cases the
etiology of FTD is unclear, a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common inherited cause
of FTD and the related motor neuron disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Incomplete penetrance of the
C9ORF72 mutation in families with high prevalence of FTD/ALS indicates that either genetic or environmental
factors modify disease risk. Previously we found that mice with loss of function mutations in C9orf72 experienced
the neural inflammatory features of FTD and died if they were raised in environments that displayed distinct
microbial communities in their gut. Sequencing of fecal matter from environments where C9orf72 mutant mice
displayed divergent health outcomes allowed us to nominate 40 candidate bacterial species that were enriched
in the environments where animals got sick and died. In the first Aim of this proposal, we will use our proxy
macrophage cytokine release assay to determine which of these 40 candidate bacterial species activate an
inflammatory response so that 2-3 bacterial strains can be nominated for functional follow-up. In the second Aim,
we will transplant pro-inflammatory bacteria into germ-free C9orf72 mutant mice to identify strains that trigger
neural inflammation and loss of CNS immune privilege. Our studies will help to identify environmental factors
that credibly contribute to observed heterogeneity in FTD patient phenotype and clinical outcome and provide
insight towards selection of dementia patients most likely to benefit from therapies that target the gut microbiome."

Low weight eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa/atypical anorexia nervosa, are severe psychiatric
disorders that often develop in adolescence, have a chronic course, and evidence poor response to treatment
at great public health cost. Two core features of LW-EDs are food avoidance and preoccupation with shape
and weight. Preliminary data from our initial mechanism study indicate that family based interoceptive
exposure (FBT-E) therapy reduces food avoidance, increases autonomous eating and nonjudgement body
awareness, and enhances extinction learning to aversive food cues to a greater degree than existing family-
based therapy (FBT). Feasibility data indicated high retention, treatment fidelity, and established reliable
measures of treatment adherence despite similar short-term (6-week) within-treatment changes in expected
body weight. Long-term (6-month) follow-up of these interventions in open trial indicate significantly higher
expected body weight among those having received FBT-E. Short-term and long-term changes in weight were
highly correlated with changes in expected body weight. Consequently, we will test the confirmatory efficacy of
FBT-E vs FBT and 12-month follow-up in a parallel group randomized clinical controlled trial in 120
adolescents aged 12-18. We have three specific aims, including: (1) to determine short term and long term
efficacy of FBT-E vs FBT in expected body weight, global eating disorder symptoms, and clinical impairment;
(2) to determine efficacy of FBT-E vs. FBT on laboratory measures of autonomous eating, nonjudgmental body
awareness, and extinction learning; and (3) estimate whether temporal precedence and mechanistic value
(mediation) of early changes in autonomous eating, non-judgmental body awareness, and extinction learning
on treatment effects and longitudinal outcomes. Assessments and data analyses will be blinded to treatment.
With N=120 participants (n = 60 per group) we can detect moderate sized effects for primary and secondary
outcomes. Results will provide data to support novel treatment for LW-EDs and provide theoretical robust
model for understanding pathology for children and families that suffer with LW-EDs."

Lack of effective, well-tolerated treatments for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has impeded research examining
the impact of treatment on health outcomes, and it represents a serious lost clinical opportunity to reduce
morbidity and mortality related to OSA. Metabolic modulation may be a prime target to prevent and treat OSA.
One promising, newly identified pathway requiring further exploration is how pharmacologic sodium glucose
co-transporter 2 inhibition (SGLT2i) may impact OSA. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a 2-center
mechanistic clinical trial of N=164 overweight or obese adults (BMI 25-40 kg/m2) diagnosed with moderate to
severe OSA (with and without T2D) randomized to ertugliflozin 15 mg once daily vs. placebo for 6 months to
evaluate the impact of SGLT2i on anatomic, non-anatomic physiologic, and clinical traits of OSA. We will
accomplish this by the following three separate specific aims:
Specific Aim1: Measure the effects of SGLT2i on anatomic OSA traits. Hypothesis 1: SGLT2i will ¯ visceral
and neck fat, ­ airway caliber, ¯ upper airsoft tissue structure volumes, and ¯ Pcrit/Vpass. Sub-aim 1: Explore
the effects SGLT2i on plasma biomarkers of dysfunctional adiposity.
Specific Aim 2: Quantify the effects of SGLT2i on non-anatomic, physiologic OSA traits. Hypothesis 2: SGLT2i
will ¯ LG and ¯ rostral-caudal fluid shifts. Sub-aim 2: Explore the effects SGLT2i on ArTh and Mresp.
Specific Aim 3: Investigate the effects of SGLT2i on clinical outcomes of OSA severity and sleep deficiency.
Hypothesis 3: SGLT2i will improve clinical measures of OSA severity (e.g., AHI) and sleep deficiency. Sub-aim
3: Perform formal mediation analysis to assess whether the effects of SGLT2i on OSA severity and sleep
deficiency clinical outcomes is mediated through individual anatomic and non-anatomic physiologic traits and
markers of dysfunctional adiposity.
For all aims, analyses will account for age, sex as a biological variable, race/ethnicity, obesity class, type 2
diabetes status, and CPAP use. The integrated findings of these aims will create a unique opportunity for a well
powered, mechanistic trial to definitively elucidate the mechanisms of the SGLT2i-OSA relationship. This
knowledge has the potential to yield new insights for pharmacologic therapeutic targets for OSA, determine
which OSA patient phenotypes may be most responsive to SGLT2i, and provide preliminary data for definitive,
prospective phase 3 trials to test the efficacy of pharmacologic SGLT2i on OSA prevention and treatment."

Solving the pathogenesis of rare genetic diseases leads to greater understanding of basic physiology and gene
function. It was recently discovered that gain-of-function mutations in human PDGFRB, encoding platelet-derived
growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), unexpectedly associate with syndromic diseases involving the skin. The
phenotypes involve dermal atrophy resembling accelerated aging or, paradoxically, dermal thickening and
fibrosis with keloid-like scarring. These observations raise important questions about functions of PDGFRβ in
the skin, including the target cell types and signaling pathways responsible for disease. Whether different human
PDGFRB mutations cause distinct disease phenotypes is unclear because of limited numbers of patients to date
and lack of appropriate genetic models. Addressing these questions will shed new light on the role of PDGFRβ
in the skin. The objective is to identify PDGFRβ-regulated mechanisms controlling dermal cells and their
contribution to skin disease and physiology. The central hypothesis is that PDGFRβ in dermal fibroblasts controls
the balance of downstream effectors including STATs and AKT, which are critical for the maintenance of healthy
skin and are imbalanced in disease. Aim 1 will use inducible Cre/lox approaches in mice to induce PDGFRβ
activating mutations in fibroblasts or dermal adipocytes, with combinatorial deletion of STAT family members
and STAT target genes to uncover new downstream mediators of dermal fibrosis. Aim 2 will characterize a new
mouse model with a mutation found in Kosaki overgrowth syndrome, and test the hypothesis that AKT activation
is required for overgrowth with progressive loss of dermal adipose tissue. Aim 3 will characterize a new mouse
model with a Penttinen progeroid syndrome mutation, and test the hypothesis that STAT1 is a central mediator
of the progeroid skin phenotype and anti-growth characteristics of mutant fibroblasts. This project draws on the
PI’s expertise in PDGF signaling to resolve the paradoxical consequences of elevated PDGFRβ signaling in skin
disease. The results of this project will develop genetic models of two human diseases, by dissecting the cell
type-specific role of PDGFRβ signaling in dermal fibrosis and dermal adipose tissue atrophy, and by establishing
the conceptual framework of PDGFRβ-STAT signaling in the skin. This information may point to novel therapeutic
strategies for fibrosis and aging in contexts beyond these rare genetic diseases."

 The prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports a constellation of ‘executive’ cognitive processes that
guide goal-directed behavior. Dysregulation of PFC-dependent cognition is associated with
numerous behavioral disorders. Currently there is a strong need for improved treatments for PFC-
dependent cognitive dysfunction. However, the development of novel treatments is hindered by
our limited understanding of the neurobiology underlying PFC-dependent cognition. In recent
studies we demonstrated that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the caudal, but not
rostral, dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) of male and female rats (outside proestrus) impair two distinct
cognitive processes: working memory and sustained attention. Conversely, inhibition of PFC CRF
neuronal activity or blockade of CRF receptors, locally or globally in the brain, improved PFC-
dependent cognition. Interestingly, the regulatory actions of CRF across these distinct cognitive
processes involve distinct pathways: local release for working memory and extra-PFC release for
sustained attention. The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MDthal) plays a central role in the
regulation of PFC-dependent function. Preliminary studies indicate that MDthal plays a prominent
role in the sustained attention actions of PFC CRF neurons. We recently demonstrated that the PFC
CRF neurons are comprised of both glutamatergic (CRFGlu, 85%) and GABAergic (CRFGABA, 15%)
subpopulations. The proposed multidisciplinary studies will provide a better understanding of
neural mechanisms that underlie the cognitive actions of PFC CRF neurons. Aim 1 uses recently
developed viral vector-based chemogenetic manipulations to determine the cognitive actions of
CRFGlu and CRFGABA neurons. Aim 2, building on preliminary observations tests the hypothesis that
the sustained attention (an possibly working memory) actions of PFC CRF neurons involve
projections to the
MDthal. Aim 3 examines the neural coding actions of caudal dmPFC
CRFGlu and
CRFGABA across the PFC-MDthal circuit. Collectively, these studies will provide novel insight into the
neurobiology of PFC-dependent cognition. In doing so, these studies may provide a better
understanding of the neural bases of PFC cognitive dysfunction and lead to novel treatment
strategies for PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction."

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represents 30% of adult leukemia and is still incurable. According to the
National Cancer Institute, approximately 21,250 new cases of CLL and 4,320 deaths from CLL are projected in
the United States alone in 2021. Although the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) is an effective targeted
therapy for CLL, approximately 50% of BTKi-treated CLL patients have dropped out of the therapy due to
chronic adverse effects. Additionally, significantly increased numbers of CLL patients treated with BTKi or other
kinase inhibitors have developed the more medically challenging diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Novel therapy
that can directly target CLL or be rationally combined with BTKi is highly desirable. The stimulator of interferon
genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein critical for sensing cytoplasmic DNA and
promoting production of type I interferons, thereby boosting immune responses. STING agonists, such as
ADU-S100, have been used as combination immunotherapy with Pembrolizumab in clinical trials to treat
advanced solid tumors and lymphomas, and these therapeutic applications of STING agonists are based on
the main known function of STING in eliciting anti-tumor immunity. We were the first to show that STING
agonists directly induce potent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in B cell-derived malignancies including CLL,
while these agonists induce production of interferons in melanoma, hepatoma and lung cancer cells without
suppressing their growth. Apoptosis of CLL, B cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma requires STING, because
genetic deletion of STING results in resistance of all these cells to STING agonist-mediated apoptosis.
Apoptosis of these cells is not due to the production of inflammatory cytokines but may involve the prolonged
presence of agonist-bound STING. Together with our new preliminary results showing that mutation-mediated
activation of STING causes rapid degradation of the B cell receptor (BCR) and significantly reduced BCR
signaling (disadvantageous for CLL survival), and that novel serine residues on STING are phosphorylated in
agonist-stimulated malignant B cells, we propose to identify and characterize differential phosphorylation and
interacting partners of activated STING to further understand the mechanisms by which activated STING
causes BCR degradation and apoptosis in CLL. Since our preliminary data show that STING deficiency can
lead to increased levels of the BCR and BCR signaling in mouse CLL, and that mouse and human malignant
CLL cells significantly downregulate their expression levels of STING, we will test whether STING-
downregulated or STING-deficient CLL cells are less sensitive to BTKi. We will also examine how such altered
STING expression and phosphorylation can regulate the survival, progression and chemoresistance of CLL.
Based on our hypothesis that activation of STING can lead to the degradation of the BCR and render CLL cells
more sensitive to BTKi, we propose to combine STING agonists with BTKi to treat CLL."
10765662,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DLB is a more rapidly progressive disease than AD, with a median time from diagnosis
to death or nursing home admission that is half that seen in AD and is associated with extensive burden on both
patients and family caregivers. There is a great unmet medical need, with no approved treatments, only AD and
Parkinson’s disease (PD) drugs used off-label to partially or temporarily relieve some of its severe cognitive and
motor symptoms. The proposed treatment, neflamapimod, an orally bioavailable, highly specific inhibitor of the
intracellular enzyme p38 mitogen activated protein kinase alpha (p38α), is in clinical development by EIP Pharma
with a phase 2a study in DLB and phase 2 studies in early AD already completed. Preclinical data indicate that
neflamapimod, through inhibiting p38α, therapeutically targets specific pathogenic mechanisms underlying
dysfunction and degeneration of neurons in a part of the brain called the basal forebrain, abnormalities in which
are considered to be the major pathogenic drivers of the dementia in DLB. For example, neflamapimod increased
the number of functioning basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Ts2 transgenic mice that, along with modeling
Down syndrome, develop neurodegeneration in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Together, such evidence
provides a strong scientific rationale for neflamapimod as a disease modifying treatment for DLB. In accordance
with this, neflamapimod received Fast-Track designation by the FDA for DLB. A recently completed phase 2a
exploratory (i.e., hypothesis-generating) clinical trial (NCT04001517) in 91 patients with mild-to-moderate DLB,
also receiving cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, provided preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy of neflamapimod
on various cognitive, motor, and functional aspects of the disease. The proposed phase 2b trial will confirm and
expand upon these results. The Specific Aims are to, in the context of performing a phase 2b randomized,
double- blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week treatment study of neflamapimod (40mg TID) in 160 subjects with
mild-to-moderate DLB: (Aim 1). Demonstrate that neflamapimod improves cognition and function, based on
primary (Neuropsychological Test Battery) and secondary (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes, Timed
Up and Go test, The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of Change) efficacy
measures in patients with mild-to-moderate DLB receiving cholinesterase inhibitors; (Aim 2). Assess
neuropsychiatric outcomes and safety/tolerability during treatment with neflamapimod in patients with DLB; and
(Aim 3). Assess effects of neflamapimod on electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of DLB, specifically beta
functional connectivity and alpha-reactivity; both markers of basal forebrain cholinergic dysfunction. Successful
completion of this phase 2b trial will inform our pivotal phase 3 trial, advancing neflamapimod as a disease-
modifying treatment for DLB and providing hope for these patients and their families."

 Papillomaviruses (PV) cause slowly proliferating epithelial tumors called warts or papillomas. These are
very common infections of skin and the cervical, genital, anal, and oral mucosa. Infections with a subset of
human and several animal PVs can progress to cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal malignancies.
Because human PV infections are believed to be species specific, a fully representative model of HPV
pathogenesis is not available in a common laboratoryanimal.
 There is no specifically antiviral therapy for early-stage HPV infection and for HPV-associated cancers.
Currently, most treatments involve physical destruction or surgical removal of the infected and nearby
tissues. In low resource countries, the lack of testing and scarce availability of surgical procedures results in
very high prevalence of HPV-induced cancers. There is a critical unmet need for an in vivo system to test
novel therapeutics aimed at eliminating HPV infection. A tractable mouse model to test antiviral agents
specifically designed to interrupt HPV protein activities would have a major impact on pre-clinical drug
development.
 The experiments proposed in this R21 grant will investigate the expression and maintenance of HPV-16
genomes in murine cell culture and in live mice. Several forms of HPV-16 genomes will be tested, including
the creation of a mouse papillomavirus genome in which the native E6 and E7 genes are replaced by HPV-
16 E6 and E7. These oncoproteins are necessary for both viral genome replication and always expressed in
HPV-associated malignancies and are therefore excellent targets for antiviral targeting. If HPV-16 is
successfully propagated and the infection persists in mice, these murine models would be an important
advance before clinical testing in human. Furthermore, this would also serve as a useful model to investigate
the functions of HPV oncoproteins in genome maintenance and neoplastic progression. An antiviral treatment
that cures early and persistent HPV-16 infections would reduce the risk and burden of progression to cancer
that afflicts millions of people throughout the world."

Delirium (acute confusion), is a major complication of surgery in older patients, strongly associated with long
term cognitive decline (LTCD) and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Prevention of
postoperative delirium and its long-term complications would be advanced if we could better identify at-risk
patients preoperatively, and if targeted pathophysiologically-based interventions could be implemented. To
address these gaps, we conducted the NIA-funded “Advancing the Understanding of Postoperative Delirium
Mechanisms via Multi-Omics” R01 project and program project that funded the SAGES (Successful Aging after
Elective Surgery) I and II studies. We identified and validated pre- and post-operative delirium protein
signatures, demonstrating that pro-inflammatory proteins, acute phase reactants, angiogenic, and neuronal
injury markers are elevated in patients who develop delirium. A model of delirium pathophysiology has
emerged that stipulates a systemic pre-inflammatory state predisposes to a hyperactive inflammatory response
from major surgery, leading to delirium, and potentially LTCD and AD/ADRD in individuals with a vulnerable
brain. While intriguing, this model does not fully address the complex inter-relationship between delirium and
AD/ADRD. For our R01 renewal, we hypothesize that AD/ADRD susceptibility and accelerated biological aging
are key predisposing factors for delirium and delirium with LTCD, which in turn may increase risk for
AD/ADRD. SomaScan-based plasma proteomic signatures predicting AD/ADRD up to 20 years before onset,
and proteomic aging clocks, panels of plasma proteins measuring biological aging relative to chronological
age, have been developed and extensively validated in large cohorts. We will use the state-of-the-art
SomaScan proteomics platform that measures 7,000 proteins to test our hypotheses that AD/ADRD proteomic
signatures (Aim 1) and proteomic aging clocks (Aim 2) predict postoperative delirium and delirium with LTCD.
We will capitalize upon the pre- and post-operative banked specimens from SAGES I (N=560) with continuous
follow-up to 72 months after major scheduled surgery, and a second, recently accrued independent cohort,
SAGES II (N=400), with similar characteristics and follow-up to 18 months. We will combine proteins from the
AD/ADRD and aging proteomic signatures, along with additional proteins from the 7,000 protein SomaScan
covering many biological pathways, for a deep etiopathological characterization of the plasma proteome for
delirium and delirium with LTCD in SAGES I (Aim 3) and independent validation of the proteomic signature for
delirium using both SomaScan and ELISA with plasma from SAGES II (Aim 4). Our R01 renewal Aims will
provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying delirium pathogenesis and its association with
AD/ADRD and biological aging. This project holds great promise to develop accurate blood-based biomarkers
for preoperative delirium risk prediction, postoperative prognostication of LTCD following delirium, and to lay
the groundwork for targeted interventions to improve outcomes of older adults at risk of delirium."

Powered prosthetic knee and ankle joints can actively generate torque, potentially enabling safe and efficient
performance of more demanding mobility tasks, such as ascending ramps and stairs or performing sit-to-stand
transitions, and improving energy efficiency. However, available powered components have been almost
exclusively developed for and tested by individuals ambulating at Medicare Functional Classification Level
(MFCL) K3-or K4. Individuals designated as K2-level ambulators (i.e., have a more limited ambulation
capacity) are typically prescribed a passive prosthesis, but these individuals have been shown to benefit from
more advanced microprocessor-controlled knees and may gain additional benefit from powered components.
Because available powered components are heavy, we developed lightweight, fully powered knee and ankle
components that can be used separately or together and are appropriate for K2-level ambulators. These
devices will allow us to evaluate the benefits associated with providing power at the knee, ankle, or knee and
ankle, and the tradeoffs associated with the additional weight and control complexity of one or more powered
components. Our goal is to determine how powered prosthetic components effect function—in terms of
metabolic cost, gait biomechanics, and functional mobility in K2-level ambulators with a unilateral transfemoral
amputation, who use a prescribed passive prosthesis. We will recruit 20 individuals, who will participate in
three aims, with the expectation that 15 will complete the study. For Aim 1, subjects will be fit first with a fully
passive device (Ottobock C-Leg 4 MPK and a Triton 1C60 Foot) and then to our fully powered device (knee-+
ankle prosthesis). They will be trained to use each device before completing the Amputee Mobility Predictor
with Prosthesis (AMPPRO) (primary outcome) as well as metabolic and biomechanical assessments, a set of
standard outcome measures, and self-report surveys (secondary outcomes). For Aim 2, we will evaluate
combinations of powered knee + passive ankle and passive knee + powered ankle, in random order. Subjects
will be trained to use each device, and the same primary and secondary outcome measures will be performed
to assess functional benefits and the effects of additional weight at the knee or ankle. In Aim 3, we will provide
intensive training to enable subjects to independently perform typical activities of daily living and achieve
personal mobility goals using the powered knee + ankle device, to determine what level of improvement K2-
level ambulators can attain. Subjects will again complete the same primary and secondary outcome measures
using the powered device and will repeat these measures using the passive device from Aim 1, to
accommodate carryover of training effects from previous Aims. The anticipated outcome is an understanding of
how power and the weight of prosthetic components affect function in K2-level ambulators, which will enable
optimal selection of components to improve functional mobility in individuals who are designated as limited
community ambulators and currently restricted to passive devices."

Despite the tremendous clinical success of immunotheraputics, little is known regarding IgG2-4 biology relative
to IgG1. Our long-term goal is to understand how glycosylation of antibodies regulates, and is regulated, by
immune responses. The overall objective of this application is to examine the regulation of extracellular
sialylation of IgG, and understand how IgG sialylation exerts anti-inflammatory activity. Studies over the last
decade have illuminated the importance of IgG1 glycosylation, little is known about the contribution of
glycosylation to other IgG subclasses or the regulation of IgG sialylation. We recently demonstrated sialylation
of IgG during inflammation occurs extracellularly in situ following administration of soluble glycosyltransferases,
termed B4ST6Fc. Our central hypothesis is that extracellular sialylation by B4ST6Fc conveys type II FcγR binding
and anti-inflammatory activity selectively to IgG1 and IgG3. Our hypothesis is informed by preliminary data
shown here in the Approach subsection of the Research Strategy section. Extracellular sialylation in situ of
pathogenic mouse IgG in the kidneys or paws during autoantibody-induced disease attenuates two distinct
models of autoimmune disease. Further, we show sialylation of IgG1 and IgG3 results in anti-inflammatory
activity in vivo, and DC-SIGN binding in vitro. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is understanding
the contribution of Fc glycosylation to all IgG subclasses will enable new insights into IgG biology, and may lead
to development of innovative antibody-based therapies. We will test our central hypothesis and, thereby, attain
the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims using a combination of biophysical
experiments, and in vitro and in vivo functional assays.
1) Define the regulation of extracellular IgG sialylation during autoimmune disease. Hypothesis: B4ST6Fc
reduces SLE nephritis by sialylation of pathogenic IgG1 and IgG3 with the aid of nucleotide-sugar substrates
released by deposited platelets.
2) Identify the molecular determinants of sialylated IgG anti-inflammatory activity. Hypothesis: a specific
amino acid sequence that is unique to IgG1 and IgG3 and absent from IgG2 and IgG4, in combination with N297
sialylation, results in DC-SIGN binding ability and anti-inflammatory activity."

This proposal will elucidate how two specific proteins in mosquito saliva influence the early stage of

(SAMSP) 1 and SAMSP2. Our preliminary data shows that SAMSP1 plays a role in facilitating Plasmodium
infection in mice and that SAMSP2 has immunomodulatory activity. This proposal will now examine the
importance of SAMSP1 and SAMPS2 in influencing the initial stage of Plasmodium infection in mice. Gene
silencing and antibody blocking studies will assess the role of these proteins in the early stages of murine
infection. In vivo two-photon microscopy of the dermis, and in vitro assays to assess movement and immune
modulation, will delineate the effects of SAMSP1 and SAMSP2 on sporozoite activity. Understanding the
importance of SAMSP1 and SAMSP2 in Plasmodium infection will hopefully lead to new strategies to combat
malaria."

Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for the life-threatening disease
listeriosis. Although Lm produces numerous virulence factors, the secreted pore-forming toxin LLO is
indispensable for pathogenesis. LLO is secreted at all stages of the Listeria intracellular life cycle and binds to
cholesterol to form transmembrane pores. This virulence factor perforates the membrane of the Listeria-
containing endocytic vacuoles to release the bacterium into its replicative niche, the cytosol. It was recently
established that LLO also perforates the host cell plasma membrane, which promotes host cell invasion. It
remains to elucidate how infected cells maintain viability despite perforation of their plasma membranes and how
this low-grade perforation impacts the course of Listeria infection. The work performed in Aim 1 will establish
novel mechanisms that maintain viability of infected cells despite perforation of their plasma membranes by LLO.
Preliminary studies, via screening of a large siRNA library, led to the identification of novel families of host
proteins that were not previously known to repair the plasma membrane of toxin-perforated cells. The Aim 1
studies will establish the mechanisms of action of these novel proteins. Specifically, they will determine the role
plasma membrane depolarization plays in organizing calcium-dependent lysosome exocytosis, leading to the
release of cytoprotective cathepsins on the cell surface. Aim 1 will also establish a new role for the septins, a
family of cytoskeletal proteins, in plasma membrane repair. These studies will employ high-speed and super-
resolution microscopy to analyze the molecular assemblies that orchestrate plasma membrane repair. The Aim
2 studies will establish the impact of plasma membrane perforation by LLO on Listeria intracellular survival and
the innate immune response of antigen-presenting cells. We showed that transient plasma membrane
perforation by LLO triggers Ca2+ influx-dependent activation of conventional PKCs on the endosomal network, a
signaling event that is critical for Listeria phagosome escape. Aim 2 will identify the PKCs effectors by SILAC-
based quantitative proteomic approach and how they contribute to the release of Listeria into the cytosol. Plasma
membrane perforation also causes K+ efflux, which is known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Aim 2 will
dissect the role of low-grade plasma membrane perforation in the maturation of antigen presenting cells to
enhance T cell immunity, in vitro and in vivo. This work is expected to broadly impact the development of vaccines
and novel therapeutic strategies for a wide range of diseases in which pore-forming toxins are employed by
pathogens."

 Corneal neovascularization (NV) can be caused by severe corneal injury or infection and is a leading cause
of blindness. Balance of pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic factors are important to maintain avascular
corneal tissue. Pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGFA and FGF2 are highly induced in inflamed corneas and
lead to activation of its receptor proteins such as VEGFR2 and FGFR2. Membrane-type 1 matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP-14) is involved in remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) through its proteolytic
activity. Recent studies have revealed that MMP-14 is a regulator of VEGFA/VEGFR2-mediated corneal NV via
unique and selective cleavage of VEGFR1 which is a decoy receptor for VEGFR2. FGF2-induced corneal NV is
delayed in MMP-14 knockout (KO) mice, indicating there is some correlation between FGF2 and MMP-14.
However, how MMP-14 interacts with FGF2 is still largely unknown. The goal of this application is to characterize
mechanism of MMP-14 on regulation of FGFR2 levels via ADAM-9 enzyme. We demonstrated that FGFR2 level
was low in MMP-14 KO corneal fibroblast cells. On the other hand, ADAM-9, which is substrate of MMP-14, was
higher in MMP-14 KO fibroblast than WT cells. We have also discovered that expression of MMP-8, MMP-9, and
ADAM-17, all of which are underlying FGF2/FGFR2-system, were highly induced in WT than MMP-14 KO cells
upon stimulation of FGF2. Thus, inhibition of MMP-14 can reduce FGF2/FGFR2-mediated corneal NV and
inflammation. Furthermore, our results show that FDA-approved small molecule drugs, clioquinol, chloroxine,
and folic acid, all of which contain a quinoline scaffold, inhibit MMP-14 enzyme activity. We propose three specific
aims: (1) Mechanism of two enzyme cascades, MMP-14 and ADAM-9, to regulate FGFR2 level and expression
of FGF2/FGFR2-mediated MMPs; (2) investigate the effect of MMP-14 in FGF2/FGFR2-mediated corneal
inflammation; (3) Characterize quinoline analogs as selective MMP-14 inhibitors. We will complete these aims
using innovative techniques from molecular biology and biophysics in vitro and in vivo."

 Genetic studies have identified sequence variants in several genes that are predominantly expressed in
microglia and are associated with either enhanced risk or resilience to Alzheimer Disease (AD). Our
preliminary experiments reveal that the proteins encoded by some of these genes (e.g. TREM2, PLCG2, ABI3)
likely function as components of an intracellular signaling pathway downstream of the TREM2 receptor. This
cascade regulates microglial function in response to TREM2 activation. Crucially, several of these proteins
(e.g. ABI3) or their interacting proteins (e.g. BLNK, an interactor with PLCG2) contain low complexity and
intrinsically disordered motifs. These motifs are characteristic of proteins that phase separate to form
biomolecular condensates. Our preliminary experiments confirm that these proteins do indeed phase
separate to form two biomolecular condensates. One contains PLCG2. The other contains ABI3. Both are
regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Crucially, AD-associated mutations alter these
condensate-regulating PTMs and alter microglial migration and phagocytosis. Our observations suggest that
both condensates play a central role in regulating microglial functions relevant to AD and aging. Consequently,
this signaling pathway, and the biomolecular condensates within it, are likely to contain unrecognised
molecular targets for biomarkers and therapeutics to manage microglial dysfunction in aging and AD.
 This proposal will develop two critical enabling resources that will underpin future work.
First, we will create human iPSC-derived microglial expressing mEmerald + SPOT and mScarlet + HA tags
CRISPR engineered into the endogenous ABI3 and PLCG2 genes. This tool will allow simultaneous
investigation of the biophysics and cell biology of both condensates in living cells. The pluripotent nature of
iPSCs will allow future analysis of these condensates in other cell types without additional resources. Second,
we will develop novel protein purification and mass spectrometry workflows to obtain a more complete
inventory of the proteins within these condensates. We will initially focus on simple immunopurification
protocols to identify stable interacting proteins. We will exploit the HA/SPOT tags and robust, well-
characterized antibodies to these tags to coIP PLCG2 and ABI3 with their interacting partners, which will be
identified by LC-MS/MS. As proof of principle, ~10 binders will be authenticated as real condensate
components using reciprocal coIP and colocalisation studies in human cultured microglia and brain sections.
The authenticated condensate partners will be intrinsically useful. However, the validated workflows developed
here will support future, large-scale studies in human iPSC derived microglia under various conditions (TREM2
activation, aging, AD-associated sequence variants). These resources will underpin future work by the
field to understand how the condensates regulate microglial function, and uncover molecular targets
for precision biomarkers and therapies to manage microglial dysfunction in aging and in AD."

Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG
repeat tract in the 3’ untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The primary therapeutic target in DM1 is the
mutant DMPK RNA encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp), which forms toxic intra-nuclear
aggregates or CUGexp foci in patient cells. We have developed an RNA-based screening strategy to
identify small molecules that selectively modulate the DMPK CUGexp RNA without affecting the normal
DMPK transcript. In a pilot screen of 2,500 compounds we identified a prototype small molecule MDI16,
which effectively reverses critical DM1 pathological features in both patient cells and in the HSALR mouse
model of DM1. As identification of multiple leads greatly enhances the probability of a small molecule
therapy for DM1, we used this screening strategy to identify 30 novel hits from 40,000 diverse drug-like
small molecules of the MSSR-UCLA library, which has undergone extensive filtering against liabilities. This
panel of hits show better safety and efficacy in reducing CUGexp foci when compared to MDI16 in patient
cells. Importantly, comparative analysis demonstrates that our hits perform on par with antisense
oligonucleotides directed against CUGexp and better than DM1 small molecule therapeutics published in
the literature. In this application we propose to identify lead compounds by rank-ordering the efficacy,
potency, selectivity and safety of our hit panel in reversing key DM1 pathological features including the
formation of CUGexp foci, aberrant RNA splicing, SHARP mis-localization, elevated CUGBP1 and GSK3b
levels in DM1 patient myoblasts. Biochemical assays will be used to determine the mechanism of action
of top-ranked hits, which will be tested for their in vivo efficacy in reversing DM1 skeletal muscle disease
in the HSALR DM1 mouse model. Blood brain barrier penetrance of the hits will be tested in a novel bi-
transgenic mouse model that expresses CUGexp foci in the brain. As there is no effective treatment for
DM1, the identification of candidate therapeutic compounds offers hope for patients with this debilitating
disease."

mechanisms of mast cells in mediating ‘non-allergic’ ocular pathologies. Our laboratory has made substantial
progress in understanding how ocular mast cells contribute to the non-allergic inflammatory response. Reports
from our lab provide evidence that (i) epithelial cell-derived interleukin-33 activates mast cells in an IgE-
independent manner and that mast cells (ii) as resident immune cells initiate neutrophil infiltration by releasing
CXCL2, and (iii) promote pathological growth of blood and lymph vessels in part by secreting high levels of
VEGFs. Moreover, our robust preliminary findings indicate that mast cells augment the tissue-damaging function
of neutrophils and that deficiency of mast cells results in faster regression of mature pathological corneal vessels.
However, the exact mechanisms by which mast cells interact with neutrophils and vascular cells to promote their
pathological functions are not well defined.
 In accordance with our laboratory’s expertise in immunological studies and our well-established murine
models of corneal injury and neovascularization, we propose a series of novel experiments to decipher the
function of mast cells as an orchestrator of inflammation and tissue damage. Our pilot investigations show that
mast cells express high levels of neutrophil (granulocyte)-stimulating factors, GM-CSF and G-CSF. In Aim 1, we
will test the hypothesis that Mast cell-derived granulocyte stimulating factors (GM-CSF and G-CSF) promote the
release of tissue-damaging cytokines and enzymes by neutrophils following corneal injury. Specifically, we will
assess the effect of GM-CSF versus G-CSF deficient mast cells (using CRISPR-Cas9) and neutralizing antibody
treatment on (i) neutrophil effector function and survival using our standardized in vitro co-culture assays and (ii)
neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in the corneal injury model. In Aim 2, based on our preliminary data of mast
cells expressing high levels of vessel stabilizing Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), we will test the hypothesis that Mast cells
juxtaposing pathological vessels prolong vascular endothelial cell (VEC) survival and maintain vessel integrity
by secreting Ang1. Specifically, we will determine the effect of (i) mast cells and VECs interaction on Ang1-Tie2
ligand-receptor axis, (ii) Ang1-deficient mast cells on the stability of pathological blood vessels. We will also
evaluate the relative therapeutic efficacy of topical application of Ang1 blocked versus general mast cell inhibitor
in accelerating vessel regression. It is anticipated that the completion of these aims will elucidate as-yet-unknown
mechanisms of mast cell function in non-allergic inflammation and provide a framework to develop new
therapeutics for tissue injury and angiogenesis."

Sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and a marker for
Alzheimer’s disease pathology. The sleep-wake cycle affects the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of
proteins critical to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. We recently reported that overnight sleep disruption
increases CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) levels by ~30% via increased production/release. Orexins (also called
hypocretins) are wake-promoting neuropeptides. Chronic administration of a dual orexin receptor antagonist
(DORA) to increase sleep in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice decreased both the soluble
concentration of Aβ in interstitial fluid and amyloid plaque formation. Our preliminary data shows that a DORA,
suvorexant, acutely decreases the ratio of phosphorylated tau-181 (pT181) to unphosphorylated tau-181
(T181) in CSF. Although previous studies examined sleep-mediated changes in CSF Aβ and tau over hours, it
is unknown how chronic administration of DORAs affect plasma and CSF tau, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), Aβ,
and other Alzheimer’s disease fluid biomarkers in individuals with Alzheimer’s pathology. In this project, we will
test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with suvorexant for 6 months will decrease CSF pT181/T181 and
other CSF and plasma AD biomarkers. In this project, we will use an innovative adaptive trial design to test the
potential of chronic treatment with suvorexant for secondary prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. 200 cognitively
normal, amyloid-positive adults with symptomatic insomnia age ≥65 years will be randomized to receive
placebo or suvorexant for 6 months. Each participant will undergo polysomnography as well as lumbar and
venous puncture to sample CSF and blood at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. We will test the hypothesis
that chronic treatment with suvorexant will decrease CSF pT181/T181 as well as determine the effect on CSF
plasma Aβ, CSF and plasma tau, other forms of CSF and plasma p-tau, and CSF markers for immune
response (microglial function), synaptic function, and non-tau measures of neuronal degeneration. Optimal trial
design is essential prior to launching a full secondary prevention trial with a maximum chance of success. This
study will provide critical information for designing Alzheimer’s disease secondary prevention trial using
suvorexant obtaining data on pharmacokinetics, safety, and chronic effects of suvorexant on multiple soluble
Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers."
10834968,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This overdose epidemic in the United States (US) is evolving, and adequate understanding of the behavioral
patterns of polysubstance use is critical. Polysubstance use occurs frequently with both prescription and
recreational psychoactive drugs. However, patterns of current polysubstance use have not been evaluated in
the general population. Delineating the nature of the behavior can help shift focus beyond opioids for
combating this epidemic. This research will utilize an existing nationally representative drug survey (~60,000
respondents per year) and conduct a new follow-up polysubstance survey surrounding personal experiences in
life relevant to drug use. The overall objective of this research will be to better understand today’s
polysubstance use behaviors among the general population. We will do this in three ways. First, present-day
behavioral patterns of polysubstance users in the general population will be characterized using latent class
analysis to define unique behavioral risk profiles and quantity their prevalence. Second, critical time points in
drug behavior progression will be explored. Among current drug users completing the follow-up survey, a latent
profile analysis to characterize the trajectories, or profiles, which characterize drug use will be evaluated.
Finally, this research will integrate upstream factors such as interpersonal, community, and societal level
factors measured on the follow-up survey. This research will be the first to quantify the prevalence of these
factors and incorporate them into a predictive model to classify polysubstance use based on a person’s life
experiences and not their drug use directly. Finding meaningful and impactful points of intervention is key to
effectively reducing the health risks associated with polysubstance use in the future. This approach addresses
the evolving drug overdose epidemic by quantifying the complexities of substance use disorders among the
general population, delineating the profiles of changing risk across the life span to find opportunities for
intervention, and evaluating the predictive value of upstream factors for classifying polysubstance use. The
information gleaned from this project can be leveraged -for real-world interventions."

 Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) is playing an increasingly important role in determining protein 3D
structures. By structural elucidation of cross-links (i.e., cross-linked peptides resulting from digestion of cross-
linked proteins or protein complexes), CLMS can determine distance constraints between specific functional
groups that can be used to guide structural modeling and docking of proteins and protein complexes. Further
quantitative analysis of cross-links would allow exploration of dynamic protein conformational changes in
solution, a challenging task for traditional structural biology techniques. However, absolute quantitative analysis
of cross-links is very challenging, due to lack of standard cross-linked peptides. To tackle this issue, we propose
to develop a novel absolute quantitative cross-linking mass spectrometry (aqCLMS) using coulometric mass
spectrometry (CMS), a method recently developed in our laboratory for absolute quantitation without using
standards. It is based on electrochemical oxidation of cross-links to produce electric current and the
measurement of the oxidation yield by MS, therefore eliminating the need of using any standards for absolute
quantitation. An aqCLMS method would enable: 1) quantitative analysis and comparison among all cross-links
at one particular or different conformational states, greatly increasing information about residue accessibilities
and their distance constraints in comparison with traditional CLMS; 2) evaluating absolute quantities of transient
protein complexes that form during a particular biological event, which is difficult to measure using existing
techniques. We foresee that our aqCLMS method is very informative in probing dynamic protein conformations,
which would have high impact in structural biology and drug discovery.
 In this project, we propose to use this aqCLMS approach to probe and quantify the conformational structures
of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC)-mediated complexes, specifically BRD4-PROTAC-CRBN. A key
step in PROTAC is the formation of an induced protein complex where a degrader molecule recruits an E3 ligase
to the protein of interest (POI) to facilitate the ubiquitination of the POI, eventually leading to its proteasomal
degradation. Thus, rational design of PROTACs will require a structural understanding of target-PROTAC-E3
ternary complexes, which is, however, still very limited. In this project, in combination with advanced molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, aqCLMS would provide deep insights into the dynamic nature of the PROTAC-
mediated ternary structure ensemble beyond what is seen in the crystal structures."

The overall goal of this K01 award is to provide Gabriella McLoughlin, PhD, MS, with the training and
mentorship to establish an independent program of research focused on improving implementation of Policy,
Systems, and Environmental (PSE) interventions for childhood obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.
Childhood obesity disparities have been exacerbated in recent years, such that children from racial/ethnic
minority and low-income backgrounds are most at risk. Multiple factors, such as increased food insecurity
resulting in a low-quality diet, contribute to this increased threat. Childhood obesity tracks into adulthood,
increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, and warranting sustainable interventions for youth to address
social determinants of health. Since children and adolescents consume over half of their energy intake at
school, providing free nutrient-rich breakfast and lunch to low-income youth through Universal School Meals
(USM) is a key PSE approach to addressing obesity disparities. Adoption of USM is linked with reductions in
obesity risk for low-income students, improved diet quality, reduced food insecurity, and enhanced academic
achievement outcomes. Unfortunately, schools adopting USM report consistent challenges to its
implementation such as low student participation and financial difficulty in adhering to Federal nutrition
requirements. Programs and policies designed to mitigate health disparities for obesity cannot make the most
impact if they are not reaching their target population. Because the federal reimbursement rate for schools is
tied to the number of students receiving school meals, maintaining participation is critical to making USM
financially feasible. The purpose of this K01 award is to conduct an implementation mapping procedure with
the School District of Philadelphia (SDP), resulting in the development and testing of an equity-focused
implementation strategy for USM. This will be achieved through three aims: 1) Investigate determinants of
USM implementation through a health equity lens; 2) Develop and tailor a USM implementation strategy
through a community-engaged approach; and 3) Evaluate the implementation and student health outcomes of
the implementation strategy. To accomplish these aims and prepare for a larger implementation effectiveness
trial, the applicant will receive rigorous formal training in 1) assessing implementation determinants grounded
in health equity 2) community-engaged implementation mapping, 3) randomized controlled trials, and 4) cost
analysis of implementation under the mentorship of Drs. Jennifer Fisher, Omar Martinez, Resa Jones, Ross
Brownson, Alex Dopp, and Shiriki Kumanyika. Temple University is the ideal setting for this work given a
longstanding relationship with the local community, facilitating Dr. McLoughlin's collaboration with SDP and
completion of the study aims through a community-engaged approach. This K01 award holds significant
potential for public health impact and will enable Dr. McLoughlin to establish a rigorous program of research to
improve PSE implementation and reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease risk in vulnerable populations."

Certain human nuclear long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent well-established promising targets for the
treatment of cancer, developmental and viral diseases; manipulating their levels is expected to provide
therapeutic interventions for various human disorders. However, due to the lack of a reliable high-throughput
screening technology to quantify nuclear lncRNA levels, human pathways of nuclear lncRNA biogenesis,
regulation, and surveillance have been refractory to forward genetic identification. We developed an approach
that enables the first successful forward genetic interrogation of the pathways of biogenesis and surveillance of
the nuclear lncRNA MALAT1 in human cells. We identified human nuclear complexes required for MALAT1 3′
end surveillance and components required for MALAT1-associated small cytoplasmic RNA (mascRNA)
maturation, as well as numerous candidate genes that require further investigation. We propose to expand this
approach and perform comprehensive forward genetic identification of human nuclear pathways acting on the
following lncRNAs: (i) cancer-associated lncRNA MALAT1, (ii) multiple endocrine neoplasia transcript 1 (MEN-
β), which is up-regulated upon embryonic stem cell and neuronal differentiation, and (iii) polyadenylated
nuclear lncRNA PAN, required for lytic production of new viral particles by the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV). This study is aimed to identify human pathways and regulatory networks acting on
nuclear lncRNAs and uncover new targets for potential anti-cancer and anti-viral therapies."

 CRISPR offers the promise of total control over genes in model organisms, such as the nematode
C. elegans. To make this a reality, we need functional tags on all proteins that we can use as handles to
influence the biology of any cell. However, each individual edit requires unique reagents and takes experienced
worm geneticists 6 weeks or more to create. To edit many genes with diverse tags one gene at a time is just
not practical. The goals of this project are to make CRISPR genome modifications simple, inexpensive and
with increased throughput. We propose a series of multiplexed genome engineering methods that will
accelerate gene tagging in C. elegans 10- to 100-fold. First, we propose to optimize cassette exchange
methods using diverse recombinases that will allow geneticists to alter one gene with many diverse tags.
Second, we propose to develop a multiplexed CRISPR strategy that will allow groups to modify many genes
within a single editing experiment. Third, we will develop software and reagent libraries required to modify all
genes in the genome.
 • Aim 1. One gene: recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. We will characterize the germline activity
of a diverse set of recombinases and develop cassette exchange methods for rapidly integrating transgenes
or tags anywhere in the genome.
 • Aim 2. Many genes: multiplex CRISPR. Current methods require a unique injection cocktail for each
unique gene modification. We will develop a multiplex CRISPR strategy in which the reagents for tagging many
unique genes are injected simultaneously to generate many edited worm strains, each with a single edited
target.
 • Aim 3. All genes: software and molecular reagents. To tag the proteome, reagents cannot be efficiently
designed one-at-a-time, by hand. We will write software that identifies optimal tagging locations and designs
the required reagents, and we will build build a cost-effective pooled molecular workflow to build genome editing
reagents.
 C. elegans shares most of the genes mutated in human genetic diseases; as a simple, compact and rapidly
developing animal, it is an attractive platform to study these genes. In the future, the genome engineering
pipelines developed here could be used to insert a swappable tagging site in every protein-coding gene in the
C. elegans genome, making it possible to easily add any tag to any gene. Such a strain collection would be a
boon for cell biologists and geneticists, enabling new inroads in studying how cells work and how to fix them
when disease processes cause them to malfunction."
10772041,"Thanks to the Simons Simplex Collection, the scientific community possesses dozens of highly reliable risk
genes through the identification of rare de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). What
is currently missing is a mechanism linking these genes into a convergent pathway that gives insight into disease
etiology. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that ANK2 and SCN2A, two of the top genes implicated in
ASD, are linked at the molecular level to control dendritic excitability. NaV1.2, product of the SCN2A gene, is a
voltage-gated sodium channel found primarily in pyramidal neurons where it localizes to the axon initial segment
(AIS) early in development. Later in development, NaV1.2 relocalizes to dendrites where it plays critical roles in
synaptic plasticity and stability. The timing of the subcellular relocalization of NaV1.2 away from the AIS (~ 1 year
in humans) also correlates with the onset of symptoms in ASD patients, suggesting that understanding the new
role for NaV1.2 in dendrites may be critical for determining the etiology of SCN2A-associated ASD. While our
group and others have shown that the intracellular scaffolding protein, ankyrin-G (ANK3), is necessary for NaV1.2
localization to the AIS, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying the dendritic localization of NaV1.2.
Ankyrin-B, product of the ANK2 gene, is a member of the ankyrin gene family that shares significant homology
with ankyrin-G, yet it is localized at high levels to dendrites where it may play a key role in NaV1.2 dendritic
localization. Testing the hypothesis that ANK2 and SCN2A are linked at the molecular level to control dendritic
excitability will have a positive impact by increasing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying synaptic
alterations in ASD, which may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention."
10807969,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this proposal we will define molecular and cellular mechanisms of different combinations of known adjuvant
components MPLA (a TL4 agonist), CpG (a TLR9 agonist), agonists of cGAS-STING and NOD1/2 pathways,
and a squalene-in-water emulsion (AddaVAX™). Our overall Aim is to provide a detailed analysis of every
combination of these using high throughput in vitro and in vivo assays, followed an in-depth analysis of two
combination adjuvants using live cell imaging and single-cell mRNA sequencing of draining lymph nodes after
vaccination.
Initially, 96-well based in vitro assays of innate and adaptive immune system activation will be used to profile
different adjuvants components, both individually, and in different combinations and concentrations. These
assays will comprise: 1) activation of TLR, NOD and STING signaling pathways using primary dendritic cells
(DCs), T and B cells from reporter transgenic mice; 2) in vitro activation of naïve B cells to monitor their
differentiation into plasma cells and class switching. We anticipate some of the adjuvant combinations will have
synergistic effects that differ from the sum of the effects when used individually. Next, based on performance in
vitro a subset of combination adjuvants and their individual components will be evaluated as adjuvants for model
vaccine antigens (influenza hemagglutinin H1, filovirus (EBOV) glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 spike) in vivo in
mice. Immunogenicity metrics will comprise: 1) antibody dynamics and durability, isotype, avidity and breadth of
cross-reactivity using protein microarrays; 2) flow cytometry of antigen-specific B cells to assess differentiation
and cross-reactivity; 3) T cell recall assays to define Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profiles; 4) neutralization by sera of
live influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein. This will provide a comprehensive
cellular and molecular profile associated with each combination adjuvant.
Two combination adjuvants (and their individual components for comparison) will be selected for a deep analysis
using: 1) transgenic mice that allow Ca2+ fluxes in live CD4 T and B cells and DCs to be visualized using 2-
photon microscopy. Combined with techniques of whole tissue imaging, we will monitor adjuvant-driven T cell
and DC mobilization, motility and interactions in live draining lymph nodes; 2) using single-cell RNAseq
technology (10x Genomics Inc) of cells in draining lymph nodes, we will define cell composition and phenotype,
cellular interactions and spatial organization. We will perform a deep analysis in Year 1 on the combination
adjuvant CpG/MPLA + AddaVAX (TLR9 and TLR4 agonists in a squalene-in-water emulsion) since we have
already shown this is a powerful combination adjuvant. A second combination adjuvant will be selected for deep
analysis based on data generated in the in vitro and in vivo assays described herein. Together these
complementary deep approaches will provide an unprecedented level of molecular and cellular detail of two
highly effective combination adjuvants. Overall, we anticipate these data will help guide the future design of
vaccines where the immune response required can be tuned according to the particular pathogen in question."

 There are an estimated 1 million adults currently living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States.
Based on the unique and progressive nature of MS, up to one third of the MS population requires full or part-
time use of a wheelchair. Exercise training is identified as a safe, effective second-line therapy for aiding in MS
symptom management, however wheelchair users with MS have been excluded from the majority of research
investigating the efficacy and promotion of exercise in MS. Wheelchair users with MS are unique from
wheelchair users with other chronic disabling conditions such as spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy (e.g.,
immune system dysfunction and variable disease course), and warrant focal applications of exercise training
that suit disease-specific needs and preferences. Novel exercise training programs for wheelchair users with
MS would potentially reduce long-term medical costs through improved symptoms, body composition, and
overall health (i.e., reduced comorbid conditions). The overarching goal of the proposed research is to obtain
feasibility and initial efficacy data for delivering a stakeholder-informed, home-based, remotely-supported and
supervised exercise training program among wheelchair users with MS.
 Our research team initiated a three-step community-engaged research agenda that provided a
foundation for the proposed research. First, semi-structured interviews with wheelchair users with MS
regarding preferences for exercise training provided a foundation indicating the need for structured, home-
based exercise training. Next, we recruited a community advisory board to advise the research team in
creating a wheelchair exercise training program. Subsequently, focus group participants provided feedback
regarding the appropriateness of the proposed exercise training program materials and delivery to guide final
adaptations. This process yielded a novel exercise training program for wheelchair used with MS that will be
tested for feasibility and initial efficacy in the proposed study. Twenty-four wheelchair users with MS will be
recruited in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and randomized into exercise training or attention/contact control
wellness condition delivered over a 16-week period. The study will assess the feasibility (Specific Aim 1:
recruitment, retention, and safety), acceptability (Specific Aim 2: participant satisfaction and perceptions), and
scientific outcomes of interest (Specific Aim 3: metabolic health, MS symptoms, and exercise behavior
change). If successful, the proposed research will provide critical data for guiding a larger efficacy trial that may
substantially move the needle in rehabilitation research and practice for wheelchair users with MS given there
are no evidence-based physical activity guidelines for this segment of the MS population. The proposed
research is directly aligned with NIH Pathways to Prevention Workshop: Can Physical Activity Improve the
Health of Wheelchair Users? and the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research Center’s mission of
enhancing the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities."
10570549,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tobacco smoking is causally related to at least 12 cancer types. Quitting smoking after cancer is critical for
improved treatment outcomes; however, over two-thirds of smokers continue to smoke after a cancer
diagnosis. Smoking after cancer increases the risk of mortality and is associated with poorer cancer treatment
efficacy, treatment complications, development of second primary tumors, and cancer recurrence. Continued
smoking also places patients at greater risk of other non-cancer related health consequences (e.g.,
cardiovascular disease) and reduced quality of life. Thus, smoking cessation is extremely important for cancer
patients regardless of cancer type. However, our previous research demonstrated that patients with non-
smoking related cancers (e.g., breast) or with cancers that are not widely known to be smoking-related (e.g.,
bladder) report lower smoking cessation motivation and poorer cessation rates compared to patients with a
cancer for which smoking is a well-established risk factor (e.g., thoracic). Thus, the aim of my systematic
independent research line is to increase smoking cessation motivation, and ultimately enhance smoking
abstinence rates, among patients with cancers not typically linked to smoking. With NCI R03 funding, I
developed five brief booklets targeted by cancer type to increase motivation to quit smoking among patients
with cancers that are not smoking related (i.e., breast, melanoma) or not widely recognized as smoking related
(i.e., bladder, colorectal, gynecological). The proposed project continues the systematic development of this
intervention by piloting testing randomized controlled trial (RCT) procedures, and by assessing contextual
factors to inform its future implementation in oncology treatment settings. We will conduct two rigorous studies.
In Study I, we will randomize 100 patients with one of the aforementioned cancer diagnosis (20 per cancer site)
to receive usual care (brief advice + Quiltine EHR referral) vs. usual care plus our targeted self-help
intervention to examine the feasibility of RCT procedures (i.e., recruitment rates, randomization, adherence,
treatment fidelity, attrition, acceptability, and credibility) and to establish confidence intervals of estimated
efficacy of our intervention in increasing smoking cessation motivation compared to usual care.
Simultaneously, in Study II, using a sequential mixed-methods approach, we will collect quantitative and
qualitative data from clinic leaders and other stakeholders in the oncology setting (e.g., physicians, nurses,
tobacco treatment specialists) who could be involved in providing smoking cessation assistance to identify: (1)
intervention delivery modality and source; (2) potential barriers and facilitators to implementation; (3)
recommended implementation strategies for seamless integration into routine care; and (4) current practice
patterns and organizational readiness for change. This study, in coordination with the proposed training plan in
sophisticated study designs, implementation science, and complex data analysis will provide the necessary
preliminary data and expertise needed for a successful career as an independent investigator."

This NIH Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) proposal describes a five-
year training program for mentored career development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The principal
investigator, Dr. Michael Honigberg, is a staff cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), an
Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a prior trainee of the NHLBI-sponsored T32 training
grant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The primary goal of this award is for the candidate to obtain the
training and skills necessary to become a successful independent physician-scientist. His long-term career
goal is to use multi-omics approaches to elucidate disease mechanisms and discover novel targets for the
prevention and treatment of heart disease, with a focus on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women.
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) refers to the expansion of blood stem cells harboring
acquired mutations in leukemia-associated genes. CHIP predisposes to accelerated atherosclerosis. In Dr.
Honigberg’s preliminary work, he showed that women with a history of premature menopause are enriched for
CHIP by 1.4-fold and that CHIP is independently associated with incident CVD in postmenopausal women. He
now proposes to test the hypothesis that CHIP is a key mediator of accelerated CVD in women with premature
age of menopause using multiple complementary approaches. In Aim 1, he will associate age at menopause
with expansion of CHIP clones over time and incident CVD in cohorts with serial next-generation sequencing.
In Aim 2, he will use large proteomic datasets to discover and validate novel protein biomarkers of CHIP and
test the role of these proteins in premature menopause-associated CVD. In Aim 3, he will use machine
learning approaches to train, validate, and test a CHIP risk classifier to guide CHIP screening in women.
The proposed training plan involves primary mentorship from Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, an expert in genomics
and atherosclerotic CVD prevention, and co-mentorship from Dr. JoAnn Manson, principal investigator of the
Women’s Health Initiative and an expert in menopause, sex hormones, and CVD in women. Both mentors are
enthusiastic about supporting Dr. Honigberg’s career development. The training plan additionally involves a
distinguished Scientific Advisory Committee including experts in proteomics and multi-omics investigation (Dr.
Robert Gerszten, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center), clonal hematopoiesis and myeloid malignancy (Dr.
Benjamin Ebert, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), inflammation and vascular biology (Dr. Peter Libby, Brigham
and Women’s Hospital), and machine learning (Dr. Puneet Batra, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard). The
candidate will leverage coursework, facilities, and resources from across MGH, Harvard University, MIT, and
the Broad Institute toward completion of his proposed training and research plan. Dr. Honigberg’s structured
training plan will develop the skills necessary to pursue a research program distinct from that of his mentors
and will facilitate his transition to an independent, R01-funded physician-scientist."
10791822,"The goal of this project is to elucidate a new mechanism for compensatory hepatocyte proliferation
under stress. Liver regeneration in mammals has been extensively interrogated, although it is unclear how
hepatocytes with proliferative signaling defect strive to proliferate in response to hepatic damages. To
address this question, we investigated cellular dynamics in regenerating livers with hepatocyte-specific
deletion of Shp2, a signal transmitter of receptor tyrosine kinases. Following partial hepatectomy (PHx), a
few Shp2-deficient hepatocytes grouped together, and proliferated in colony-like structures. These
proliferating hepatocytes in colonies were characterized by high levels of CD133 expression but lack of other
progenitor cell markers such as EpCAM, Sox9 or AFP. The CD133+ hepatocytes apparently communicated
via tight cell-cell contact and CD133+ vesicles. The hepatocyte clusters emerged transiently in Shp2-deficient
livers following PHx and disappeared quickly after completion of liver regeneration.
 CD133 has been known as a biomarker for stem/progenitor cells and also as a physical marker for
cancer stem cells (CSCs), although its function and mechanism are poorly understood. Based on the
preliminary results, we hypothesize that CD133-mediated intercellular communication is an inherent function
with which cells strive to proliferate under proliferative signaling deficit, given that cells strive to survive via
the process of autophagy under nutritional deficit. To test this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims.
Aim 1 is to characterize the distinctive CD133+ hepatocyte proliferation pattern in livers deficient for different
proliferative signaling molecules. Aim 2 is to determine the functional requirement of CD133 and CD133+
vesicles for compensatory hepatocyte proliferation. Aim 3 is to investigate this compensatory cell proliferation
mechanism in drug resistance of cancer cells. Success of this project will elucidate a long-sought mechanism
of CD133 function in normal and cancer cell proliferation under stress, independent of stemness, which we
discovered unexpectedly in preliminary experiments."

Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient
care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can
overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds,
for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk
factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is
a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a
complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults,
and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of
consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and
providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for
consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain
activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients
without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also
showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is
still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating
symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers
preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and
can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to
infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability.
Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously
evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy
reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with
latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven
simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these
methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to
uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work
turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength,
and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions."

evidence-based behavioral treatments that address the depressive symptoms in cancer remains
underdeveloped and poorly implemented.
We
will
evaluate the effectiveness and the implementation of an
evidence-based HIT behavioral treatment for cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms. This HIT
treatment combines systematic, electronic health record-integrated screening for depressive symptoms with an
individually-tailored HIT interventions to address gaps in the treatment of depression among cancer patients.
The study takes place across two distinct health systems in two major metropolitan areas—Chicago and Miami
(Northwestern Medicine and University of Miami Health System). We aim to conduct a pragmatic Type I
effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial of My Cancer Support—an evidence-based, tailored behavioral HIT
program for the management of elevated depressive symptoms—in ambulatory oncology care settings within
two large health systems. We will establish the effectiveness of My Cancer Support on depressive
symptoms(i.e., primary outcome) and anxiety, HRQoL, and health services use (i.e. secondary outcomes)
compared to usual care. We will evaluate the process of implementing My Cancer Support and its impact on
patient and system-level outcomes, including reach, adoption, maintenance, and acceptability. Next, we will
identify facilitators and barriers to wide-scale implementation of My Cancer Support beyond Northwestern
Medicine and University of Miami Health System. Finally, we will explore whether the effects of My Cancer
Support vary across SES, language, disease severity, severity of depressive symptoms, recruitment sites, and
other patient and clinical characteristics."
10757709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Headache affects more than 39 million Americans, yet a full understanding of the cellular and molecular
pathology underlying headache has not been achieved; the discovery of novel, clinically useful therapeutics is
therefore limited. This proposal will use complimentary techniques to 1) understand the mechanistic
contributions of endocannabinoid system (ECBS) dysregulation to headache pathology and 2) validate a
therapeutic strategy that enhances eCB tone to offer an improved option over current therapeutics. Studies will
use two rat models of headache, cortical spreading depression (CSD) and medication-overuse (MOH) in male
and female rats to define the cellular and molecular role played by the ECBS in headache.
 Recent clinical observations support the idea of Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency (CED) as a potential
mechanism of migraine in some patients; however, studies providing evidence for a mechanistic role of eCBs in
migraine are limited. Preliminary data suggest that both cortical KCl and medication overuse deplete 2AG and
increase inflammation in the PAG, a midbrain region implicated in descending pain modulation. Further,
headache symptomology could be induced by pharmacological depletion of 2AG in more female than male rats
further supporting loss of eCB tone in headache in a sex-selective manner. These exciting findings led to the
hypothesis that headache pain results from sex-dependent enhanced degradation of 2AG in the PAG by
ABHD6 and MAGL leading to increased inflammation and loss of descending inhibition that drive pain
behaviors. Three Aims will define the role of ABHD6 as the “gatekeeper” of 2AG availability for retrograde
release (Aim1); determine the role of MAGL in terminating 2-AG actions during headache which may contribute
to maintenance (Aim 2); and establish how ECBS dysregulation within the PAG occurs in males and females at
the molecular and cellular levels during induction, maintenance, and recovery from headache like pain (Aim 3).
Integration of these results between aims will clearly delineate the role of 2-AG within the PAG plays a role in
headache induction and maintenance and validate increasing eCB tone by targeting either MAGL and/or ABHD6
as unique new targets for migraine therapy. Successful completion of this project will provide foundational
rationale to initiate a drug discovery program selectively targeting the ECBS for migraine intervention to provide
a better clinical option against headache as compared to current therapeutics."

Hypertension rates among middle-aged non-Hispanic black (NHB) adults are among the highest in the world,
which is a significant source of racial disparities in ADRD. In September 2020, two NIH directors recommended
safety-net health care providers and patients and scientists co-design novel interventions to alleviate racial and
socioeconomic disparities in hypertension. Also in 2020, the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention noted
that lifestyle interventions may be particularly efficacious for ADRD prevention in subpopulations with high
cardiovascular disease risk. This evidence points to a significant need for behavioral intervention co-design
with subpopulations at high cardiovascular risk.
Thus, we worked with safety-net primary care providers and NHB patients to iteratively co-design an
intervention to support hypertension self-management and Mediterranean-Dash Intervention for
Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet and aerobic training (MAT). Due to the co-design process, MAT
addresses patient and safety-net provider preferences and thus may be an engaging and sustainable strategy
in an externally valid setting for the promotion of MIND diet and aerobic activity in a very high-risk
subpopulation. MAT is also likely to be potent as over 50% of CVD among NHB adults has been attributed to
poor diet and fitness, which contribute greatly to ADRD disparities.
MAT involves our CDC-endorsed hypertension self-management education and support classes followed by
home-delivered MIND food ingredients and twice-weekly MIND cooking, nutrition, and aerobic activity via
videoconference. This novel intervention has not been evaluated for its effects on cognition. In an early stage
randomized controlled trial, we aim to demonstrate feasibility and investigate MAT effects on cognition.
We propose to test, in a Stage IB pilot RCT, MAT versus our attention control intervention (AC). We will
randomize 128 NHB safety-net primary care patients with high systolic blood pressure (≥140 mm Hg) to 28wks
of AC or MAT. Provider-led MAT is 28wks followed by 24wks of self-led MAT. Measures will be at baseline,
post-treatment (28 weeks), and follow-up (52 weeks). We will measure feasibility and cognition. We will also
explore intervention processes and obtain and store blood samples for possible future analyses. A successful
pilot would support a follow-on ADRD prevention trial across safety-net primary care sites with the objectives of
ADRD prevention and reduction of ADRD disparities."

Oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos), a mitochondrial energy generation process, promotes chemotherapeutic
resistance in breast and other cancers. In fact, transplantation of mitochondria from tumorigenic cells into non-
tumorigenic cells demonstrated these organelles are necessary and sufficient for aggressive phenotypes of triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Nearly 50% of TNBC patients treated with neoadjuvant (pre-surgical)
chemotherapy (NACT; combined anthracyclines, platinums, and/or taxanes) will harbor substantial residual
tumor burden, leading to extremely high risk of recurrence and death4. There are no approved targeted therapies
for neoadjuvant treatment of non-BRCA-mutant TNBC. Thus, there is an urgent need to find ways to eradicate
residual tumor cells. Furthermore, the mechanisms driving metabolic reprogramming in chemoresistant TNBC
are unclear. Our comparisons of serial pre- and post-NACT patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and human TNBC
biopsies revealed heightened oxphos signatures in residual tumor cells, and we demonstrated oxphos is a
unique therapeutic vulnerability of residual TNBC. We observe significantly higher protein levels of the
mitochondrial fusion-driving GTPase optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) in post- vs. pre-NACT TNBC biopsies. Furthermore,
high expression of mitochondrial fusion-driving proteins in breast cancer is associated with poor survival. The
impact of mitochondrial structure, dictated by the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion, on metabolism
varies highly across tumor types. Despite the importance of mitochondria to metabolism, no studies have
addressed how mitochondrial structure impacts metabolic states driving TNBC therapeutic responses. Our
preliminary data provide evidence that NACT increases mitochondrial fusion and metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
We can increase oxphos and NACT resistance in TNBC cells by genetically or pharmacologically perturbing
mitochondrial fission with Mdivi-1, a Drp1 inhibitor. Conversely, perturbation of mitochondrial fusion with
MYLS22, an OPA1 inhibitor, decreased oxphos and NACT resistance. We hypothesize OPA1-driven
mitochondrial fusion mediates an NACT-induced metabolic switch to promote chemoresistance in TNBC cells.
To address this, our specific aims are to: 1) Determine if mitochondrial fusion is responsible for chemotherapy-
induced oxphos in TNBC, and 2) Target and quantify mitochondrial fusion in residual TNBC mouse models and
serial patient biopsies. These results will increase our mechanistic understanding of regulation of the
mitochondrial life, as well as mechanisms driving metabolic adaptations in TNBC. Furthermore, our findings will
provide additional metabolic therapeutic targets to overcome chemoresistance in residual TNBCs."
10757013,"Project Summary/Abstract: Iron is an essential metal, but high iron stores are toxic due to increased oxidative
stress produced by iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species. Increased iron stores are associated with well-
established risk factors of heart and liver failure, arthritis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, including obesity, metabolic
syndrome, and chronic inflammation, particularly for patients who are genetically susceptible to developing iron
overload. Secondary iron overload occurs in several anemias (e.g., thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome,
sickle cell anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia) due to repeated transfusions, and increased absorption of iron
loading from repeated transfusions can be major causes of morbidity and mortality in chronic anemia patients.
 There are three FDA-approved chelators in the U.S.: deferoxamine (Desferral, Novartis; IV/IM/SC injection),
deferasirox (Jadenu, Exjade; Novartis; oral tablet), and deferiprone (Ferriprox, ApoPharma; oral tablet/solution).
Since 1968, the prototype iron chelator deferoxamine has shown good therapeutic efficacy but requires repeated
injections or continuous infusions, which considerably decreases patient compliance. To overcome this issue,
two oral chelators have become available in the market (deferasirox in 2005 and deferiprone in 2011). Despite
their efficient iron chelation with improved patient compliance, oral chelators have shown significant dose-limiting
adverse effects. For example, deferasirox can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be fatal in elderly
patients, in addition to hepatic and renal toxicities. These adverse effects occur because these small molecule
chelators demonstrate a higher tendency to distribute into non-target tissues, exerting toxicities. Furthermore,
clinicians report that a novel, more convenient, and better-tolerated delivery of the iron chelator would improve
treatment adherence and long-term therapeutic outcomes.
 Previously, we have successfully developed a multifunctional nanochelator that captures iron from plasma
and liver, circulates without significant nonspecific uptake in non-target tissues, and leaves the body through
urinary excretion. Armed with this renal clearable nanochelator, we aim to develop subcutaneous injectable
hydrogel formulations with increased exposure for up to 3 weeks and with tracking the release kinetics using
multimodal imaging systems longitudinally. This strategy can decrease the iron burden and reduce the risk of
iron-mediated organ toxicity, with no overt chelator-related adverse effects. Therefore, our hypothesis is that a
thermosensitive injectable hydrogel, which offers a long-term sustained release of iron chelators but a short-term
residence in the major tissues/organs (i.e., rapid clearance upon iron chelation without accumulation), can
improve the therapeutic efficacy of iron chelation while minimizing chelator-induced toxicity, beyond the current
standard treatment of iron overload."
10741797,"Despite decades of research, no effective therapies exist to circumvent the irreversible alterations in
lung function associated with COPD. Further, complications of COPD arise from acute and chronic
exacerbations that amplify ongoing injury and remodeling that increase morbidity and mortality. The
pathophysiology of exacerbations is poorly understood, but is primarily due to inflammation from infections.
Some patients are more susceptible to exacerbations and represent an `exacerbator phenotype' associated
with COPD-dependent changes in innate and adaptive immunity. Natural killer (NK) cells are a
heterogeneous population of lymphocytes that are important in the defense against infections. They are also
involved in initiating and directing active immune responses through cytokine production. NK cells recognize
pathogen-infected cells expressing ligands for an array of activating and inhibitory receptors. Research by
our lab and others identified multiple effects of smoking on NK cell function that suggest these changes are
significant in the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbations. Traditionally, NK cells were divided into immature
and mature subpopulations based on CD16 and CD56 expression. Recently, high-dimensional analysis of
NK cells revealed a surprisingly high degree of phenotypic diversity and that each individual has thousands
of unique populations of NK cells. Although the expression of various NK cell surface markers provides clues
about the function of subpopulations, the significance of each populations is unknown. Therefore, we probed
NK cell phenotypes from a cohort of non-smokers, smokers, and COPD patients targeting NK cell activating
and inhibitory receptors. These studies revealed several unique NK cell populations that differed between
groups. Further analyses showed that the size of NK cell subsets associated with a previous exacerbation
with 95% confidence. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that smoking alters NK cell heterogeneity
which leads to the emergence of unique populations that can serve as biomarkers of increased risk of COPD
exacerbations. We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define the natural history
of NK cell diversity and plasticity in never smokers and smokers. Previous analyses of NK cell populations
over time are based on limited phenotyping and high-dimensional analyses of NK cell populations have been
derived from a single time point. To advance our understanding of the heterogeneity of NK cell populations
over time, we will conduct a 3-year prospective longitudinal analysis of NK cell plasticity in never smokers
and current smokers without COPD. Aim 2. Define whether alterations in NK cell populations precede or
occur following exacerbations in COPD to determine the usefulness of NK cell phenotyping as a biomarker
of future exacerbations. Preliminary data identify alterations in NK cell subsets associated with COPD
exacerbations. However, we do not know if these alterations precede and predict future COPD exacerbations
or if they arise as a consequence of exacerbations. Further, if COPD exacerbations trigger changes in NK
cell populations, it is not known if these derangements persist finitely or indefinitely. Aim 3. Define the
functional significance of unique NK cell populations associated with COPD exacerbations. We show that
only 15-30% of bulk NK cells respond to cytokine stimulation to elaborate proinflammatory cytokines. This
indicates that a specific subpopulation(s) is uniquely capable of generating a response. NK cells have
obvious importance in immune homeostasis. Therefore, future treatment options for COPD exacerbations
require a balanced approach reflecting the need to preserve/restore necessary effector functions without
disarming or overstimulating the entirety of the NK cells. This Aim will provide a critical advance in our
understanding of the functional heterogeneity of NK cells in COPD and reveal insight into the significance of
the NK cell subpopulations associated with COPD exacerbations."
10857358,"Project Summary/Abstract
Increasing sample size is a tremendously important factor in building our understanding of the genetics of
human disease. As we discover that more and more diseases have a complex web of genetic causation, we
need larger and larger genetic datasets to disentangle them, and to ultimately produce successful therapies.
Driven in part by this need, the community is now assembling vast collections of human genome sequences,
and millions of samples will soon be commonplace. There is a profound problem, however: our computational
methods for storing, processing, and analyzing genomic data are lagging far behind. The algorithms and data
structures underlying today’s computational methods were designed for thousands of samples, not millions.
Without fundamental change in how we store and process genomic data, we will either not fully tap the
potential of the data we collect, or the computational costs will be astronomical – or both.
 Nonhuman datasets, with applications in epidemiology, ecology, evolution, and agriculture, may not reach
these sample sizes soon, but here we nevertheless face a related barrier. Simulation is increasingly important
for tasks from hypothesis generation to parameter inference. However, current simulation methods only scale
to tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals, inappropriate for many species of interest (e.g., mosquitos).
This is crucial, since evolution and ecology in large populations differs from small ones, in ways that cannot
be avoided by mathematical tricks (like rescaling).
 Our proposal addresses these critical needs by focusing on a new data structure: the “tree sequence”,
which encodes genetic variation data using the population genetics processes that produced the data itself,
by representing variation among contemporary samples using the underlying genealogical trees. This yields
extraordinary levels of data compression, with file sizes hundreds of times smaller than current community
standards. Since the tree sequence was introduced in 2016 it has led to performance increases of 2–4 orders
of magnitude in genome simulation, calculation of statistics, and ancestry inference. Such sudden leaps in
computational performance are vanishingly rare, and only possible through deep algorithmic advances.
 Our research plan builds on the extraordinary successes of tree sequence methods so far, scaling up three
crucial layers of computational genomics: analysis, simulation, and inference. First, we will continue our
development of highly efficient tree-sequence-based methods for fundamental operations in statistical and
population genetics. Second, we will scale up genome simulations by integrating tree sequence methods
into complex forward-time simulations and utilizing modern, multicore processors. Third, we will combine
efficient simulations and the rich information contained in the tree sequence with cutting-edge deep-learning
techniques to develop new inference methods. Together, we aim to revolutionize the way we work with and
learn from population genetic variation data."
10854898,"Abstract (30 line):
The overarching goal of this R01 renewal is to advance our understanding of the impact that LKB1 inactivation
has on mitochondrial bioenergetics, metabolism and therapy response in lung cancer. To accomplish this we
will perform a structural and functional study of mitochondrial heterogeneity following LKB1 inactivation in lung
adenocarcinomas (LUADs). Inactivating mutations of the LKB1 tumor suppressor gene frequently occur in
LUADs. LKB1 functions as a master kinase that regulates cellular energetics and mitochondrial function
through activation of adenosine monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK). As such, LKB1 mutations (LKB1-/-)
result in severe defects in the cellular energetics and mitochondrial homeostasis of lung tumors, characterized
by atypical mitochondria of varying size, morphology, and function. However, there remains a gap in our
knowledge at a physiological and mechanistic level of how LKB1 inactivation disregulates mitochondrial
structure and function in LUAD. To address this gap, we functionally imaged mitochondrial activity in LUADs
utilizing the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl-triphenylphosphonium
(18FBnTP) and found that 18FBnTP is an in vivo biomarker of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Expanding upon this,
we performed 3-dimensional scanning blockface electron microscopy (3D SBEM) on lung tumors to map
mitochondrial structure in vivo. As a direct result of our analysis of mitochondrial networks within LKB1+/+ and
LKB1-/- mouse models of lung cancer we discovered the existence of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations.
Each mitochondrial subpopulation carries with it a unique set of bioenergetic activities and sensitivities to
apoptosis. Importantly, loss of LKB1 directly alters the structural landscape of mitochondrial subpopulations
thus altering the functional, metabolic landscape of the tumor. We hypothesize that LKB1 loss induces
remodeling and spatial reorganization of mitochondria subpopulations in lung tumors leading to disregulation of
OXPHOS and cell survival pathways. To test this hypothesis we will utilize PET imaging in combination with 3-
dimensional scanning blockface electron microscopy (3D SBEM) and respirometry to study mitochondrial
heterogeneity LKB1 mutant LUADs. In Aim 1 we will investigate the mTORC1-Drp1 axis as a regulator of
mitochondrial fission and cristae remodeling following inactivation of LKB1 in lung tumors. In Aim 2 we will
investigate the LKB1/AMPK pathway as a novel regulator of peridroplet mitochondria and fatty acid oxidation in
lung cancer. In Aim 3 we will test novel PTPMT1 inhibitors as chemosensitizing agents to overcome therapy
resistant LKB1 mutant LUADs. The proposed studies hold promise to advance our fundamental understanding
of mitochondrial biology and the impact that mitochondrial heterogeneity has on promoting lung tumorigenesis.
The proposed work has relevance to human health in the areas of imaging based diagnosis and the
development of new therapies to improve the treatment and outcomes of lung cancer patients."

The goal of this new T32 post-doctoral training grant is to prepare the next generation of exceptional surgeon-
scientists to tackle the most pressing scientific questions in adult and pediatric cardiovascular diseases. Given
the decline in the number of cardiovascular surgeons conducting research, there is a critical need to provide
foundational research training for aspiring cardiothoracic surgeon-scientists to: (1) advance the rigor and
specialty-specific context of cardiac surgical research and policy and (2) establish thought leaders who positively
advance clinical care and outcomes within cardiac surgery. The goal of the Surgeon Scientist Training in Cardiac
Diseases (SSTCD) is to provide cardiac surgery residents with training in basic, translational, and clinical/health
services research to foster their development into independent surgeon-scientists.
 The University of Michigan (UM) is uniquely positioned to train promising surgeon-scientists in adult and
pediatric cardiovascular disease research given its extramurally funded cardiac surgery basic, translational, and
clinical/health services research laboratories; Frankel Cardiovascular Center and Congenital Heart Center; and
Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation. The SSTCD’s Director (Dr. Chen) and the two Associate-Directors
(Drs. Ailawadi and Likosky) have ongoing funded laboratories examining various aspects of cardiovascular
disease-related conditions across this translational research continuum. We will recruit surgeon-scientist
trainees in the midst of their clinical residency, with each trainee choosing between a basic/translational research
track or a clinical/ health services research track that meets their interests and training needs. Program oversight
will be provided by a Steering Committee (for overall program function), individual trainee Mentoring Committees
(similar to a thesis committee), and an Internal and External Advisory Board. The Program is composed of four
areas: (1) A Mentor-Guided Research Experience - trainees will work on a broad range of basic/translational or
clinical/health services research topics in a collaborative atmosphere; (2) Didactic Training – trainees will learn
life and leadership skills, responsible conduct of research, epidemiology, and cardiovascular biology; (3)
Academic Productivity – trainees will put their training into practice by participating in research seminar series,
presentations at monthly research-in-progress series, an annual departmental “Resident Research Day”,
presentations at national conferences, and peer-reviewed publications and; (4) Program Evaluation – our multi-
faceted approach will ensure that our program meets the evolving needs of future trainees. We expect our new
training program will lead to a cadre of exceptionally trained young surgeon-scientists who will pursue cutting-
edge research to become mentors and leaders in the field."
10819584,"SUMMARY: Our understanding of the mechanisms used by the host immune system to fight growing tumors
has increased exponentially in recent decades, ushering in the development of new therapeutic approaches
such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) that have revolutionized cancer treatment. Despite these
advances, many patients fail to respond to even the most promising immunotherapies. Thus, there persists an
urgent need to identify the host factors responsible for the limited efficacy of these otherwise potent
immunotherapies in cancer patients. Not surprisingly, identifying mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance is
an active area of research. However, the vast majority of pre-clinical and clinical studies in this area do not
take into account the effects of common patient co-morbidities like obesity. This is notable because it is
estimated that by 2050 half of all adults in the U.S. will have obesity (defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI)
of >30 kg/m2). Studies focused on understanding the impact of obesity on anti-tumor immunity and cancer
immunotherapy outcomes have grown dramatically in number. However, the field still lacks a clear
understanding of when obesity is beneficial for cancer patients, when it is not, and why. Renal cancer is
one of 13 tumor types whose prevalence is increased by obesity. Multiple independent studies have found that
even in advanced renal cancer patients, 50-60% display BMI-defined overweight or obesity at ICB treatment
initiation. Thus, identifying the biological drivers of obesity-associated ICB resistance versus susceptibility in
renal cancer is a critically important area of research that could directly impact the majority of patients battling
this disease. We have been studying ICB resistance in the context of host obesity. We retrospectively
examined outcomes in a cohort of renal cancer patients who received standard of care anti-PD-1. In patients
with BMI-defined obesity at treatment initiation, 67% exhibited cancer progression at 12 months, whereas the
remaining 33% were progression-free, illustrating the highly variable effects of host obesity on patient
outcomes. This trend was reflected in our pre-clinical model of orthotopic renal cancer, in which we found that
host obesity is linked to cancer progression in 56% of mice that received an anti-PD-1-based combinatorial
immunotherapy. Here we will combine pre-clinical murine and prospective human subject studies to test the
hypothesis that sustained high levels of IL-1b inflammation during ICB therapy are associated with poor
outcomes in renal cancer patients who have obesity. We further predict that blockade of intratumoral IL-1b will
result in a favorable remodeling of the renal TME and improve ICB outcomes. Our findings will permit a
more nuanced understanding of the obesity-associated mediators of ICB resistance in renal cancer
patients, thereby: 1) providing new metrics to use for identifying patients who are less likely to respond to ICB
and 2) facilitating the development of new therapeutic and clinical management strategies for patients with
RCC or other solid tumors that are treated with ICB therapeutics."
10872125,"Abstract PFAS are a class of man-made organofluorine compounds whose presence in the environment is an
emerging, worldwide public health concern and a priority in environmental and human health research. Many
PFAS are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative, and have long half-lives in humans. Of particular concern
is that environmental exposure to PFAS may increase the risk of kidney cancer, whose incidence has shown
unexplained sustained and rapid increases in the US during the past decades. Several lines of emerging
evidence strongly support that PFAS exposures may increase the risk of kidney cancer among humans: First,
the kidney is a target organ of PFAS, which cause serious damage to the kidney at the levels commonly
experienced by US population; Second, PFAS exposures have been associated with kidney damage that is
known to increase kidney cancer risk; Third, a recent population-based case-control study of 324 RCC cases
and 324 controls from NCI supports the findings of early occupational mortality studies that PFAS exposure
increases kidney cancer risk. Much larger prospective studies of diverse, non-occupationally exposed
populations are urgently needed to either confirm or refute these preliminary findings.
Here, we propose a prospective nested case-control study to test the association between PFAS exposure and
renal cell carcinoma (RCC, more than 85% of all cases of kidney cancer). We will utilize the extensive resources
from five large and well-characterized US prospective cohorts: The Southern Community Cohort Study;
Hispanic
Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Cohort;
Nurses’ Health Study; Health Professionals Follow-Up Study;
and Physicians' Health Study. We will measure pre-diagnostic plasma levels of 40 PFAS from ~650 incident
RCC cases and their individually matched controls (~1,300 controls in 1:2 ratio). Specifically, we will examine
the following hypotheses: 1. Environmental exposure to PFAS increases the risk of RCC. In particular,
environmental exposure to PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS increases RCC risk; 2. Risk of RCC associated with
environmental PFAS exposure varies by mixture patterns, and varies by PFAS chemical structure,
branched vs linear isomers, and short vs. long chain length; and 3. Established baseline risk factors of
RCC (hypertension, obesity, diabetes and smoking) moderate the relationship between PFAS exposure
and risk of RCC. In exploratory aims, we will test if the risk of RCC associated with individual PFAS
exposures varies by histologic type of RCC or by race, and thus may contribute to racial disparities in
kidney cancer risk. This proposed study fills a critical knowledge gap and represents the first large prospective
cohort study to investigate the alleged association between PFAS exposure and kidney cancer risk in the US
among diverse cohorts of non-occupationally exposed individuals. The results of the study will inform the medical
and public health communities about the potential health effects of PFAS exposure and can help regulators make
sound, science-based decisions."
10775733,"Abstract
Human skin phototypes are routinely described in a gradient of 1 (redhaired) to 6 (dark constitutive pigment)
which correlates with UV sensitivity and risk of melanoma. Parallel to this gradient is the increase of nevi (moles)
from darker to lighter phototypes, a gradient which abruptly drops at phototype 1 (redhaired) where visible nevi
are unexpectedly rare. We hypothesized, and verified in murine models, that BRAFV600E- induced nevi in
redhaired mice are “invisible” but actually significantly more abundant compared to genetically matched black
mice. They are clinically inapparent due to lack of dark eumelanin, but are easily identified via fluorescence
tagging, and associated with profoundly elevated spontaneous melanoma transformation and UVA-induced
melanoma risk in redhaired mice. This melanoma risk was traced to red pigment because “albino-redhaired”
mice lack all pigment and are protected from either spontaneous (previously published), UVA-induced, or
peroxide-induced melanoma. Spontaneous and UVA-induced “invisible” nevi and melanoma-genesis are
proposed for study in Aims 1 and 2 for NRASQ61R pigment models, the 2nd most common human nevus and
melanoma oncogene, to complement our extensive unpublished data for BRAFV600E. Several small molecule
approaches will be tested to potentially mitigate pheomelanin-induced melanoma risk including induction of dark
eumelanin synthesis. One such example was already seen to ”reveal” visible lesions in the “invisible” nevus-
bearing redhaired mice. In addition, the fluorescent nevi, engineered into isogenic pigment backgrounds, will be
flow-sorted from skin and transcriptomically scrutinized to mechanistically dissect the pathways and genes
(including redox) that mediate the elevated melanoma risk among fair skinned individuals. Only a minority of
melanomas arise from pre-existing nevi, so we use our models to examine both nevi and overall melanoma risk.
We also discovered that the Parkinson’s Disease therapy L-Dopa significantly elevates pheomelanin synthesis
in redheads. Separate from being a dopamine precursor, L-Dopa is coincidentally a chemical intermediate in
melanin biosynthesis. Parkinson’s Disease and melanoma have long been associated with one another, but
lacking a mechanistic explanation. We observed that low dose L-Dopa significantly elevates melanoma risk in
BRAFV600E redhaired, but not in albino-red mouse models (which cannot make pheomelanin or eumelanin). Aim
3 will test L-Dopa’s melanoma causality in NRASQ61R redhaired models and whether topical skin darkening may
modify the enhanced melanoma risk already observed for BRAFV600E. Finally, Aim 4 will examine the hypothesis
that MITF regulates expression of an anti-oxidant pathway which includes enzymes controlling regeneration of
reduced NADPH and glutathione—key factors buffering melanocyte oxidative stress. One such enzyme, the
mitochondrial enzyme NNT, was recently shown to modulate melanocyte redox and melanosome differentiation.
We will test evidence that NNT is a transcriptional target of MITF and functionally scrutinize a newly identified
sequence variant in NNT, nominated by NCI collaborators as a candidate familial melanoma gene in humans."
10763385,"Cerebral aneurysms (CAs) are out-pouching dilations of cerebral arteries caused by local wall weakening and
maladaptive remodeling. Though rupture is relatively rare, the post-rupture survival rate is low, due to
complications such as vasospasm and stroke. Since the majority of cerebral aneurysms are stable, the ability to
predict rupture would both allow early intervention and eliminate unnecessary surgical procedures for stable
aneurysms. Many computational models have been developed with the aim of predicting rupture based on
correlation with clinically measurable factors, such as aneurysm shape or blood flow dynamics. But, these
models are not yet accurate enough for them to have been used in the clinic. A major shortcoming of the current
approach is that it does not consider the complex mechanics of rupture but instead tries to leap from shape
and/or fluid dynamics directly to rupture risk. In contrast, we will build on our understanding of mechanical
heterogeneity and its role in tissue growth, remodeling, and failure. By incorporating heterogeneity into the
description of the CA, we will inform future models and enable more accurate assessment of CA rupture risk.
We hypothesize that cerebral aneurysms are mechanically heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is predictive
of the rupture potential of the aneurysm. We further hypothesize that the material heterogeneity can be
determined from (i) the wall shear stress field caused by blood flow in the aneurysm and (ii) the geometry of
aneurysm, both of which can be determined in a clinical setting.
We propose a series of novel experiments and computational models aimed at elucidating the role of tissue
heterogeneity on cerebral aneurysm growth, remodeling, and rupture. Using freshly excised human aneurysm
tissue, we will measure regional tissue-scale mechanical properties, ECM structure and composition, cell
organization, and the rupture stress of the aneurysm. Next, we will develop and use computational models to
elucidate the biophysical mechanisms that connect tissue properties to aneurysm rupture. Finally, we will use
computational analyses of the architecture and blood flow mechanics within the aneurysm to connect these
clinically-measurable metrics to clinically non-measurable material properties. The findings from this study will
provide key mechanistic insights needed to advance cerebral aneurysm rupture prediction models."

vascularization and alveolarization. The endothelial cell (EC) molecular players that regulate normal and

an EC notch ligand, is required for lung vascularization and alveolarization. Specifically, DLL4 appears to
regulate the development of Car4+EC, a lung-specific EC subset that interacts with alveolar epithelial type I cells

decreased DLL4 expression and deviant lung vascularization. Testing a new therapy for BPD, we noted that

induced DLL4 repression in the mouse lung and in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC).
These data inform our hypothesis that EC-DLL4 regulates CAR4+ EC and AT1 development during distal lung
morphogenesis, and disruption of EC-DLL4 signaling in hyperoxia programs vascular and alveolar defects in
BPD. We will investigate this hypothesis by: 1) Testing whether EC-DLL4 regulation of CAR4+ EC is critical for
lung vascularization, 2) Defining the molecular pathways by which EC-DLL4 regulates AT1 development during
lung ontogeny, and 3) Determining whether repression of EC DLL4 signaling programs experimental and human
BPD. In Aim 1, we will study how EC-Dll4 deletion in sequential lung stages reprograms lung EC fate,
heterogeneity and the Car4+ EC population. Cell autonomous regulation of CAR4+ fate and angiogenesis by
DLL4 will be probed in primary and Dll4-deficient HPMEC lines we created. In Aim 2, we will study regulation of
AT1 development/function and alveolarization by EC DLL4. We will use single cell RNA sequencing to identify
the EC ligand - AT1 receptor interactions and AT1 molecular pathways disrupted with EC Dll4 deletion. We will
also study whether Dll4 loss disrupts EC angiocrine signaling through hepatocyte growth factor. In Aim 3, we will
combine molecular phenotyping of human BPD samples with studies in Dll4EC -/- vs. +/- vs. +/+ mice to determine EC-
Dll4’s role in disrupting EC fate, AT1 ontogeny and lung morphogenesis in HOX. The therapeutic mechanisms
by which ciclesonide rescues DLL4 signaling and lung injury in HOX will also be tested.
 Our proposal impacts the field by discovering DLL4’s role in lung EC fate specification and AT1 ontogeny
using innovative strategies. The significance lies in addressing critical barriers underpinning the vascular origins
of BPD and translational potential. In SA1 and SA2, we examine DLL4-regulation of Car4 EC and AT1 ontogeny
as critical mechanisms underpinning DLL4-regulation of lung development. In SA3, we study DLL4’s role in BPD,
and test the efficacy of ciclesonide to rescue DLL4 signaling and mitigate BPD in a pre-clinical model."
10757917,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are leading causes of age-related
cognitive impairment, currently untreatable. Increasing evidence indicates that functional
alterations of the cerebral microcirculation may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD by
reducing the cerebral blood supply. The health of the brain requires a continuous supply of O2
and nutrients through blood flow, tightly matched to its dynamic and regionally diverse energy
needs. Accordingly, neural activity increases blood flow in active brain regions (functional
hyperemia). Functional hyperemia depends in large part on the link between NMDA receptor
activity and neuronal production of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), and requires tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) for its full expression. The microtubule associated protein tau is a key
pathogenic factor in AD and other ADRD caused by tau mutations (tauopathies), but little is known
about its role in the neurovascular dysfunction associated in with AD/ADRD. Studies during the
previous funding period have discovered that tau disrupts the link between NMDA receptor activity
and NO production and suppresses functional hyperemia. Since, in tauopathies, including AD,
neocortical neural networks are hyperactive, the failure of functional hyperemia could be
particularly damaging by reducing the brain’s O2 supply in the face of the increased energy
demands caused by aberrant network activity. In this renewal application we seek to address this
critical issue by elucidating the neural and microvascular bases of the effects of p-tau on
neurovascular coupling and on neural network activity, and their impact on brain O2 delivery. To
this end, we will test the hypothesis that the neuronal NO deficit induced by p-tau disrupts the
microvascular bases of functional hyperemia and leads to neural network hyperactivity, which, in
turn, results in a potentially harmful reduction in brain O2. To this end, we will use advanced
imaging approaches in awake PS19 mice, a tauopathy model, to test the following hypotheses:
(a) The NO deficit induced by p-tau leads to aberrant neural network activity and disrupts the
orderly microvascular events underlying functional hyperemia; (b) The combination of aberrant
neural network activity and impaired functional hyperemia leads to reduced brain O2 availability,
rescuable by O2 supplementation; (c) Restoring neuronal NO production with tPA counteracts
neurovascular dysfunction, network hyperactivity, and reduced brain O2, and ameliorates tau
pathology and cognitive dysfunction. These studies will unveil a new aspect of p-tau pathobiology
related to a deleterious mismatch between O2 supply and demands, and may provide the
mechanistic bases for new therapies for AD and other tauopathies."
10929940,"Project Summary
Electronic health records contain a wealth of information about patient health status that can be mined for
multiple purposes, including clinical research and improved decision-making at the point of care. This
information can be represented as structured variables, unstructured text, and images, among other data
types. In this work, we develop new models for representing the unstructured text that take advantage of
powerful neural models called pre-trained transformers. We propose to make these models usable for much
longer texts by adding hierarchical layers to operate over summaries of smaller chunks of text, and shrinking
the size of the encoder that operates on smaller chunks. First, we develop a smaller encoder for sentence and
paragraph-sized texts, by using a technique called extreme distillation that trains smaller models from the
output of larger models. We also propose to pre-train hierarchical models for text, by taking advantage of
smaller encoders like that from the first aim. We take advantage of both public and private datasets and
experiment with different pre-training tasks and architectures. Our final aim proposes to combine
representations learned from text with those from the more mature areas of structured data and images. We
design experiments that answer the question of how best to merge these different information sources, and
apply them to important clinical classification use cases that are likely to require multiple information sources
for accurate performance. Specifically, we address the clinical tasks of predicting injury severity in emergency
departments, and predicting diagnosis and prognosis of patients in intensive care units."

The goal of this proposal will be to study the frequency, chronicity and etiology of post-acute sequelae of SARS
CoV-2 with protocols designed to characterize genetic and immuno-inflammatory factors that influence post-
COVID complications. We will establish a cohort of 1200 or more deeply phenotyped SARS CoV-2
patients in order to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection in distinct PASC cohorts. Patients
will be categorized by the presence or absence of pulmonary symptoms. We will focus on changes in pulmonary
lung function (DLCO and FVC, TLC) and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance at 3, 6, and 12 months and bi-
annually thereafter for 5 years. To assess for progressive pulmonary fibrosis we will include x-rays and
computerized tomography (CT) of the lung. To explore pathogenic mechanisms we will: 1) determine whether
specific cytokine levels associate with the severity or progression of PASC-associated disease; and, 2)
determine whether there is a characteristic autoantibody profile, including anti-cytokine antibodies, in PASC
patients; 3) perform Global Diversity Array (GDA) chip analysis on 1200 patients to develop an unbiased genetic
risk score for PASC; 4) determine whether specific genotypes: a) influence the severity or chronicity of PASC,
including the development of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis or b) contribute to the sustained immunological
responses in PASC patients. Finally, we will determine whether there is a genetic association with PASC
syndromes that varies across self-identified race/ethnicity (SIRE). Taken together, these novel studies are
intended to better understand pathogenetic mechanisms of disease, which can lead to the identification of
therapeutic targets and strategies for patients with post-acute sequelae."
10757912,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Regulation of gene expression at the level of translation allows cells and organisms to respond swiftly to
physiological stress and changing environments. Indeed, differential translation of capped, polyadenylated
mRNAs by eukaryotic ribosomes plays a critical role in biological processes vital for human health, including
normal cell growth, differentiation, development, learning and memory, and responses to physiological stress
including virus infection. Viral model systems have proven useful in elaborating cellular translational control
strategies because their replication is absolutely reliant upon virus mRNA translation by host ribosomes. Here,
we utilize a herpesvirus family member, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), to probe the complex circuitry
regulating mRNA translation. Although innocuous in healthy individuals, HCMV is a widespread, opportunistic
pathogen responsible for severe disease among the immunocompromised, including organ transplant
recipients and AIDS patients. In addition, congenital HCMV infection is the leading viral cause of birth defects
in newborns. Our long-term overall objective is to understand the mechanism(s) through which HCMV
manipulates the cellular translational machinery to control viral replication. A fundamental step
regulating protein synthesis in HCMV-infected cells involves ribosome recruitment to the 5'-end of m7G-capped
virus and host mRNAs. This typically involves 5'-cap-recognition by a translation initiation factor complex
containing the cap-binding protein eIF4E followed by loading the eIF3-bound 40S ribosome. Unexpectedly, an
alternative form of 40S ribosome loading relying upon cap-recognition by a specific eIF3 subunit, eIF3d, has
been described that bypasses the need for eIF4E and is distinctly regulated. Preliminary results establish that
targeting eIF3d selectively inhibited HCMV replication, reduced polyribosome abundance and interfered with
expression of essential virus late genes and a host gene expression signature indicative of chronic ER stress
that fosters HCMV reproduction. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that eIF3d-dependent cap-
recognition is hijacked to exploit virus-induced ER-stress and switching between eIF4E and eIF3d-responsive
translation differentially tunes virus and host gene expression in infected cells. This hypothesis is tested in
three specific aims designed to: i) determine how HCMV infection impacts eIF3d accumulation and sub-cellular
distribution; ii) define the mechanism whereby eIF3d selectively shapes the gene expression landscape in
HCMV-infected cells; and iii) decipher how eIF3d activity is regulated in HCMV-infected cells. The project is
impactful because how non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms involving eIF3d regulate differential
mRNA translation during stress responses like virus infection remains largely unknown and represents a
significant knowledge gap poised to reveal new biology and therapeutic opportunities for interfering with virus
replication or vaccine development. Furthermore, it will provide insight into fundamental translational control
mechanisms important in human diseases, like cancer and diabetes, where protein production is dysregulated."
10893931,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is a major source of illness in the United States with
over 476,000 cases per year. Like other vector-borne pathogens, B. burgdorferi must overcome a wide variety
of environmental stresses during its infectious cycle in ticks of the genus Ixodes, and various mammalian hosts.
Among the challenges faced by B. burgdorferi are shifts in pH, temperature, osmolarity, nutrient availability,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with nitric oxide (NO) and its congeners [reactive nitrogen species (RNS)
(e.g., NO, NO2•, N2O3 and ONOO-)]. Of these, the roles of temperature and pH on B. burgdorferi virulence gene
expression and infectivity have been the best characterized. Previously published work from our laboratory and
others have demonstrated that B. burgdorferi encounters biologically significant amounts of ROS and RNS
during infection of its tick vector Ixodes scapularis and mammalian hosts. We have also shown that cysteine
thiols of proteins involved in gene regulation, antioxidant defenses, and central metabolism are targets of ROS
and RNS, although the impact of these modifications on B. burgdorferi infectivity have yet to be determined. Our
previously published work showed the DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) is a global regulator of gene expression
in B. burgdorferi and coordinates the stringent response during periods of nutrient limitation. We now have
preliminary data supporting a role for DksA in regulating virulence gene expression required for completion of its
infectious cycle in I. scapularis and mammalian hosts. Despite this, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge
about how DksA senses changes within its vector and mammalian hosts to direct B. burgdorferi gene expression.
In this application, we propose to test our central hypothesis that DksA senses tick-borne ROS/RNS to coordinate
the transcriptional responses of B. burgdorferi required for the completion of its infectious cycle. This proposal is
particularly innovative and will impact the field of tick-borne diseases by determining the mechanisms underlying
the ability of B. burgdorferi to sense changes in its environment to regulate gene expression. Since this area of
research is virtually uninvestigated for tick-borne diseases, our findings will undoubtedly provide insight to the
field and inform future strategies to prevent tick-borne infections."
10812401,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Physical activity is a protective factor of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. While there are many
benefits to physical activity, adults with intellectual disability (ID) often do not engage in healthy physical
activity levels. With higher rates of early-onset dementias and age-related conditions in adults with ID,
developing improved strategies and programs that promote physical activity in this population is critical.
Barriers to physical activity include a lack of inclusive physical activity opportunities, access to community
exercise facilities, and reliance on external supports. The purpose of this NIH Stage 1 mixed methods study is
to test the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and prepare for a Stage 2 efficacy study of a multi-level physical
activity intervention. Step It Up+ is a 16-week multi-level program that utilizes self-management strategies,
including goal setting, self-monitoring, and visual supports to help adults with ID engage in the program more
independently through an interactive web-based dashboard. Adults with ID work with a support coach to
increase daily step counts and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by engaging in
individualized aerobic and strength training activities. Aim 1 is to modify, adapt, and refine our existing Step It
Up home-based program at the individual level of the socioecological model to include the community level
through a weekly inclusive group fitness class (Stage 1A). This phase will include usability testing, pilot testing
of the RCT assessment battery, and semi-structured interviews with adults with ID and surveys and focus
groups with additional stakeholders (parents, caregivers, and exercise professionals) to demonstrate the
features and functionality of the interactive web-based dashboard. Aim 2 is to conduct a pilot randomized
controlled trial (Stage 1B). This phase will use a waitlist control experimental design with 120 adults with ID in
two sites (North Carolina and Texas). Feasibility will be assessed quantitatively by measuring recruitment,
attendance, and completion rates. Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews will augment
the feasibility quantitative findings and provide feedback on consumer acceptability. Content experts will
evaluate treatment fidelity by reviewing a subsample of video-taped sessions. We will measure the impact of
Step It Up+ on increasing physical activity and explore hypotheses regarding the potential efficacy of the
intervention's effect on physical activity. We will compare primary outcomes of physical activity using daily step
counts, activity intensity minutes, body composition, and secondary outcomes of wellbeing, functioning, and
social belonging. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large-scale, for an R01 to
conduct a Stage 2 primary prevention trial in adults with ID who are pre-symptomatic of AD/ADRD. Our long-
term goal is to promote healthy physical activity behaviors through inclusive community settings, examine the
long-term impact of these programs in preventing Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in aging adults
with ID, and improve wellbeing in adults with ID."
10770481,"Transcription initiation is highly regulated by genomic elements in promoters and enhancers that bind
transcription factors and recruit RNA polymerase II (Pol II). After Pol II escapes from the promoter, many
regulatory steps occur during transcription elongation that control Pol II progression, RNA processing, and
finally release of the RNA from chromatin for nuclear export. These steps are tightly controlled by genomic and
epigenomic features, such as histone modifications, nucleosome positions, and cis-elements that bind
transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Current functional genomic technologies tend to
provide a static, averaged view of genomic function that obscure the transient roles that many genomic
elements play in shaping the transcriptome. To identify and characterize all functional genomic elements, we
need to develop approaches that quantitatively monitor the many layers of gene expression regulation,
including transient interactions and short-lived events. In the proposed research, we will create a suite of
genome-wide tools to map Pol II across single chromatin fibers, track the association of RBPs, and follow
RNAs from transcription initiation to nuclear export. These techniques will highlight unappreciated connections
between genomic elements, molecular events on chromatin, and post-initiation regulatory events. Our rationale
is that by creating tools to quantify short-lived steps in mRNA production, unappreciated functional roles for
genomic elements can be revealed. To demonstrate how these technologies reveal unappreciated gene
regulatory mechanisms, we will apply them to the heat shock response (HSR), a stress response that has
served as a model to study the many regulatory layers in gene expression. In Aim 1 we will develop a strategy
that reveals Pol II locations across single long chromatin fibers. Fiber-seq is a method that identifies regions of
accessible DNA across long (up to ~20 kb) chromatin fibers one molecule at a time. We will extend this
approach to identify Pol II footprints, analyze the distributions of Pol II complexes across gene bodies, and
characterize the interactions between Pol II complexes and nucleosomes. In Aim 2 we will measure the timing
of binding of proteins across long pre-mRNA molecules. RBP binding will be marked by RNA editing and long-
read direct RNA sequencing of nascent RNA (nano-COP) will enable us to resolve transient binding events
that impact pre-mRNA processing and nuclear export. These events are transient, as many RBPs bind to
introns and are released from RNA in the cytoplasm immediately after nuclear export. In Aim 3, we will create
an approach to measure kinetics of RNA production, chromatin release, and nuclear export that couples 4sU
metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNAs with biochemical purification of RNAs from chromatin,
nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. The data from this technique will allow us to estimate the rates of release of RNA
from chromatin, nuclear export of RNA, and cytoplasmic degradation of every RNA. Using public datasets from
ENCODE and elsewhere, we will identify and test hypotheses for the determinants of RNA lifetimes."
10811663,"Pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including pediatric epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and
intellectual disability, represent a major source of morbidity, yet our therapeutic options remain limited.
Development of novel therapies for NDD will require a deeper mechanistic understanding of normal and
abnormal brain development. This proposal focuses on genetic programs that are activated in response to
neuronal activity and that are fundamental to normal neurodevelopment and on-going neuronal plasticity
throughout life. Fos is a major activity-dependent transcription factor that binds to distal enhancer elements and
regulates downstream activity-dependent genetic programs in a cell-type-specific manner to promote key
processes, including synaptic pruning and the recruitment of inhibition in the developing brain. Despite its role in
key developmental processes, we do not understand how Fos is differentially targeted to cell-type-specific
binding sites, nor how genetic variation at these sites impacts neurodevelopment and neuronal function.
Interestingly, Fos has been shown to physically interact with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, and it is
possible that this interaction is critical to Fos function. Many BAF subunits, most frequently ARID1B, are
implicated in human NDD, but whether the BAF complex regulates neuronal activity-dependent genetic
programs, and how this underlies aspects of BAF complex-related NDD, is previously unexplored. The research
in this proposal will address these gaps in knowledge by: (a) profiling Fos and BAF complex neuronal binding
sites across the human genome; (b) assessing human genetic variants at these sites in individuals with NDD vs
controls; and (c) determining the effects of BAF complex perturbation on neuronal activity-dependent genetic
programs in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this work will lead to greater insight into how activity-dependent genetic
programs contribute to NDD pathogenesis. Additionally, by identifying specific activity-regulated genes and
pathways that are mis-regulated downstream of Fos and the BAF complex, these experiments could highlight
novel therapeutic targets for NDD.
This research is the basis for a five-year career development program designed to build on Dr. Trowbridge’s
background in molecular neuroscience, pediatric neurology/epilepsy, and neurogenetics, by providing her with
additional training in analysis of human sequencing data, use of in vitro and in vivo models of NDD, and next-
generation sequencing technologies. Her primary mentor, Dr. Mike Greenberg, and her scientific advisory
committee, Drs. Annapurna Poduri and Chris Walsh, will provide guidance in these areas, as well as mentorship
in the rigorous and ethical conduct of translational neuroscience research. Thus the proposed training plan will
position Dr. Trowbridge to launch her independent career as a clinician-scientist focused on understanding the
role of activity-dependent genetic programs in NDD."

Diseases of the ear, particularly acute otitis media (AOM) and middle ear effusions, are the most commonly
treated childhood pathologies. The financial burden of ear disease is estimated at more than $3.2 billion per
year. Because ear diseases are common, a significant problem is over-diagnosis and over-treatment, due to two
factors. First, the subjective nature of diagnosing ear disease - based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum with an
otoscope - makes an accurate diagnosis difficult, even for experienced primary care, emergency medicine, or
ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US,
more Advanced Practice Providers (Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants) serve as first-line clinicians in
primary care and emergency settings but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e., clinical examination of the
eardrum). Consequently, clinicians often err on the side of making a diagnosis of ear infection and prescribing
oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events.
Children with inaccurate ear diagnoses are often referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes for
recurrent infections, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing ear pathologies still depends
on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical
barrier to decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of ear disease. Devices
are needed to assist in a more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of ear pathology. Our previous work
laid the foundation to develop machine-learning approaches to provide an objective approach to ear diagnosis
using digital otoscopy computer-assisted image analysis. This project will dramatically expand on our previous
work with the overarching goal of developing new machine learning applications to analyze eardrum videos
collected with a digital otoscope, which will be combined with tympanometry, demographic, and clinical data, to
achieve diagnostic objectivity. The long-term goal is to improve clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases,
using novel computer-assisted approaches. To accomplish these goals, we propose three Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1 will refine an objective computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software to differentiate
multiple eardrum abnormalities. Specific Aim 2 will develop an otoscopy clinical decision support
system by combining CAIA with additional data sources, including tympanometry, demographic, and
clinical information. Specific Aim 3 will determine how the otoscopy clinical decision support system
improves clinicians’ diagnostic performance."

World Trade Center (WTC) responders were exposed to a mix of tiny dust particles as they participated in rescue
and recovery efforts at the WTC in the aftermath of 9/11/2001. A significant number continue to suffer from Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of their experiences. These may have changed their expectations
of health as they age. Our team has interrogated the potential for early signs of cognitive aging and has identified
higher than expected burden of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and, surprisingly, changes to physical functional
limitations (PFL) common in both physical disability and in neurodegenerative disease. Given the magnitude and
scale of events surrounding 9/11 and the level of exposure within a young civilian population, prior studies are
insufficient in determining the pathogenesis of MCI in the WTC responder cohort. We propose that MCI is arising
early because PTSD causes a neuroinflammatory response resulting in increased activation of the pituitary gland
resulting in increased Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. We propose to conduct a large longitudinal PET/MRI
study of 120 medically-healthy WTC responders using two well-validated positron emission tomography (PET)
ligands ([11C]-PiB to measure β-amyloid, and [18F]-Flortaucipir to measure tauopathy). Detailed cognitive testing
will help to determine the level of cognitive dysfunction. Simultaneous structural MRI will be used to measure the
extent of neurodegeneration. Proteomic analyses will be completed to track changes and to validate a monitoring
program for biomarkers in this population. This study is timely because we are in a critical period when
neuropathology is still emerging."

The proposed research of this R01 application focuses on creating a second-generation glucagon-like peptide-
1 (GLP-1)-based pharmaceutical that retains all of the blood glucose lowering profiles but completely eliminates
the major side effects of nausea, vomiting and malaise. Such side effects, along with hypophagia, are produced
by existing GLP-1R agonists due to central nervous system (CNS) penetrance and direct action in the brain.
Thus, we sought to create GLP-1R agonists with reduced brain penetrance but with the full potent
pharmacodynamic profile on pancreatic GLP-1R populations. Our novel preliminary data convincingly
demonstrate the ability of a vitamin B12 (B12) conjugate of the GLP1-R agonist Exendin-4 (Ex4), namely (B12-
Ex4), to produce hypoglycemia in a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in both mouse and rat models without producing
hypophagia or nausea/malaise. This glucoregulation without nausea/malaise appears to be due to a virtual
absence of ligand penetrance into the CNS, a hypothesis supported by radiolabelled B12 studies showing
extremely low levels of B12 entry into the brain, as well as immunohistochemical analyses of fluorescently-
tagged B12-Ex4 in comparison to native Ex4 at the site of CNS activation. This application therefore tests the
following specific aims to both enhance the preclinical assessment of B12-Ex4 as a second-generation T2DM
therapeutic and test the hypothesis that the total portfolio of therapeutic effects that exploit the `B12-family' can
be enhanced by conjugation of Ex4 to a fragment of B12, specifically cobinamide (Cbi), which targets Haptocorrin
(HC), a Cbi binding protein found only in mammals, including humans: [1] Characterizes the physiological,
behavioral and anatomical mechanisms mediating the hypoglycemic effects of B12-Ex4 without the incidence of
hypophagia and nausea/malaise using both lean/euglycemic and obese/hyperglycemic rat and mouse models;
[2] Conducts systematic in vitro and in vivo analyses of a novel Cbi-Ex4 compound for glucoregulation without
eliciting nausea/emesis or competing with endogenous B12 transport in the musk shrew which both is capable
of emesis and expresses HC, like the human, but unlike the mouse and rat. The compounds described herein
also offer scope to investigate, through relatively simple experimentation, the role of CNS versus periphery in
the function of GLP-1R agonists in animals and humans. As such they have significant potential as investigative
research probes in addition to their clear potential as a new generation of therapeutics. Most notably, these
highly innovative experiments will provide the necessary pre-clinical analyses for the B12- and/or Cbi-based
conjugates of Ex4. Such studies will lead to significantly improved, clinically beneficial, second generation
therapeutics for the treatment of T2DM without the most common nausea/malaise side effects of existing GLP-
1-based therapeutics, which will improve patient quality of life, patient compliance to therapy, and expand the
population that can benefit from the amazing improved glycemic profile achieved with GLP-1R agonists."
10806137,"Abstract:
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor drugs (PARPi's) have emerged as important new therapeutic
agents targeting a broadening class of gene mutations present in breast, ovarian, prostate and a host of other
cancers. Identification of patients who might benefit from PARPi's has relied on assays for defects in homologous
recombination (HRD), such as BRCA1/2 mutations, but these assays have been imperfect predictors of response
to PARPi's. Drug binding to PARP1 present in tumor cells is a common and necessary factor for effective PARPi
therapy. [18F]fluorthanatrace (FTT) is a PET-labeled analog of the PARPi rucaparib, and early clinical data in
ovarian and breast cancer trials support [18F]FTT tumor uptake as an in-vivo measure of regional PARP1 drug
binding, and indicate the potential of [18F]FTT PET as a PARPi predictive imaging biomarker. [18F]FTT could
therefore provide benefits for patients with breast and other cancers by identifying those most likely to respond
to PARPi therapy, while sparing those who will not respond from toxicity, unnecessary expense, and wasted
time.
To further the development, clinical translation, and commercialization of [18F]FTT, we propose an Academic
Industrial Partnership (AIP) comprised of The University of Pennsylvania ((Penn), lead academic partner), MD
Anderson Cancer Center(MDACC), and Washington University (WU) with Trevarx Biomedical, Inc (Trevarx).
Trevarx, a radiopharmaceutical corporation with the exclusive license for [18F]FTT, is developing [18F]FTT as an
imaging biomarker to guide PARPi treatment, with a first indication in breast cancer. Based on discussions with
the FDA and advisors, [18F]FTT approval will require a Phase 3 study of the accuracy of [18F]FTT PET/CT for
diagnosing PARP1 expressing cancer. The aims of this AIP proposal focus on critical components necessary for
a Phase 3 trial for [18F]FTT FDA approval: (1) a Trevarx-held IND with standardized tracer production
methodology and product specification; (2) validation of an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay of PARP1
expression in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue as a reference standard for [18F]FTT PET
diagnostic accuracy; and (3) a Phase 2 multi-center trial to test and validate methods in a multi-center setting
and provide preliminary data to design the pivotal Phase 3 trial. Completion of the these aims will enable a Phase
3 trial to support [18F]FTT FDA approval, commercial supply of [18F]FTT, and ongoing research by the academic
partners to document the value of [18F]FTT PET/CT for guiding PARPi treatment, including prospective multi-
center biomarker-focused studies."
11082166,"Project summary and significance: Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and is
estimated to be the third most common movement disorder in the United States. Dystonia can be the primary
symptom in patients of all ages or present as a secondary symptom in patients with neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative disorders and affects function of many nodes in the motor circuit, including the thalamus,
basal ganglia, motor cortex, and cerebellum. This neurological diversity – in addition to the genetic heterogeneity
of hereditary dystonia – has made it difficult to pinpoint therapeutic targets. A better understanding of the
pathophysiology of dystonia is indispensable to the development of more effective treatments. Recent studies
suggest that cerebellar pathophysiology forms a shared mechanism for the inception of etiologically distinct
dystonias; nearly all animal models with overt dystonia-like symptoms have abnormalities in the spiking activity
of cerebellar neurons. Yet, the precise mechanism of cerebellar dysfunction in dystonia is enigmatic, especially
because cerebellar pathophysiology is primarily known to cause other motor disorders, like ataxia and tremor.
This Pathway to Independence Award proposal leverages quantitative, in vivo electrophysiology in genetic,
developmental, and optogenetic mouse models of dystonia to define a dystonia-specific spiking signature in
cerebellar output neurons, and to deduce the developmental divergence of cerebellar function between healthy
and dystonic mice. This knowledge will provide a biomarker and therapeutic target for dystonia, which will be
invaluable for designing new treatments that alleviate or prevent symptoms onset in patients or mutation carriers.
Candidate and career development: Dr. Meike van der Heijden was trained in developmental neuroscience in
the laboratory of Dr. Huda Zoghbi, where she used intersectional genetics to unveil the function and identity of
brainstem respiratory neurons essential for postnatal survival. She then joined the laboratory of Dr. Roy Sillitoe,
a world-leader in cerebellar neuroscience with a strong record of NIH funding, mentorship, and scientific
leadership. Here, she developed an analytical platform and generated a database to assess spiking activity in
cerebellar neurons across mouse models of cerebellar disease (dystonia, ataxia, tremor), and studied how
impaired maturation of cerebellar Purkinje cell function leads to neurological deficits. In this proposal, Dr. Van
der Heijden will build on her skills in in vivo electrophysiology, mouse genetics, and neuroanatomy and expand
her analytical tool-kit, broaden her skills in unbiased quantitative motor function assessment, and acquire
proficiency in acute manipulation of cerebellar circuits using optogenetics. All experiments will be conducted in
the Neurological Research Institute, a collaborative research institute for clinical excellence and world-class

 External datasets have the potential to improve final analyses and interim decisions of future single-
arm and randomized clinical trials. They can also accelerate the development of new treatments, by
reducing the number of patients that need to be enrolled in clinical studies and therefore their
duration. However the use of external information to analyze clinical trials is currently sporadic.
Indeed, the integration of external patient-level information to test new treatments can increase the
risk of bias in the evaluation of experimental treatments. An effective use of external data in the
design and analysis of clinical studies requires both, adequate statistical methodologies, and
validation analyses, to quantify risks and potential efficiency gains compared to standard statistical
plans of single-arm and randomized trial designs.
We will develop novel designs to use external data in future trials. We will use collections of datasets
in prostate cancer, glioblastoma, and lung cancer, including patient-level outcomes and prognostic
variables. These collections are necessary to effectively use external data in clinical studies. We will
then introduce and apply validation methods to evaluate statistical designs using disease-specific
data collections, inclusive of clinical trials and real world data. The validation summaries that we will
produce, will quantify the efficiency of trial designs and the risks of the integration of external data,
associated for example, to unmeasured confounders or measurement errors on prognostic variables
and outcome."

Black and Latinx individuals are at higher risk for certain autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) and have
experienced worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to their white counterparts. The American College of
Rheumatology recommends beyond the initial COVID-19 vaccination, subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses to
complete the primary vaccination series and a booster dose in people with AIRD. Yet, historically, overall
vaccine uptake among people with AIRDs has been low, and this vaccine reluctance has extended to COVID-
19 vaccination. This proposal will harness community-engaged methods to develop and test the effectiveness
of a multi-modal intervention that combines “storytelling” videos and patient navigation to increase uptake of
recommended COVID-19 vaccination among Black and Latinx AIRD patients in two distinct US geographic
regions. Aim 1 will develop a multi-modal intervention that includes a) “storytelling” videos we will produce with
vaccinated Black or Latinx patients with AIRDs narrating their COVID-19 vaccination experiences, and b) a
patient navigation approach to encourage recommended COVID-19 vaccination. Navigators will be trained
using virtual case simulation to discuss up-to-date guidance and provide logistical support for vaccination. In
Aim 2a we will recruit 1,170 racial and ethnic minority patients from 4 rheumatology clinics in the Southern and
Northeastern U.S. to participate in this patient-level, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial. Participants
will be randomized to receive at the routine clinic visit either “storytelling” OR an “attention-control” plus usual
care. At the clinic visit, coordinators will invite participants to view “storytelling” videos on tablet computers
deployed in a private clinic area. At 2 days after the clinic visit, the navigators will contact each participant
remotely (phone/video calls) to provide customized assistance for vaccination. A second contact will occur ~2
weeks later. We will examine the differences in rates of COVID-19 vaccine receipt between racial/ethnic
minority participants with AIRD exposed to our multi-modal intervention versus an “attention-control” video
(focused on the merits of a balanced diet/exercise on health status) plus usual care. We will measure rates of
receipt of subsequent COVID-19 vaccination at 3 months after the clinic visit using extant linkages to state
vaccination records (primary endpoint). We will measure via surveys COVID-19 vaccine confidence, influenza
vaccine uptake (self-report) as a proxy for intervention effect on vaccination behavior for other vaccines, self-
efficacy, and social health. We will explore whether insurance status and education moderate COVID-19
vaccine uptake. In Aim 2b, using surveys and semi-structured interviews, we will assess how intervention
components achieved their effects to inform future scale-up of our intervention. Beyond our innovative
approach and experienced team, a key strength of our study is its generalizability since we are including two
geographically distinct regions with substantial ethnic/racial diversity in their populations that deliver care to
many uninsured, Medicaid, and other historically marginalized groups."
10756133,"Currently, the single best predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 monotherapy is PD-L1 expression as
assessed by immunohistochemical staining of archived or fresh tissue. Current workflows for PD-L1
assessment in tissue are labor and time consuming, are not infallible (inconclusive results in a fraction of
image guided biopsies) and are associated with morbidity and are thus rarely performed serially. Rapid on site
assessment of cellular, rather than tissue, specimens obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) could not
only circumvent these bottlenecks but also enable more comprehensive and serial profiling of the tumor
microenvironment to obtain the most up-to-date information of a rapidly changing microenvironment during
tumor evolution and therapy. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate the new FAST-FNA
technology for rapid biomarker discovery and validation in HNSCCs. There are two main aims. In aim 1 we will
develop and validate existing and new biomarkers in FNA samples of HNSCC patients (n=100). Specifically we
will I) develop and validate new predictive immunotherapeutic biomarkers and ii to determine how well the new
FAST-FNA scores correlate with the CPS scores of PD-L1. The goal of the second aim is to translate the
above FAST-FNA technology to serial FNA analyses in HNSCC patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy
(with or without chemotherapy; n=100). FNA sampling will be performed pre- and on-treatment in order to
capture changes in the tumor microenvironment. As the HNSCC field shifts toward increased biomarker
testing, we find an unmet clinical need to develop advanced cellular diagnostics in HNSCCs, which will
facilitate rapid biomarker analysis, guide therapies and provide “real time” assessment of clinical response."

The purpose of the proposed renewal is to add a longitudinal component for the purpose of
generating risk models to predict progression in ocular diseases that include biomechanical
metrics established at baseline. A novel metric of Corneal Contribution to Stress was
developed at baseline that represents long-term adaptation to asymmetric biomechanical
properties in keratoconus which we propose will predict progression over the follow-up period.
An additional metric of cornea compressibility will be included in the progression model. In
Diabetes without retinopathy, we propose that scleral stiffness will predict development of
diabetic retinopathy during the follow-up period, and that increased scleral stiffness is a
cumulative indicator of long-term hyperglycemia which we attribute to the formation of non-
enzymatic cross-links in the sclera. Hemoglobin A1c will be included in the model as a discrete
indicator of hyperglycemia. Finally, we propose to add elastic and viscoelastic biomechanical
metrics to the risk model from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study to predict the
conversion from ocular hypertension to glaucoma. Elastic parameters include corneal stiffness
and scleral stiffness, and the viscoelastic parameter is corneal hysteresis. Once completed,
these risk models can be translated to the clinic as new tools to aid in the management of
multiple ocular conditions.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults and is virtually
incurable. Despite aggressive treatments that include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the average
survival is 15.4 months, with less than 5% of patients surviving > 5 years. Immunotherapy is a promising new
approach to treat GBM as it harnesses one’s own immune system to recognize and kill aberrant cancer cells.
Unfortunately, ongoing trials with immunotherapies show disappointing results in most GBM patients, indicating
that we need to better understand the intricate and dynamic interactions between glioma and immune cells that
generate and maintain highly immune suppressive microenvironment in GBM.
The major goal of this application is to test our hypothesis that S100A4 is a critical regulator of the GBM
immune landscape. S100A4 is a small calcium binding protein that functions intracellularly as well as
extracellularly. We recently reported that S100A4 is necessary for human and mouse glioma stem cell self-
renewal. Our single cell RNA-sequencing analyses of human GBM shows that S100A4 is expressed in both
glioma cells and immune suppressive leukocytes. Consistently, TCGA data analyses indicate that S100A4
expression is strongly correlated with primary and recurrent GBM patient survival, the mesenchymal subtype,
and immune-suppressive macrophage markers (such as CD163, CD206, and IL10). Importantly, our
unpublished results show that S100A4 in human and mouse glioma cells regulates expression of chemokines
and cytokines that control immune cell infiltration and polarization towards immune suppressive phenotypes.
Notably, knocking down S100a4 in glioma cells is sufficient to reprogram the immune environment and allow
dramatic increase in T-cell infiltration and activation in mouse gliomas. Furthermore, deletion of S100a4 in the
host mouse is also sufficient to reprogram the glioma immune landscape and extend survival (manuscripts in
preparation). Therefore, we hypothesize that S100A4 functions in both glioma and immune to promote
immune-suppressive environment in GBM through multiple mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we will:
1) elucidate mechanisms through which S100A4 expression in glioma cells promotes local immune-suppressive
microenvironment in GBM (Aim 1); and 2) determine mechanisms through which S100a4 expression in immune
cells controls myeloid and T cell trafficking, polarization, and function (Aim2). Successful completion of this study
will reveal how S100A4 regulates glioma associated immune cell infiltration/polarization and identify a potential
novel immunotherapy target to treat GBM."

 Contemporary ocular surgeries are performed by skilled surgeons through operating microscopes,
utilizing freehand techniques and manually operated precision micro-instruments, where the outcomes are often
limited by the surgeon's skill levels and experiences. To overcome these human factors, we have assembled
an interdisciplinary team including a clinician-scientist and eye surgeon, an optical device scientist and medical
robotic engineers to translate existing and developing technologies in our laboratories into precision, “deep-
learning” artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic ocular surgical devices for precise automated Deep Anterior
Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK).
 DALK is a highly attractive treatment of corneal disease with normally functioning endothelium. However,
the procedure is unusually challenging from a technical perspective and time-consuming, limiting its acceptance
among corneal surgeons. The most challenging aspect of the procedure is related to the delamination of stroma
from Descemet's membrane (DM). A procedure, commonly called “Big Bubble” is used to separate stroma from
DM using deep intrastromal pneumatic injection. However, even experienced surgeons have difficulty precisely
placing the injection. The most common complication of DALK is the excessive depth of the needle insertion
resulting in Descemet's membrane perforation requiring conversion to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty
with its much longer recovery period and a higher risk of graft failure from rejection. The reported rates of
Descemet's membrane perforation for beginner and experienced surgeons are 31.8% and 11.7% respectively.
In addition, interface haze between the donor and recipient cornea is a common problem caused by the
insufficient depth of needle insertion and failure to remove the host stromal tissue, which results in loss of
postoperative visual acuity. These problems relate directly to the inability of the current surgical practice to
precisely assess the depth of the tooltips inside the cornea layer in real-time.
 Here we will build upon our previous and ongoing work in robust fiber optic common-path optical
coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and AI-guide system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) robotic
microsurgical tools that enable clinicians to precisely guide surgical tools at micron scale. The proposed AUTO-
DALK surgical tool system is capable of one-dimensional real-time depth tracking, motion compensation, and
detection of early instrument contact with tissue, which enables clinicians to perform DALK precisely and safely.
The tool will be built on a handheld platform that will consist of CP-OCT probe, trephine and microinjector that
allows precise and safe removal of the anterior section of cornea down to DM
 We hypothesize that AI-OCT providing intelligent visualization and depth controlled optimal cornea
cutting and tissue tracking will perform the task of DALK with better accuracy and efficiency over the manually
performed trephine cutting and “Big Bubble” pneumodissection."
10792893,"Project Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most lethal human cancers with extensive genetic and cellular heterogeneity.
Genetic heterogeneity in GBM is seen through activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including
EGFR. Approximately ~50-60% of GBM tumors harbor amplification of the EGFR gene, including the
constitutively active variant EGFRvIII, and point mutations within the extracellular domain of EGFR. Clinical effort
at targeting EGFR itself has failed to increase survival, in part due to redundancy in the downstream signaling
pathways triggered through EGFR or other oncogenic RTKs. Our data shows that EGFRvIII and possibly the hot
spot mutations promote therapeutic resistance through downstream activation of oncogenic STAT5 signaling.
Thus, understanding how STAT5 can serve as a point of convergence for oncogenic RTKs, such as EGFR will
provide new opportunities for therapeutic interventions in GBM patients. One of the reasons why role of STAT5
signaling has been underappreciated in GBM is because long-term cultured GBM cells often lose EGFRvIII
expression and do not show STAT5 activation. However, primary GBMs that retain EGFRvIII expression
exhibit active STAT5 signaling. Our data indicate that EGFRvIII signaling activates STAT5 through JAK1/2-
independent mechanisms and represents an attractive RTK model for understanding the role of STAT5 in
GBM. We also find that therapy-resistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) that retain EGFRvIII expression also
have increased STAT5 activation. In GSCs, EGFR participates in a feed-forward loop with a key cell fate
and pro-mitogenic transcription factor, OLIG2. GSCs depleted of OLIG2 show decreased levels of phospho-
STAT5 and expression of its downstream targets, (e.g. Fn14). Both STAT5 and OLIG2 function as dimers
and in GSCs we find that STAT5 interacts with OLIG2. Furthermore, STAT5 inhibition decreases OLIG2-
dependent GSC invasion. However, the upstream molecular mechanisms involved in OLIG2-dependent
activation of STAT5 and signaling pathway(s) regulated by the OLIG2-STAT5 complex must be identified
to effectively target the infiltrative and resistant glioma stem cells. We hypothesize that activation of
STAT5-OLIG2 signaling mediated by oncogenic RTKs, such as EGFRvIII, promote increased invasion,
therapy resistance, and stemness properties in GBM. Aim 1 will determine the mechanistic role of STAT5
isoform signaling in the context of EGFR variants in GBM cells. Aim 2 will determine the molecular
mechanism(s) involved in OLIG2-mediated regulation of STAT5 activation in GSCs. Aim 3 will assess the
functional and clinical significance of STAT5-OLIG2 signaling axis in GBM. Success of the proposal will
identify, validate, and place into a clinically meaningful context the STAT5/OLIG2 signaling pathway as a
therapeutic target for infiltrating cells that commonly underlie GBM fatality."

 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system developmental disorder caused by mutations in
the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The protein products of these genes form a complex that is an essential negative
regulator of mTORC1 signaling. In the absence of a functional TSC1/2 complex, mTORC1 signaling is
deregulated and constitutively active. While the manifestations of TSC can affect several different organ
systems, the neurological and psychiatric aspects of the disease are the most burdensome for caregivers and
least well understood. These include early-onset epilepsy, varying degrees of intellectual disability, and a high
prevalence of autism spectrum disorder and other behavioral conditions. A hallmark pathology of TSC is the
presence of cortical tubers, which are focal regions of enlarged, dysplastic neurons and glia in the cortex that
form during embryonic development. Cortical tubers can become epileptic foci and in some cases are
surgically removed in individuals with intractable seizures. The size and number of cortical tubers is variable
between patients and increased cortical tuber load is associated with worse outcomes including more severe
epilepsy and cognitive impairment.
 The goal of this project is to determine the molecular mechanism(s) by which mutations in TSC1 or
TSC2 lead to the formation of cortical tuber cells. To do this we will use our recently established human brain
organoid models of TSC in which we have engineered loss of function mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. These
human brain organoid models robustly reproduce key cellular features of cortical tubers including dysmorphic
neurons, reactive astrocytes, and giant/balloon cells. In addition, we have observed a strong bias towards the
production of glial-lineage cells at the expense of neurons in TSC brain organoids, which recapitulates
observations from patient tuber samples. Here we will define the molecular basis for altered cortical cell
development due to TSC1/2 mutations and investigate how the resulting tuber cells impact the function of the
surrounding cortical network. In Aim 1 we will explore two potential hypotheses for altered differentiation of
TSC1/2 mutant cells in brain organoids: 1) premature activation of astrogenic transcription programs that
interfere with normal neurogenesis and/or 2) impaired survival and development of newborn neurons. To test
these hypotheses we will use pharmacological, shRNA, and CRISPRi manipulations to test the contribution of
candidate pathways. In Aim 2 we will use different strategies to manipulate mTORC1 signaling and specific
downstream arms of the pathway to test whether these can prevent or rescue altered cellular development. In
Aim 3, we will perform functional analyses to determine how the presence of cortical tuber cells impacts the
activity of the surrounding cortical network. Together the results of these aims will generate new insights into
the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to cortical tuber formation and how these cells ultimately
impact cortical function."

 Cocaine is the most widely abused psychostimulant by a wide margin, and it remains a major public
health problem in the US. Cocaine use was slowly declining, but in recent years there has been a resurgence in
cocaine abuse accompanied by a sharp increase in cocaine-related hospitalizations and deaths. These facts
highlight the need for effective medications for cocaine use disorder (CUD) because there are presently no FDA-
approved pharmacologic treatments for CUD. Our exciting preliminary results highlight a novel molecular
substrate that could be targeted to attenuate or prevent cocaine taking and seeking. Specifically, we show that
cocaine exposure alters the expression of KCC2, a K+-Cl- cotransporter that defines the Cl- gradient in midbrain
GABA neurons. Importantly, this cocaine-induced neuroadaptation is associated with circuitry changes in
midbrain GABA neurons that promote and elevate further cocaine taking. These findings support the working
hypothesis that initial cocaine taking alters midbrain GABAergic circuitry and increases the vulnerability for
increased cocaine consumption over time. Thus, KCC2 represents a potential therapeutic target to treat CUD.
 KCC2 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, and it is amenable to therapeutic manipulation
in humans. KCC2 is highly attractive as a therapeutic target because it is usually constitutively highly active.
Therefore, when normal subjects are treated with KCC2 activators, KCC2 activity is already high, such that
attempts to increase its activity further do not produce deleterious side effects. Under normal physiological
conditions, KCC2 maintains a low intra-neuronal Cl- concentration required for hyperpolarizing, inhibitory
GABAergic currents. Our preliminary results indicate that cocaine dose-dependently downregulates KCC2 function
in midbrain GABA neurons, thereby altering midbrain GABAergic circuitry. As a consequence of these circuitry
changes, downregulation of KCC2 leads to increased cocaine self-administration. That is, cocaine use itself, by
downregulating KCC2, perpetuates heavy cocaine self-administration. Our preliminary results indicate that if we
prevent KCC2 downregulation or correct KCC2 function, then we decrease cocaine self-administration.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the functional state of the midbrain GABAergic circuitry
and the disposition of KCC2 function during cocaine self-administration, extinction, and the reinstatement of
cocaine seeking (Aims1 & 2). At each phase of the addiction cycle, we will determine the functional state of the
midbrain GABAergic circuitry as a causal contributor to cocaine taking or seeking. Finally, we will apply two
mechanistically different pharmacotherapies to boost KCC2 function to decrease cocaine self-administration and
cocaine-seeking behavior during abstinence (Aim3). These translationally-relevant studies will test potential
therapeutic drugs acting to boost KCC2 function to mitigate enhanced cocaine self-administration induced by
cocaine itself. The proposed studies of KCC2 as a novel therapeutic target to mitigate CUD are timely, highly
significant, and appropriately aimed at the factors underlying the transition to heavy cocaine use."
10754564,"Title: LysoPI/GPR55 pathway promotes endothelial activation, vascular inflammation and
atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis and its complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Novel
antiinflammatory therapies are urgently needed to inhibit atherosclerosis. The goal of this project is to
determine the roles and mechanisms underlying lysophosphatidylinositol (lysoPI) promoted endothelial
cell (EC) activation and atherosclerosis. We published numerous papers on EC activation,
atherosclerosis and lysophospholipids (lysolipids). Our strong preliminary data and publications
show that: 1) we reported a new concept that most lysolipids are new conditional classical damage-
associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) that do not bind to classical DAMP receptors but bind to their
own receptors to stimulate inflammation; 2) our metabolomics data showed that lysoPI is significantly
increased in the aortas and plasma of ApoE-/- mice fed with high fat diet (HF) for three weeks; 3) lysoPI
specifically bind to its receptor, G protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), and activates primary human
aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by upregulating EC adhesion molecule ICAM-1; 4) Mechanistically,
lysoPI induces generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in HAECs and induces
proinflammatory proteinarginine methyltransferase 1(PRMT1) activity; 5) our RNA-Seq data showed
that significantly different from that induced by lysoPI's relative lysoPC, lysoPI induces sustained EC
activation by upregulating DAMP receptors inflammasomes/caspase-1 and proinflammatory
secretomes; 6) we established ApoE-/-/GPR55-/- DKO mice; and DKO mice have significantly
decreased atherosclerosis in comparison to that in ApoE KO mice fed with HF for 12 weeks; and finally,
7) we generated EC-specific GPR55 KO mice and PRMT1 KO mice. Based on our strong preliminary
data and publications, the central
hypothesis
to be tested is that early hyperlipidemia-induced lysoPI
stimulates and sustains aortic EC activation via a GPR55-PRMT1 pathway, proinflammatory monocyte
(MC) recruitment, thereby contributing to atherosclerosis. We will test this hypothesis using three aims.
Aim 1 will determine expression and function of lysoPI/GPR55-PRMT1 pathway in HAECs activated by
hyperlipidemic stimuli and in aortas of ApoE-/- mice (relevant studies). Aim 2 will examine the
mechanisms by which lysoPI/GPR55 induces sustained aortic EC activation via inducing PRMT1
upregulation-mtROS generation, which further prolongs EC activation (mechanistic studies). Aim 3 will
determine whether inhibition of lysoPI/GPR55 and PRMT1 in EC (EC-specific KO) and other vascular
cells (global KO) would decrease atherogenesis in ApoE-/- mice (therapeutic studies)."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) along with other age-related
neurodegenerative diseases contribute to significant morbidity and costs for the aging population
worldwide. Advances in this field have uncovered that bilingualism is a protective factor that
delays onset of ADRD and may enhance cognitive reserve. Still, little is clearly known about the
direct impact of bilingualism on cognitive reserve and ADRD progression; multiple, entangled
confounding variables, such as lifestyle and psychological resilience, complicate the relationship
between bilingualism and cognition and warrant further investigation. Other major shortcomings
in previous studies include small sample size, lack of population diversity and insufficient data on
relevant covariates. We aim to address these critical gaps via the following specific aims.
In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs)
from millions of patients across three geographically and demographically diverse sites (i.e., MGB
[Boston, MA], UTHealth [Houston, TX], and UC Davis [Sacramento, CA]). We will develop robust
algorithms to identify potential monolingual and bilingual cohorts and their phenotypes. We will
disseminate reproducible informatics methods to support research cross-institutionally.
In Aim 2, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate the dynamic cognitive changes
in monolingual and bilingual older adults. We will explore potential pathways by which bilingualism
impacts cognitive decline over time using comprehensive instruments and surveys to repeatedly
measure cognitive resilience, cognitive reserve, and related factors, including social support,
psychological resilience, and physical activity.
In Aim 3, we will develop and validate machine learning algorithms to identify onset of age-related
cognitive decline and dementia using EHR data. We will apply the validated language classifier
for all participating EHR systems to examine the role of bilingualism in relation to the progression
of cognitive decline and the effect of other factors recorded in EHR data.
By integrating multiple disciplines to explore the influence of bilingualism on cognitive reserve,
this proposed design will address major gaps and challenges in this field. Such research has the
potential to transform the current understanding of neural and behavioral pathways in relation to
language, culture, and environment. Furthermore, the knowledge gained may translate to
improvements in existing interventions and novel therapeutic approaches for ADRD."
10757927,"Axonal Pathology and TBI-Related Neurodegeneration (TReND)
Over the last decade there has been an explosion of interest in the link between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and
the development of late neurodegenerative pathologies, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy
neuropathologic change (CTE-NC) and their association with increased risk of adverse cognitive outcomes,
including Alzheimer’s disease and Alzhemier’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). However, the
intense focus on neurofibrillary tangles in CTE-NC has come at the expense of investigation of the broader
spectrum of pathologies found after all forms of TBI. Accordingly, to better reflect the complex neuropathology
emerging after TBI, which includes many of the common pathologies of AD/ADRD, we have adopted the
conceptual framework, “TBI-related neurodegeneration” (TReND), of which CTE-NC is just one form. We
propose to examine the evolution of TReND in those with history of single moderate or severe (sTBI) or repetitive
mild TBI (rTBI), which we will directly compare to the pathologies of both ‘normal’ aging and wider
neurodegenerative disease, including AD/ADRD. Further, we propose to examine these changes in context of
diffuse axonal injury (DAI), one of the most common pathologies found across all severities of TBI, in which
we hypothesize that some axons may undergo repair, while others are driven towards degeneration. Notably,
through this grant award, we have demonstrated that axon degeneration persists for decades after TBI leading
to ongoing release of amyloid-beta peptides and phosphorylation of tau. We hypothesize that this smoldering
axonal degeneration late after TBI presents both a driver of and a substrate pool for TReND pathology
and associated AD/ADRD outcomes. We have also found that TBI induces a tau astrogliopathy with similarity
to aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) but with a pattern and distribution that is distinct from that seen in
aging and AD/ADRD and may demand reappraisal of current understanding of tau pathology in CTE-NC. Finally,
preliminary data indicate that females with TBI have more extensive DAI than males, suggesting there are sex-
based differences in evolution of axonal pathology. It is important to note that for this proposal we will leverage
the unique and unrivalled clinical datasets and tissue archives of CONNECT-TBI, an NIH U54-supported Center
Without Walls, which emerged from the current grant cycle. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Document the extent
and distribution of axonal degeneration and repair following all severities of and survivals from TBI; 2)
Characterize the extent, distribution and progression of axonal pathology and its association with TReND; 3)
Document the time course and distribution of the complex astroglial and microglial neuroinflammatory responses
following TBI and their relation to ongoing axonal degeneration, white matter atrophy and the pathologies of
TReND and AD/ADRD; and 4) Identify sex-associated differences in axonal morphology and the distribution and
progression of axonal and related TReND pathologies following TBI."
10766748,"Summary
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and death. Despite the progress in unraveling
the genetic basis of DCM, there is a lack of disease-modifying therapies that target the underlying genetic
etiology. In preliminary studies, we identified the transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as a potential target for therapeutic
interventions in genetic DCM. ATF4 is a critical factor mediating the integrated stress response; an adaptive
pathway activated in response to stress. ATF4 is selectively translated in response to specific forms of cellular
stress to induce the expression of genes involved in adaptation to stress. Here we propose a multidisciplinary
approach to explore the potential role of ATF4-mediated regulation of one-carbon metabolism in cardiac
physiology and develop novel mutation-agnostic gene therapy for DCM. In Aim 1, we will test whether ATF4
overexpression can rescue the contractility deficit, a hallmark of DCM, in a mutation-agnostic manner using
iPSC-CMs derived for patients carrying DCM-causing mutation in diverse gene ontologies. In Aim 2, we will
examine the potential role of ATF4-mediated regulation of one-carbon metabolism gene expression in
cardiomyocyte function. In Aim 3, we will use AAV-mediated overexpression of ATF4 in vivo and test whether
ATF4 signaling could reverse or halt the progression of DCM in vivo. Unlike conventional gene therapies, our
approach does not replace a faulty or missing gene. Instead, our approach aims at triggering a cardioprotective
effect by bolstering the ATF4-dependent one-carbon metabolism gene expression in the heart. We hope to
provide proof-of-concept for a new clinically relevant therapeutic strategy, paving the way for mutation-agnostic
treatments for genetic DCM. Such treatments are likely to apply to other types of cardiac diseases such as heart
failure."

The discovery of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like
receptors (NLRs) has led to the investigation of molecular agonists of innate immunity in adjuvant formulations.
An emerging paradigm is that careful selection of adjuvant combinations can result in complementary and even
synergistic enhancement of vaccine-induced immune responses. Most combination adjuvants under
investigation are chemically heterogeneous mixtures of depot adjuvants mixed with PRR agonists and suffer
from batch-to-batch variability and poor chemical definition making investigation of mechanisms and safety a
challenge. Our lab investigates self-assembling peptide nanofibers (PNFs) as vaccine adjuvants. A key
advantage of PNFs over emulsion adjuvants is that the primary sequence of the self-associating peptide can be
designed to control the physicochemical features of PNFs such as morphology, charge, chirality, or
hydrophobicity, which are key contributors to adjuvant activity. Mechanistic insights into the mode of action
indicates that unlike PAMPs, PNFs do not cause DC maturation but facilitate the release of DAMPs related to
osmotic/oxidative stress. In this application, we propose to develop combination adjuvants composed of
chemically defined DAMP-inducing peptide nanofibers (PNFs) and TLR2/NOD2 agonists.
Our objectives are to understand how molecular mechanisms of DAMP-inducing PNFs and PRR agonists
orchestrate innate immune signaling and induce responses that are complimentary, synergistic, or inhibitory for
balancing immunogenicity with safety. In aim 1, we will examine the effect of PNFs with varying physicochemical
properties and TLR2 or NOD2 agonist combinations on DC activation, DAMP release, and antigen presentation.
In aim 2, using a design of experiments (DOE) approach, we will develop an optimal formulation with precisely
controlled PNF-TLR2 and PNF-NOD2 combinations and determine the molecular mechanisms of innate
immunity in DCs using various KO mouse models. In aim 3, we will validate the efficacy of PNF-TLR2-NOD2
combination adjuvants and investigate translational potential using human DCs.
Outcomes of the proposed studies will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate
innate immune responses to PNF-PRR agonist adjuvant combinations and will lead to new combinatorial-
adjuvant platforms for combating infectious and non-infectious diseases with high translational potential."
10840949,"Project Summary / Abstract
Atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) are a rare but devastating side effect of long-term bisphosphonate (BP)
treatment. Despite the relatively low prevalence of AFFs, public awareness has considerably depressed
osteoporosis medication adherence. The mechanisms driving BP associated AFFs remain elusive and several
mechanisms have been proposed, including impaired bone remodeling, altered bone matrix maturation, and
the accumulation of tissue microdamage. A critical barrier to understanding how BPs negatively affect skeletal
integrity is the difficulty in separating the individual contributions of altered remodeling kinetics (suppressed
resorption and formation) from bone matrix maturation. We will overcome this barrier with our recently
validated rat model of induced cortical remodeling to investigate mechanism and treatment, based on robust
preliminary work in the laboratories of the three multiPIs. The current proposal, submitted in response to a
notice of special interest on AFF pathophysiology (NOT-AR-21-006), will test the central hypothesis that BPs
degrade skeletal integrity by affecting both the initiation of bone formation and matrix maturation. In Aims 1 and
2, we will focus on alendronate because of its strong association with the development of AFFs and raloxifene
as a potential mitigating treatment due to its reported positive effects on both the formation and matrix
maturation processes. Specifically, we will investigate the effects of alendronate and raloxifene on the initiation
of bone formation, concentrating on the role of reversal cells (Aim 1) and the remodeling independent effects of
these two drugs on matrix maturation and fatigue life (Aim 2). To determine if BP molecular structure could
play a role in AFF susceptibility, we will also compare how alendronate, zoledronate, risedronate, and
ibandronate affect bone formation, matrix maturation, and fatigue life (Aim 3). We will utilize an innovative
preclinical model and leverage the expertise of a highly qualified research team to address critical questions
associated with AFFs. If successful, the project will (i) further the understanding of the consequences of BP
usage on the skeleton by disentangling bone formation initiation and matrix maturation, identifying factors that
contribute to BP-induced loss of fatigue life and (ii) examine raloxifene as a novel rapid treatment option for
patients at risk for BP-induced AFF."

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common type of primary brain tumor, with a five-year survival rate
of only 5.5%. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown safety but limited efficacy in the
treatment of patients with GBM to date. GBM is characterized by dramatic antigen heterogeneity, thus
immunotherapy targeting any single antigen is unlikely to achieve complete and durable response. In addition,
GBM cells and surrounding tumor stroma overproduce transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which not only
promotes tumor growth and metastasis, but also actively modulate the immune response by suppressing T-cell
function and recruiting suppressive myeloid cells. Our analysis of patient GBM biopsies further confirmed that
tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) express both TGF-β and TGF-β receptors, indicating the presence of an
immunosuppressive feedback loop in the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we aim to develop a multi-
pronged immunotherapy featuring bispecific CAR-T cells that can not only attack GBM directly, but also modify
the TME to overcome immunosuppression and induce multiclonal immune responses against GBM.
 Our group has developed a bispecific CAR that can directly target GBM cells through recognition of IL-
13Rα2, a clinically validated GBM-associated surface antigen, while simultaneously converting TGF-β into a
stimulant for the engineered T cells. We have demonstrated that bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells are
superior to single-input IL-13Rα2 CAR-T cells in both human GBM xenograft and immunocompetent mouse
models. Here, we aim to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells for clinical
translation. In addition to demonstrating clearance of IL-13Rα2+ GBM, we will explore the potential for IL-
13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells to induce endogenous immune response against IL-13Rα2– tumor cells using mouse
models of heterogenous GBM. We will perform in-depth analyses by flow cytometry, multiplexed immuno-
fluorescence, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), and single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the impact of
bispecific CAR-T cells on the immune composition and function in the GBM TME. We will also perform T-cell
receptor beta (TCRβ) sequencing on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to quantify the potential for epitope spreading.
 We will perform rigorous safety evaluations in immunocompetent mouse models, applying worst-case
scenario pressure tests to explore the toxicity profile of IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells. Finally, we will verify
efficacy of IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cell therapy in heterogeneous human gliomas ex vivo & in vivo, using both
fresh patient GBM biopsies containing TIMs and GliomaPDOX models—i.e., mice bearing patient-derived GBM
tumors that have never been passaged ex vivo and retain the genetic heterogeneity seen in human patients.
Successful completion of this project will generate a comprehensive set of preclinical data in support of a phase-
1 clinical trial to treat GBM patients with this novel, multi-pronged immunotherapy option."
10929937,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Substance use disorder (SUD) treatment availability and use remain low despite an
ongoing drug overdose epidemic in the United States. In 2019, 19.3 million non-institutionalized adults met the
criteria for SUD, but only 2.6 million received specialty treatment services. People referred to SUD treatment
through the criminal legal system are less likely to receive evidence-based services (e.g., medication for opioid
use disorder) than those who self-refer to specialty treatment. Because racial/ethnic minoritized groups are more
likely to be criminalized than their white counterparts, as are men versus women, criminal-legal-system-based
referrals may contribute to racialized and gendered inequities in SUD treatment use and outcomes. Substantial
knowledge gaps remain about how the criminal legal system, specifically county-level incarceration, affects
community-level SUD treatment need, availability, use, and related outcomes. These gaps are exacerbated by
the siloing of healthcare delivery system and criminal legal system data. To fill these gaps, we will link
comprehensive multi-level data from counties in all 50 states from 2004-2023. We will quantify how county jail
and prison incarceration rates are associated with: (Aim 1) community SUD treatment need (drug-related
mortality rate, drug-related emergency department visit rate, SUD prevalence); (Aim 2) SUD treatment
availability (number and types of available treatment services); and (Aim 3) SUD treatment use (self-reported,
admission rates) and treatment outcomes (completion, retention) across communities and individuals. We
hypothesize that greater county incarceration is associated with greater SUD treatment need (and vice versa),
lower treatment availability, smaller increases in treatment use, and worse treatment outcomes. We anticipate
that these relationships will have important spatial dependencies and be modified by race/ethnicity and gender.
Our hypothesized pathways are grounded in the Socio-Cultural Framework for the Study of Health Service
Disparities; our research process is informed by Public Health Critical Race Praxis and the CDC Policy Analytical
Framework adapted for systems thinking. Our team, led by an Early-Stage Investigator, has expertise in
substance use epidemiology and treatment, criminology, criminal legal systems, health policy and health
systems, structural discrimination, minoritized populations, biostatistics, and spatial methods. We will apply this
expertise to study the criminal legal system, focusing on modifiable reform targets that can perpetuate and
worsen inequities in SUD treatment over time. Our study addresses NIDA’s Notice of Special Interest (NOT-DA-
19-037) calling for multi-level health services research on SUD treatment for vulnerable populations. By
leveraging multi-level data sources and engaging with stakeholders, this innovative R01 examines how multiple
systems converge to affect community health. We will incorporate experts and people with lived experience in
the research process. Our multi-pronged dissemination plan will ensure that findings reach target audiences and
inform antiracist health policies and programs that improve community-based SUD treatment-related outcomes."
10903822,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Osteoarthritis (OA), the leading cause of disability among adults, is without a cure and is associated
with significant comorbidities. OA ranks as the third most common diagnosis for hospital inpatient stays
with 1.25 M per year, with the knee the most commonly affected weight-bearing joint. We address
knee OA disease prevention in adult females because prevention of OA is preferable to treatment,
females are affected at nearly twice the rate as males, and to date interventions designed to slow or
stop knee OA progression have failed. Dietary weight loss, with and without exercise, has level 1
evidence of effective treatment for adults with knee OA and overweight and obesity. Reduced
degenerative cartilage changes are also associated with weight loss, making it a possible preventive
therapy for people at risk for knee OA. The objective of this Phase III, multi-site (Boston, MA, Chapel
Hill, NC, Broward County, FL, Sydney, Australia, and Winston-Salem, NC) randomized clinical trial is to
establish the efficacy of an intervention of dietary weight loss, exercise, and weight-loss maintenance
for knee OA prevention. We will establish efficacy in structural, symptomatic, and mechanistic
outcomes compared to attention control, and determine the cost-effectiveness of this non-
pharmacologic, non-surgical intervention in preventing incident knee OA in adult females aged ≥ 50
years with obesity and no or infrequent knee pain, a cohort at high risk for knee OA.
 Participants will be 1,230 ambulatory, community dwelling females with obesity (BMI ≥ 30
kg/m2), and aged ≥ 50 years. Structural and symptomatic eligibility will be determined at the individual
knee level. The eligible knee will have no radiographic (Kellgren Lawrence (KL) score ≤ 1) and no MRI
knee OA with no or infrequent knee pain (< 15 days/month) in the same knee. The primary aim is to
compare the effects of a 48-month intervention of dietary weight loss, exercise, and weight-loss
maintenance to an attention control group in preventing the development of structural (MRI) knee OA
using the MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS). Secondary aims will determine the intervention effects on the
Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS total), KOOS pain, mobility (6 minute walk
distance), and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Mechanistic secondary outcomes include knee joint
compressive forces as a measure of joint loading, IL-6 as an inflammatory measure, and weight loss
and exercise self-efficacy. We will also establish the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.
 This study is significant in that it will test a critically needed primary prevention intervention of
dietary weight loss, exercise, and weight-loss maintenance for females at risk for knee OA."

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, seeking new
therapeutic approaches is still the priority in the field. Recent studies have shown that stimulation of lymphatic
growth (lymphangiogenesis) after ischemic heart disease improves cardiac function and attenuates adverse
cardiac remodeling, and cardiac lymphangiogenesis likely improves heart repair after injury by improving the
clearance of inflammatory response. Furthermore, my published work has unraveled a novel additional
mechanism that an “active”, pro-survival paracrine signaling (lymphoangiocrine, Reelin) from lymphatic
endothelial cells promotes cardiomyocyte (CM) survival after injury, a result challenging the traditional view that
lymphatics function as a “passive” route for fluid transport. However, the detailed mechanism/s by which
increased lymphangiogenesis improves heart repair is not yet fully understood. Our exciting preliminary data
suggest that lymphangiogenesis improves cardiac repair requires both, cardioprotective lymphoangiocrine
signals and efficient lymphatic immune clearance function. This proposal is set out to use a various valuable
animal models to determine these functional roles of cardiac lymphangiogenesis during cardiac repair. In the
Aim 1 of the proposal, we will determine the molecular pathways and targets how cardiac lymphangiogenesis
improve CM survival after MI. In the Aim 2 of this proposal, we aim to use a variety of lymphatic loss- and gain-
of function mouse strains to characterize in details the lymphatic functions during cardiac repair, and determine
the therapeutic potential of these optimal effects in treatment of ischemic disease. These fundamental findings
will impact diverse fields including lymphatic biology and cardiovascular research, with an ultimate goal to
identify novel targets for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."
10756536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The clinical treatment of limb threatening injuries requires complex surgical management and a lifetime
of corrective surgeries and physical therapy. Advancements in the treatment of complex lower extremity trauma
with composite tissue loss are hindered by the lack of available therapies that can functionally repair both muscle
and adjacent bone. As a result of limited treatment options, composite injuries involving open bone fractures with
concomitant soft tissue co-morbidities, are 4-5 times more likely to result in delayed or failed bone union. There
is an unmet clinical need for regenerative approaches that can guide and restore the functional biophysical
relationship within and between both tissues.
Our prior research has shown that spatial patterning cues from nanoscale extracellular matrices modulate
the cellular inflammatory phenotype, angiogenic potential, and skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have further
shown that when these patterned materials are combined with running exercise, that large volumetric muscle
injuries in mice can be regenerated and re-innervated comparable to native tissue. With emerging evidence of a
regenerative dependency of bone outcomes on muscle cells and secreted factors, control over the muscle
regenerative niche may be the key to improved bone and limb healing in the management of extremity trauma.
We believe that nanoscale spatial patterning cues from anisotropic fibrillar scaffolds will enhance the
regenerative potential of myogenic and osteogenic cells, leading to muscle and bone regeneration and functional
restoration. This proposal first examines these questions in vitro to identify the role that spatial patterning plays
in guiding cell fate specification of muscle and bone progenitors as well as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cells. These studies will define the biophysical relationship between nanoscale patterning and subcellular
regulation of tissue-specific cell phenotype. In parallel with these studies, paracrine regulation of osteogenesis
by myogenic cells will be characterized in vitro and in vivo in a novel mouse model of composite injury of the
tibia/tibialis anterior. Through the use of spatial patterning to enhance myogenesis, we aim to guide the crosstalk
that occurs between muscle and bone during injury and repair to impact adjacent bone healing. Furthermore,
physical rehabilitation is known to play a critical role in the successful physical recovery from lower extremity
trauma by improving blood flow to damaged tissues and increasing strength recovery through mechanical
loading. Our patterned scaffolds have been shown to synergistically work with exercise stimulation to improve
healing following muscle trauma. Therefore, we will couple patterned scaffolds with running exercise to enhance
local muscle and adjacent bone regeneration. Together, this body of work will establish a regeneratively robust
and innovative approach for the treatment of complex extremity trauma with composite tissue loss."
10822035,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (15-25 nt) that play a pivotal role in the regulation of protein
synthesis by modulating mRNA translation. miRNA expression, localization and secretion are closely
modulated in response to biological stimuli. These processes are often dysregulated in cancer resulting in
miRNA expression profiles that are unique to cancer type and stage. Apart from its utility in early cancer
detection, tumor miRNA profiling has been shown to improve patient survival when used in treatment response
monitoring. Recent liquid biopsy studies have demonstrated the utility of miRNAs as circulating biomarkers for
early cancer diagnosis and for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. However, existing
assays are not sensitive to the subtle changes in miRNA profiles and require prior knowledge of the
dysfunctional miRNAs. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be used for agnostic miRNA profiling,
there is a clear lack of a rapid, easily administrable NGS-based molecular diagnostic assay that efficiently
captures subtle changes in microRNA profiles during disease progression owing to the small size and scarcity
of miRNA in biological samples, particularly in biological fluids. In this application we propose to develop a
novel approach called miREALLY that directly converts miRNA to sequence-ready libraries in just two steps –
direct ligation of ClaretBio's proprietary adapters to miRNA, followed by a step that performs reverse-
transcription and library-amplification in a single reaction. The proof of concept work described here will identify
the ideal combination of reagents and enzymes that facilitate efficient library conversion, with metrics that
outperform current small-RNAseq methodologies. In Aim 2 we will further optimize the protocol and determine
the limit of detection and input range to expand the utility of the approach with biological samples using non-
small cell lung cancer as a model. Finally in Aim 3 we will leverage the unique design of the adapters for
targeted enrichment of miRNA – by designing splint adapters with sequence complementarity to the ends of a
specific miRNA from complex miRNA mixtures. This allows capture of a panel of known miRNA and their
variants in a single workflow, eliminating the need for additional targeted enrichment steps. Accomplishing the
aims described here would result in a robust miRNA NGS assay that not only enables global miRNA profiling
but also helps monitor changes to levels of specific miRNA biomarkers and their variants thereby improving our
understanding of intracellular and circulating miRNA biology and facilitating more precise disease diagnosis
and monitoring in the clinical setting."
10824338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In both humans and rodents, parental care is disturbed by exposure to environmental adversity, including low
resource conditions (i.e., poverty, scarcity). Maternal adversity is associated with compromised quality of mother-
infant attachment and increased adverse caregiving patterns (i.e., maltreatment, neglect), which disrupt brain
and behavioral development in the offspring. Importantly, maternal behavior is an intergenerational behavior, as
the quality of maternal care a female experiences influences the quality of care she will give her own offspring.
Indeed, clinical and preclinical research converge in showing that females with a history of early life adversity
within the context of the caregiver (i.e., abuse, maltreatment) mistreat their own offspring. However, the neural
changes associated with early life adversity-induced maladaptive maternal behavioral states remain poorly
understood. One potential pathway is the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, which originates in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA), is sensitive to early life stress, and is critically involved in reward-related processes-
including maternal behavior. Moreover, the functional integrity of the VTA and mesolimbic DA signaling play a
causal role in the adequate expression of maternal behavior. Thus, compromised activity of VTA DA neurons
induced by early adversity may interfere with reward-related processes necessary for maternal motivation and
responsiveness. However, little is known about the regulation of DA system function and its relation to caregiving
behaviors in postpartum rodents following early life adversity. To this end, I employed a well-characterized
manipulation based on creating an impoverished nesting environment during postpartum days (PD) 2-9 by
providing the rat dam with limited bedding and nesting (LBN) materials, which increases stress hormone (i.e.,
corticosterone- CORT) levels in the dam and pups and disrupts mother-infant interactions, thereby mimicking
the effects of a stressful environment in potentiating maltreatment/neglect in humans. I found increased negative
maternal behaviors directed at pups, impaired motivated maternal responses and blunted VTA DA neuron
activity at PD 9-10 in LBN-exposed dams. The overall goal of this proposal is to replicate my postdoctoral findings
of postpartum adversity (LBN) effects on maternal behavior and mesolimbic DA function in the dam (in my
independent lab) and extend them into an intergenerational examination of maternal behavior and mesolimbic
DA function in the adult female offspring, while testing a mechanistic role for pup increases in CORT. The
overarching hypothesis is that early life scarcity-adversity (LBN dam, PD 2-9) will induce impaired maternal
behavior/disrupted mother-infant interactions and mesolimbic DA downregulation (i.e., VTA hypoactivity) in the
adult female offspring in a CORT-dependent manner. I will test a mechanistic role for CORT by preventing the
atypical infant increase in pup CORT levels and assessing whether it can circumvent early adversity effects on
maternal behaviors and postpartum DA function in female offspring. In this way, I hope to provide insights into
dopaminergic mechanisms contributing to early-adversity induced changes in mother-infant attachment."

 The functional roles and molecular mechanisms of non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in human genetic disease
serve as promising new frontiers for establishing the foundation of future research directions and therapeutic
avenues for disorders that currently lack sufficient treatment options. The inborn metabolic disorder
phenylketonuria (PKU) has been considered to be caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)
gene, resulting in disruptions to its enzymatic activity and consequent accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood.
Our preliminary data demonstrated that the human lncRNA HULC is functionally conserved with mouse lncRNA
Pair. PKU patients harbor genomic variants of the HULC gene. Knockout of Pair leads to hypo-pigmentation,
growth retardation, progressive neurological symptoms, and seizures, which faithfully models human PKU.
Deletion of HULC in primary human hepatocytes leads to elevated cellular Phenylalanine, suggesting the
functional importance of HULC/Pair in PKU. We defined the RNA motifs of both HULC and Pair that are integral
to establishing lncRNA-enzyme interactions and designed peptide-tagged lncRNA mimics that restored the
enzymatic activity of PAH. Administration of HULC mimics in PKU mouse model successfully alleviated excess
phenylalanine levels in serum, providing mechanistic insight into the basis of inherited genetic diseases. The
proposed study seeks to establish long non-coding RNAs as important players in the initiation and progression
of inborn metabolic disorders and develop a lncRNA-based innovative approach for determining new strategies
to tackle the molecular basis of PKU.
 The central hypothesis is that the genetic mutation and deletion of lncRNA results in the enzymatic
deficiency of PAH, which could be alleviated through targeting therapies to enhance the protein stability and
enzymatic activity of PAH. Using iPS-differentiated hepatocytes derived from PKU patients, we will first
demonstrate the biological significance of HULC in the development and progression of PKU by addressing the
impact of common HULC mutations and assessing the correlations between mutations or deletions of HULC and
PKU symptoms. We will then elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated regulation of PAH
enzymatic activity. Finally, we will use the administration of liver-enriched lncRNA mimics and small molecule
agonists/antagonists to establish their mechanistic role in restoring impaired enzymatic function.
 The aforementioned research aims will not only elucidate the roles of lncRNAs in metabolic disorders,
but also illustrate the potential therapeutic value of lncRNA mimics and small molecule inhibitor-based medicine
in treating inborn genetic diseases. We anticipate that the results of this study will shift the current research and
clinical paradigm to incorporate the physiological and pathological aspects of non-coding genes and pave the
way for the development of future lncRNA-based medicines."

10784696,"ABSTRACT
Coronary plaques begin their progression in childhood, making their reversal an important clinical goal in
adulthood. The understanding of mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis regression has been understudied
compared to plaque progression. Atherosclerosis represents a failure to resolve the maladaptive immune
response that maintains plaque growth through the accumulation of pro-inflammatory immune cells.
 The central inflammatory cell in the plaque is the macrophage (Mø) in the activated state. We previously
showed that plaque regression in mouse models is characterized by the enrichment of Møs in the inflammation
resolving state (which we will refer to as proR-Møs). We have recently shown that these proR-Møs are required
for regression. We also have observed in regressing plaques increased numbers of inflammation dampening
CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which prevent the expansion of effector T cells and support proR-Mø functions.
Furthermore, our results point to Wnt-signaling and chemokine receptor CCR7 as key pathways associated with
a pro-resolving environment. We hypothesize that all of these factors play important roles in the reprogramming
of the plaque inflammatory milieu to enable inflammation tissue repair in the artery wall and thereby promote
atherosclerosis regression.
 The development of novel therapies for atherosclerosis must also take into account “real world” clinical
issues. Accumulating data now show that the majority of treated patients intermittently adhere to statins, which
increases their CAD risk. We hypothesize that epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages and their precursors
by IH through trained immunity mediates these adverse effects on atherosclerosis, further hindering inflammation
resolution and rendering plaques susceptible to accelerated disease and refractory to regression. We have
developed the following specific aims to investigate the factors and pathways that drive or hinder
inflammation resolution and plaque remodeling during atherosclerosis regression:
Aim 1: To study the regulation of the inflammation-resolving properties of plaque Møs by Wnt-signaling.
Aim 2: To determine the role of CCR7 in the resolution of atherosclerotic inflammation and plaque
regression.
Aim 3: To establish the mechanistic basis for increased coronary artery disease risk in patients with
intermittent statin adherence.
In summary, this proposal represents an exciting opportunity to continue to combine our collective expertises to
address crucial gaps in our knowledge of the resolution of inflammation in atherosclerosis."

 Since the year 2000, pancreatic cancer diagnosis has been on the rise with future projections
considering it to be the 2nd leading cause of cancer death by 2030. Furthermore, the majority of patients die
within 1 year of diagnosis due to a lack of early detection and early intervention, both of which limit therapy
options. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the major form of pancreatic cancer and a disorder of
oncogenic Kras. Turning off Kras mutants, including KrasG12D or KrasG12V is the key to curing PDAC. However,
there are no known inhibitors which directly target these two mutants. PDAC originates from acinar cells
through the acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) process. Upon acquisition of oncogenic Kras mutation, it
converts acinar cells to duct-like cells, which subsequently develop into cancer cells. Because 1) activating
Kras mutations are required for PDAC growth and maintenance; 2) ADM is the initial step of PDAC
development; 3) KrasG12D and KrasG12V in PDAC are undruggable; and 4) PDAC patients are diagnosed too
late, it is important to understand how KrasG12D regulates ADM and precancerous lesion formation. Acquiring
information pertaining to the ADM process and its regulation will provide groundwork for the identification of
biomarkers used for early detection, and drug targets for early intervention successfully reducing the death toll
of PDAC. We identified CCL9 as a new downstream target of KrasG12D in pancreas acini of ADM and
subsequent PanIN development. So far, little is known about CCL9 in physiological and pathological settings.
Gene amplification of CCL15, a human orthologue of CCL9, is present in human PDAC and is a predictor of
shorter survival. The goal of this proposal is to dissect the mechanisms and functions of KrasG12D/CCL9 axis on
PDAC initiation and tumor development. We will accomplish this goal with the following specific aims. 1. To
delineate the mechanisms of CCL9-induced PDAC initiation through ADM; 2. To evaluate the in vivo function
of CCL9 in KrasG12D-mediated PDAC initiation. Successful completion of these aims will reveal new functions of
CCL9 in PDAC initiation and growth, add new mechanistic insights into the early event of PDAC development,
and establish the essential groundwork for CCL15, the human orthologue of CCL9, as one of the biomarkers
for early detection and the new treatment strategies for early intervention in the clinic to fight PDAC death."

A total of 18.2 million people in the U.S. currently live with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD). Susceptibility to cardiometabolic diseases is highly variable, and currently no FDA-approved drugs
exist to treat NAFLD. Recent work suggests that cardiometabolic diseases share several genetic factors, and
our long-term goal is to reveal the complex interplay between genomic and non-genomic risk factors in the
development of disease to improve risk prediction and identify drug targets for repurposing to treat NAFLD.
In our first aim we will apply causal single and multiple causal mediation analysis in the UK Biobank to identify
intermediate or moderating endophenotypes that can serve as potential intervention targets for type 2 diabetes
and NAFLD. We provide a framework for precision phenotyping and quantify how much individual-level genetic
burden for disease can be reduced if one would intervene on intermediary endophenotypes. It may ultimately
enable clinicians to detect early departures from patient-specific baseline risk that, while themselves are still
asymptomatic, are predictive of the subsequent onset of disease symptoms.
Our second aim is to identify and validate drug targets for potential repurposing in NAFLD using genomic and
real-world data. We will identify candidate drug targets using two approaches: 1) instrumental variable analysis
using genetic instruments of the `druggable' genome (e.g., Mendelian Randomization analysis) and 2) a
computational gene expression signature-based approach based on the knowledge of drug activity and
disease pathophysiology. Predictive validity of drug efficacy for candidate drug targets will be assessed using
real-world data of 9.1 million Veterans in the Veterans Health Administration healthcare system, 3.6 million
patients in the Penn Medicine clinical data warehouse, and 3.5 million patients in the Vanderbilt Synthetic
Derivative. Long-term therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated using emulated target trials in NAFLD patients with
cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver transplant, and liver cancer as the primary treatment endpoint during
five years of follow-up. Short-term drug efficacy will be evaluated in healthy patients using self-controlled case
series analysis with change in alanine transferase as the primary outcome. It is anticipated that our genomics-
informed and pharmaco-epidemiological approach to drug repurposing will accelerate drug-discovery efforts
and lead to the use of existing agents to treat NAFLD with shortened drug development times."

Ovarian cancer (OC) causes ~14,000 deaths each year in the USA. While there have been advances in
treatment, progression is common and cure rates are low. In recent years, several trials have been done
testing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), either alone or in combination with other agents, largely in the
setting of recurrent disease. Overall response rates have been unimpressive. Biomarkers of response to ICB
therapy, such as mutational burden, neoantigen load, PD-L1 expression, and baseline T cell infiltration, are
associated with response to ICB therapy in many cancers and suggest that ICB therapy requires pre-existent
immunity for clinical effectiveness. Vaccines, while inefficient alone at shrinking tumor, can reliably generate
the necessary pre-existing immunity, including in most OC patients. In a prior NCI-funded grant (P50-
CA136393), we developed a folate receptor alpha (FR) targeting Th17-inducing vaccine that is effective at
generating Th17 T cell immunity in nearly all OC patients. The premise for developing the vaccine was based
on extensive work showing i) a reciprocal relationship between Th17 effectors and Tregs, ii) association of
increased IL-17 expression with improved overall survival, and iii) resistance of Th17 T cells to immune
suppression. A phase I clinical trial was conducted in which 19 advanced OC patients, in first remission, were
vaccinated. All patients demonstrated coordinated cellular and humoral immunity. Of 18 patients evaluable for
efficacy, 39% (7/18) remained recurrence-free at the time of data censoring, with a median follow-up of 49.2
months, a recurrence-free survival (RFS) superior to historical controls(<15%). Parallel murine modeling
demonstrated a unique mechanism in which Th17 T cell immunity coordinates otherwise inefficient Th1, Th2
and B cell immunity through myeloid recruitment and activation of antibody-dependent mechanisms in
macrophages and eosinophils. We observed that Th17 DC vaccination overcomes resistance to ICB therapy
by generating tumor-specific immunity, restructuring the tumor microenvironment, and preventing adaptive
resistance to ICB. Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of Th17-inducing DC vaccination and ICB
therapy may be an effective therapeutic approach in patients with recurrent OC. In specific Aim 1 we will
conduct a phase I/II clinical trial of the novel Th17-inducing DC vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab
(provided by Merck) in 32 OC patients in the setting of early disease recurrence. Primary outcome measures
will be safety and the rate of objective responses. Interrogation of baseline tumor features will be done for
biomarker identification. In Specific Aim 2 we will use well validated analytical tools to examine cellular and
humoral immune responses in tissue and the periphery following combination treatment to identify dominant
features of the immune response induced by treatment and whether they are correlate with clinical outcome
assessments. Mechanisms of resistance to therapy will be identified. If positive, a new treatment ICB
treatment paradigm will be established to improve the survival of women afflicted with advanced OC."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts about three million Americans every year. The highest
incidence of TBI occurs in adults aged 75 and older who have higher mortality and worse long-

been reported in various animal studies. Yet, the molecular and cellular mechanisms have only
been partially elucidated, and age specific TBI treatments are notably lacking. Our published
microbiome analysis (16S RNA gene sequencing) data revealed that aged mice post-TBI
demonstrate a greater loss of beneficial commensal gut bacteria and a higher rise in opportunistic
deleterious species in the compared to young adult TBI mice. This increase in gut dysbiosis
correlated with worse neurodegeneration and neurocognitive deficits in aged TBI mice. Of note
preliminary data reveals a significant decrease in the size of the impact lesion and an attenuation
of neurocognitive deficits with transfer of a healthy microbiome into young adult TBI mice via fecal
microbiome transplantations (FMT) Hence, Dr. Davis hypothesizes that the post-TBI placement
of a young microbiome into an aged mouse will attenuate neurodegeneration and neurocognitive
deficits. For the K99 phase of the proposed research, Dr. Davis will validate the findings via single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate the transcriptional profiles of microglia over the
course of injury in aged mice FMT treated post-TBI. He will also compare microbiome scRNA-seq
data to anatomic, neurocognitive, and pathologic outcome measures with quantitative MRI,
behavioral phenotyping, and histopathology. For the R00 phase of the proposed research, Dr.
Davis will utilize aged (80-weeks-old) germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice reconstituted with the SCFA-
producing bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrosolvens (B. fib) before TBI or sham injury. Mutant B.fib that
produces 10-fold less SCFA will be used as a control. A separate cohort of aged wild type
C57BL/6 mice will receive water containing SCFAs (butyrate, acetate, and propionate) vs. vehicle
after TBI. scRNAseq will be used to determine if targeted microbial replacement or SCFA dietary
supplementation can attenuate microglia activation. Anatomic, neurocognitive, and pathologic
outcome measures will be determined with MRI, behavioral phenotyping, and histopathology.
Together, this proposal will fill current gaps in geriatric TBI research by providing new insights into
the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to aging-associated differential TBI outcomes,
which can, in turn, pinpoint potential aging-specific TBI therapeutic targets, which are severely
lacking."

Pancreatic cancer is the most deadly disease in human malignancies and effective treatment
options are limited. Here, we hypothesize that Engrailed-1 (EN1), a neuro-development
transcription factor, plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis via
epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation. EN1 is a homeo-domain transcription factor, acting as
a transcriptional repressor via recruiting transcriptional repressive complexes. Our preliminary
data show that EN1 is highly expressed in metastasis-derived organoids and metastatic lesions
of pancreatic cancer mouse model. In addition, EN1 expression is associated with poor prognosis
and the squamous molecular subtype of pancreatic cancer. Here, we find that EN1 expression
endows aggressive characteristics to pancreatic cancer cells and induces the squamous-PDA
identity gene signature. Our data strongly suggest that EN1-mediated epigenetic alterations
create a new vulnerability for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Therefore, it is critical to identify the
underlying molecular mechanism by which EN1 regulates pancreatic epigenome and contributes
to PDA progression and metastasis. To address this, we will employ multi-orthogonal approaches
to understand the precise role of EN1 in PDA progression. Here, we propose 1) to determine the
role of EN1 in the pancreatic cancer epigenome, and 2) to determine the role of EN1 in pancreatic
cancer progression. The proposed study will provide a new insight how EN1-mediated epigenetic
alterations impact on aggressive traits of pancreatic cancer. This may open novel avenues for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer."

As animals locomote, they constantly coordinate activity between the rostral and caudal ends of the body. This
coordination relies on neurons in the spinal cord that send long ascending or descending axonal projections.
Although several studies have shown that ablation of these neurons leads to deficits in coordination, it is
largely unknown whether these long-range circuits are similar or different from local circuits. In recently
published data in larval zebrafish, we demonstrated that at least one genetically defined class of spinal
neurons, the V1 (En1+) population, changes its synaptic targets as its axon ascends in the spinal cord.
Specifically, V1 neurons form synaptic connections with motor neurons and other ventral horn neurons nearby,
but switch to inhibiting a dorsal horn sensory population at longer range. Here we propose to extend this
analysis to five additional sets of ventral horn neurons, the dI6, V0 excitatory and inhibitory, V2a, and V2b
populations. To create this large-scale circuit map, we use localized optogenetic activation of identified spinal
populations while carrying out whole-cell recording of identified potential postsynaptic partners. By translating
the optogenetic stimuli up and down the spinal cord, we can build a physiological map of the strength of the
synaptic connection at various rostrocaudal positions. Normalization of the synaptic charge transfer allows
comparisons across target populations, providing a comprehensive grid of connectivity among spinal neuron
classes at various rostrocaudal distances. We will then build a computational model of spinal cord connectivity
that reflects biological reality, as measured in these experiments. Using this model, we will test the
consequences of shifting synaptic connections in the rostrocaudal axis, in order to understand the logic of
spinal circuit organization. Finally, we will selectively ablate long-range or local V2a neurons to determine the
behavioral effects of long-range vs local projections. Together, these experiments will provide a circuit map of
genetically identified spinal neurons."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease of age that is associated
with formation of plaques and destruction of neurons in the brain, leading to severe memory loss and
behavioral changes. Unfortunately and despite intensive research, there is no effective treatment for AD. A
better understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the accumulation of toxic β-amyloid peptides and
formation of amyloid plaque in AD is likely to identify potential new therapeutic targets. Rigorous prior research
links the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system to the accelerated progression of AD. Experimental AD in mice
responds positively to reduction of IGF signaling through genetic means. Thus, deletion or knock-down of IGF-I
receptors or intracellular mediators of receptor-mediated signal transduction in AD mice has been shown to
reduce plaque formation in the brain and prevent/delay neurodegeneration and associated behavioral
changes. We hypothesize that deletion of a novel proteolytic enzyme (PAPP-A), which enhances IGF action
through cleavage of inhibitory IGF binding proteins, protects against AD-like pathology and behavior in mouse
models of AD. For this proposal, we will generate AD mice combined with PAPP-A gene deletion.
ATTPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (AD) mice express mutations associated with early-onset AD, and develop β-
amyloid deposits in brain by 6 to 7 months of age. Our established PAPP-A knock-out (KO) mice are crossed
with the AD mice to get mice heterozygous for PAPP-A with or without AD transgenes. These mice are then
crossed to get four genotypes for the study: Wild-type (WT), AD, PAPP-A KO, and AD/PAPP-A KO mice. Our
preliminary data establish feasibility.
Specific Aim 1. Determine the consequences of PAPP-A gene deletion on brain pathology in AD mice. At 6,
12, and 18 months of age, brains from WT, AD, PAPP-A KO and AD/PAPP-A KO mice will be analyzed for
amyloid plaque, β-amyloid oligopeptides, and reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. In addition, brain
IGF-I receptor activation and circulating PAPP-A in extracellular vesicles will be assessed.
Specific Aim 2. Assess how PAPP-A gene deletion impacts cognitive function in AD mice. At 6, 12, and 18
months of age, WT, AD, PAPP-A KO, and AD/PAPP-A KO mice will undergo behavioral testing using novel
object recognition and the Stone T-maze.
The proposed studies would be the first to generate and characterize a mouse model to study the role of
PAPP-A in AD. Demonstration that loss of PAPP-A expression impacts pathological changes and behavioral
consequences would support the development of novel neurodegenerative therapies based on targeted
inhibition of PAPP-A."

This K23 Career Development Award will prepare the applicant to launch her career as an independent investi-
gator with expertise in research at the intersection of implementation and mental health equity research, with a
specialization in legal settings that serve youth, consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 4. The University of
Illinois at Chicago (UIC), under the expert mentorship of Drs. Marc Atkins, Jaleel Abdul-Adil, Lisa Saldana, and
Greg Brown, is the ideal environment for the applicant’s career development. Faculty conduct extensive imple-
mentation research with the goal of promoting youth mental health equity and have strong connections to the
Chicago Department of Public Health and the NIH-funded UIC Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences.
Training goals include: (a) foundational mental health equity research, (b) advanced implementation research,
and (c) specialized training in suicide prevention research and practice. The research component of this appli-
cation was developed to complement the training goals and provide opportunities to execute and refine newly
developed skills. The research plan addresses the critical need to prevent suicide among youth in juvenile jus-
tice settings. Youth in juvenile detention centers experience suicidal ideation at higher rates than their peers,
and juvenile detention centers disproportionately serve African American and Black youth, a group experienc-
ing an increase in suicide attempts nationally. Aligned with the Zero Suicide model, the applicant will optimize
the clinical and implementation elements used within juvenile detention centers (i.e., screening, pathways of
care, and brief treatment of suicidality via the Safety Planning Intervention). As the applicant’s goal is to be-
come an expert in the implementation of a range of evidence-based practices for legal settings that serve
youth, studying suicide prevention, given its large research base of evidence-based practices and its complex
regulatory concerns, provides the ideal training platform. In Aim 1, formerly detained young adults (n=35) who
identify as Black will be interviewed to understand their lived experiences and identify key barriers to and facili-
tators of suicide prevention in juvenile detention. In Aim 2, using data from the applicant’s prior work and Aim
1, the applicant will refine the Zero Suicide clinical elements for detention to ensure they are culturally respon-
sive and contextually appropriate and select and operationalize the implementation elements. In Aim 3, the ap-
plicant will pilot the feasibility of the Zero Suicide model and R01 method in two local detention centers using a
stepped wedge design and a convergent mixed method. The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of the clinical
and implementation elements as well as the recruitment, retention, and data collection procedures. This project
will provide the necessary data and skills for the applicant’s future R01 hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementa-
tion trial of the Zero Suicide model for juvenile detention. The timing of this proposed study is critical. Prevent-
ing youth suicide is a national priority, and NIMH has pledged to reduce the suicide rate by 20% by 2025 and
has a special interest in research on risk and prevention of Black youth suicide (NOT-MH-20-055)."

 Obesity, which is defined as the excess accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) is associated with the
development of numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular derangements. However, it is the
accumulation of visceral adipose (VWAT) that is associated with metabolic diseases, while the accumulation of
subcutaneous adipose (SWAT) is thought to protect against the development of obesity-associated disease. Sex
hormones are known to influence both the accumulation of adipose, adipose distribution between VWAT and
subcutaneous adipose (SWAT), and the development of metabolic disease, but the precise mechanisms by which
sex hormones influence adipose function and distribution remain unclear.
 We have previously shown that there is an obesity-specific mechanism of adipogenesis that drives adipocyte
hyperplasia in a sex-specific pattern. Estrogen plays a role in this process, where exogenous estrogen drives a
female-like patterning (both VWAT and SWAT) of adipocyte hyperplasia in male mice, while the absence of systemic
estrogen in female mice results in male-like patterning (VWAT only response). Our preliminary data indicates that in
the absence of systemic estrogen, estrogen signaling still plays a direct role in VWAT adipocyte hyperplasia at the
onset of obesity. We show here that it is VWAT endothelial cells that express aromatase and thereby produce the
estrogen required for adipocyte hyperplasia in males and ovariectomized females. We propose that aromatase
expression in VWAT endothelium is controlled by glucocorticoids, linking the VWAT-specific actions of estrogen to
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that estrogen and
glucocorticoids participate in an endothelial cell-adipocyte precursor axis that regulates obesogenic adipogenesis,
thereby influencing distribution of WAT and impacting metabolic disease. Here we will establish the role of adipose-
produced estrogen in obesity and metabolic disease, determine the mechanisms that regulate aromatase in VWAT
endothelial cells and define the molecular mechanisms of that regulate estrogen action in adipocyte precursors."

Intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) is a phosphate regulating hormone secreted by bone. In chronic
kidney disease (CKD), increased Fgf23 transcription is associated with cardiovascular mortality, disturbed iron
metabolism and anemia. Fgf23 transcription is physiologically coupled to FGF23 cleavage by Furin resulting in
secretion of iFGF23, carboxy terminal (Cter) and amino terminal (Nter) FGF23 peptides. The well-established
function of iFGF23 is to maintain normal phosphate homeostasis by targeting the kidney but there is emerging
evidence supporting extra-renal FGF23 targets which might be the result of increased Cter- and Nter-FGF23
signaling. Novel approaches to reduce FGF23-associated adverse outcomes in CKD are desperately needed
but current therapies are suboptimal due to lack of understanding of the role of FGF23 peptides.
In preliminary data we show that in addition to iFGF23, FGF23 peptides are secreted by bone and extraosseous
sources, including erythroid cells, in CKD. We also show that these peptides display novel physiological
functions. Cter-FGF23 peptides suppress the secretion of the hepatic iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin, leading
to increased circulating iron. Nter-FGF23 peptides are not released in the circulation when FGF23 is expressed
in bone, but in iron deficient animals and patients and mice with CKD, FGF23 production by erythroid cells
contribute to increased circulating Nter-FGF23 levels. When elevated, Nter-FGF23 reduces the secretion of
erythropoietin, inhibits erythropoiesis and induces left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). These observations support
important new roles of FGF23 peptides, and a functional role for the coupled regulation of Fgf23 transcription
and iFGF23 cleavage. In Aim 1, we will establish the physiological and pathological role of Cter-FGF23 peptides
in iron metabolism. Using multiple genetic mouse models, we will delete and overexpress Fgf23 and Cter-Fgf23
in bone, to test whether Cter-FGF23 peptides generated from increased FGF23 cleavage, protect mice against
overt hypoferremia by uniquely limiting hepcidin secretion in models of high (inflammation and iron overload) or
low (iron deficiency) endogenous hepcidin and compare these effects to exogenous hepcidin administration. We
will further test the therapeutic potential of genetic and pharmacologic Cter-FGF23 supplementation in two
mouse models of CKD and assess the onset and development of iron deficiency anemia. In Aim 2, we will use
the genetic overexpression and pharmacologic administration of FGF23 and Nter-FGF23 in osteocytes and
erythroid cells, in vivo and in vitro, to investigate the direct role of iFGF23, Nter-FGF23 and FGFR signaling in
the inhibition of erythropoiesis, and their indirect role by regulating erythropoietin (EPO) production in kidney and
liver. We will further investigate whether erythroid-produced Nter-FGF23 peptides contribute to LVH in mice with
CKD and test the direct hypertrophic effects of Nter-FGF23 in cardiomyocytes cultures. This project will
contribute to new insights into the molecular functions of FGF23 and support our ultimate goal of developing
novel therapeutic approaches to improve adverse outcomes associated with excess FGF23."

Children with proteinuric glomerulopathies are at considerable risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition to the
high prevalence of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population, more than half of children
with proteinuric glomerulopathies experience nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation, defined by nocturnal
hypertension or a reduced decline in nocturnal blood pressure (non-dipping pattern). Nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation is independently associated with poor cardiovascular disease outcomes in adults. In this context,
the objective of this proposal is to understand the cardiovascular disease risks, clinical predictors and molecular
markers associated with nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation in children with proteinuric glomerulopathies.
The central hypothesis is that nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation is independently associated with
progression of cardiovascular target organ damage over time in children with proteinuric glomerulopathies. It is
further hypothesized that clinical and molecular markers will be associated with the nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation phenotype. The specific aims of this proposal are: (Aim 1) To determine how nocturnal blood
pressure dysregulation associates with target organ damage over time in children with proteinuric
glomerulopathies; (Aim 2) To identify sleep- and circadian-related predictors of nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation in children with proteinuric glomerulopathies; (Aim 3) To investigate molecular pathways, networks
and metabolic alterations associated with nocturnal blood pressure dysregulation in children with proteinuric
glomerulopathies using multi-omic data integration
. The proposed study will investigate nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation in a multi-center, longitudinal observational study of 120 children with proteinuric glomerulopathies
enrolled from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) and Cure Glomerulonephropathy Network
(CureGN). Cardiovascular measures will be followed for three years to determine how the nocturnal BP
dysregulation phenotype associates with progression of cardiovascular target organ damage. Predictive models
will then be developed using machine learning methods to identify the clinical predictors of nocturnal blood
pressure dysregulation, with a particular emphasis on sleep- and circadian-related predictors. Further, a
precision medicine approach will be employed to define molecular markers of nocturnal blood pressure
dysregulation using multi-omic data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) integration. To this
end, identifying the health risks, clinical predictors and molecular markers associated with nocturnal blood
pressure dysregulation among children with proteinuric glomerulopathies using innovative bioinformatics
approaches to analyze existing and novel data will fill a significant knowledge gap for a population of children at
great cardiovascular risk. This study will ultimately guide prevention and treatment to meaningfully improve
cardiovascular disease outcomes in these children with proteinuric glomerulopathies."

Dual neurotransmission has the potential to transform the way we consider neuronal signaling and the
transmission of information within circuits and networks. The importance of dual transmission is evident by
the large and increasing number of identified dual transmitting neurons in every system. However we still
have only limited insight into the regulation and functional effects of co-transmission. During our previous
funding period, we established: 1) the majority of octopamine (OA, the invertebrate analogue of
norepinephrine), neurons co-express glutamate, 2) OA and glutamate have overlapping, as well as distinct,
roles in reproductive and aggressive behaviors, and 3) manipulation of a glutamate-OA neuronal subset leads
to high intensity aggression. Although aggression is a critical component of social behavior observed across
species, when expressed at elevated levels aggression in humans can threaten lives and incur economic
burdens on society. Given the importance of maintaining a critical balance of aggression and
understanding the implications of dual transmission signaling in general, in this proposal we are
identifying the molecular and physiological mechanisms that constrain aggression as well as
dynamically regulate the release of co-transmitters. Leveraging our deep understanding of aggression-
promoting neurons, genetic tools, and functional imaging, we will test our hypothesis in three specific aims.
First, using fluorescent biosensors to visualize neurotransmitter release and Ca2+ imaging to quantify neuron
activity, we will test the hypothesis that glutamatergic and adrenergic receptors expressed by glutamate-OA
neurons are required for the regulation of co-transmission. Second, using epitope-tagged vesicular
transporters and antibodies we will test the hypothesis that sexually dimorphic glutamate-OA neurons exhibit
dynamic age-related changes in VGLUT levels. Finally, we will determine if VMAT-VGLUT terminal
phenotypes are dependent on external cues from postsynaptic neurons. The significance of our study is that
it addresses a fundamental neuroscience question, namely the molecular and potentially sexually dimorphic
regulation of the dual transmission phenomenon, as well as potentially leading to the targeting of the
glutamatergic system within glutamate-monoamine neurons as a therapeutic strategy for unchecked
aggression."
10773126,"Bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer per capita to treat in the US. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC) which accounts for 70-75% of all newly diagnosed tumors and has only a single FDA approved first-
line treatment option, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). BCG has been the only approved first-line therapy for
intermediate and high-risk NMIBC for more than 40 years. While BCG can induce durable responses, ~50% of
patients have recurrence or progression of their disease. The current dosing of BCG is arbitrary with no data
currently available to support the dosage, strain nor regimen. Furthermore, no clear mechanism of action behind
BCG’s anti-neoplastic activity in NMIBC has been delineated. Better understanding of the immune response
initiated by exposure to BCG and how such response is sustained over many repeated doses is essential to help
improve its therapeutic action. Further, it may lead to discovery of predictive biomarkers and novel targets leading
to advance care for patients, reduce the financial burden associated with the disease, and improve access to
BCG. Our preliminary data have identified a significant Type-1 cytokine response to BCG in all patients inducing
an activation and recruitment of IFN-g producing NKG2A+ natural killer (NK) cells and NKG2A+PD-1+ CD8 T cells
to the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our preliminary analyses of post-BCG-treated specimens demonstrate
IFN-g signaling as the most upregulated signature in BCG resistant specimens and strongly correlates with
increased HLA-E and PD-L1 expression on the recurring tumors. Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A) is a novel
therapeutic target and is currently in clinical trials across several cancer types. A role for NKG2A/HLA-E alone
or in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 in regulating NK and CD8 T cells remains elusive with virtually nothing known
in bladder cancer. Our hypothesis is that chronic activation from repeated exposures to BCG drives immune
dysregulation followed by functional exhaustion in a significant proportion of patients, which then leads to disease
recurrence or progression. The immune dysregulation in the TME is driven by NKG2A/PD-1 on CD8 T cells,
NKG2A on NK cells and HLA-E and PD-L1 on tumor cells. To further validate our findings and better understand
BCG mechanisms we will study the following aims: Aim 1: To analyze intratumoral NK cells and T cells and their
interactions with tumors in response to BCG therapy. We will test the hypothesis that upregulated expression of
HLA-E and PD-L1 on recurring tumors are directly in contact with infiltrating NKG2A+ NK and NKG2A+ PD-1+
CD8 T cells. Aim 2: To longitudinally assess blood and tumor phenotypes and functions in response to BCG
therapy. We will test the hypothesis that repeated exposures to BCG drives prolonged activation and
dysregulation of NKG2A+ NK and NKG2A+ PD-1+ CD8 T cells. Aim 3: To determine the effects of combination
PD-L1 and NKG2A blockade on anti-tumor immunity. We will test the hypothesis that NKG2A+ NK and NKG2A+
PD-1+ CD8 T cells can be functionally restored through use of PD-L1 and NKG2A combination blockade."

Pediatric Crohn's disease presents as a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract,
leading to malabsorption, anemia, and psychosocial decline. The incidence rate of Crohn's disease has been
growing in the 10- to 18-year age group. Crohn’s disease exists on a spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from
mild disease responsive to standard anti-TNFɑ therapy to severe, treatment-resistant disease with stricturing
(B2) or penetrating (B3) complications often requiring surgical intervention. Distinguishing which patients will
progress to more severe disease from patients who will require minimal intervention at the time of diagnosis is
an urgent unmet need. Accurate and automated prediction of disease outcomes will significantly improve patient
health by informing personalized interventions for individual patients. Previous attempts at generating predictive
models of Crohn’s disease relying solely on clinical features of the disease and patient biodata have
demonstrated promising, yet inadequate accuracies for clinical practice applications. This proposal addresses
these limitations by leveraging large cohorts of archival and prospective patient clinical metadata, ‘omics, and
machine learning derived tissue features to build and test machine learning models for predicting specific Crohn's
disease outcomes. In Aim 1, we will build, test, and validate predictive models of Crohn’s disease using
computational image analysis of gold-standard biopsy histopathology slides. We will use saliency maps and
gene correlations analysis to validate our models by visualizing the tissue features of importance to our predictive
models and identify specific transcriptomic changes associated with these features. In Aim 2, we will generate
a clinically-relevant predictive model of Crohn’s disease by integrating the deep features extracted from histology
image analysis with other patient metadata collected as part of standard clincal care. Additionally, we will collate
a thorough list of published predictive models of Crohn's disease to benchmark the performance of our proposed
and future predictive models. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use cutting edge single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial
transcriptomics approaches to elucidate a transcriptomic signature of Crohn's disease and characterize specific
genetic profiles associated with the hallmark morphological changes in diseased tissue. These data will provide
a framework for studying the subtypes and clinical outcomes of Crohn’s disease and other gastrointestinal
diseases, thus driving the clinical adaptation of personalized therapy and precision medicine. This proposed
research will increase the resolution of both diagnostic and prognostic information to better manage Crohn’s
disease in patients and significantly shft clinical management to an individualized treatment paradigm."

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction that induces a multitude of defects in immunity for sustained
periods of time after clinical recovery that is closely correlated with long-term mortality associated with septic
cardiomyopathy. Although immune-based therapies have been designed to suppress inflammatory responses,
this strategy alone has marginal benefits for sepsis patients, as the dominant molecular drivers of septic
cardiomyopathy-associated inflammation remain unclear. As our knowledge of mitochondria advances, we first
investigated a previously underappreciated activator in inflammation and disease progression, mitochondrial R-
loop (RNA:DNA hybrid) termed mtR-loop, and discovered aberrant accumulation in cardiomyocytes after sepsis.
The contributory role of mtR-loop toward cardiomyopathy post sepsis was documented in a pilot study showing
that unresolved mtR-loop is pathological, which is linked to not only mitochondrial genome instability, but also
unresolved chronic inflammation through activating both non-immune cells (cardiomyocytes) and immune cells
(macrophages). Most importantly, these cardiomyocyte-derived mtR-loop could translocate to extracellular
compartments and were sensed by macrophages in the heart to fuel a fata response to sepsis. This proposal
will test the hypothesis that septic cardiomyocyte derived mtR-loop are the central hub that connect various
pathways of the immune response in the inflammatory network. If identified, mtR-loop inhibition will be explored
as a potential novel cardio-protector against stress. To this, we will employ genetic tools combined with reporter
mice to monitor mtR-loop translocation within cells, track mtR-loop uptake by immune cells, define the
mechanism underlying mtR-loop intercellular communication and initiated inflammation, and characterize the
infiltrating cells. Mechanistically, our pilot data first showed that the SUMOlyation-dependent packaging of
lncRNA (lncRP11) into mitochondria, which hybrids with mtDNA to form mtR-loop (lncRNA:mtDNA structure).
Those lncRNA-associated mtR-loop acts an upstream trigger of inflammatory network in septic hearts. Based
on these initial findings, we hypothesize that suppression of lncRP11 transcription can reduce or prevent cardiac
dysfunction in post-sepsis by directly reversing or ameliorating inflammation associated with cardiomyocyte
failure. Specifically, by 3D genome mapping, the physical contact of enhancer and promoter, but not their
activities, was identified to regulate lncRP11 transcription in septic hearts. Interestingly, this is largely due to loss
of CTCF-mediated insulator between lncRP11 promoter and enhancer. In addition, the CTCF binding on the
insulator is sensitive to DNA methylation. Thus, we propose that gain of CTCF-mediated insulator by epigenetic
editing tool could block enhancer/promoter interaction and thus silence lncRP11 transcription. Results of these
studies will be used to develop a viable therapeutic approach using targeted epigenetic editing, which can
efficiently resolve lncRP11-associated pathological mtR-loop and thereby ameliorate stress-induced cardiac
damage and reduce the mortality and morbidity of patients with septic cardiomyopathy."

This academic-industrial partnership (AIP) proposal seeks to develop a robust and easy-to-use clinical scanner
for tumor oxygen measurement (oximetry) in cancer patients. By knowing quantitative tumor oxygen levels in
real time, radiotherapy could be better planned and delivered at times when there will be an optimal therapeutic
ratio, thus significantly improving cancer care. The proposed approach seeks to leverage the unique capabilities
of the in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry technology that we have developed for
measurement in human subjects into a medical device that is ready for routine clinical use. The scanner can
make direct and repeated measurements of tumor oxygen by typical end-users in a clinical setting. The EPR
research team at the Geisel School of Medicine (Dartmouth College) has successfully demonstrated the clinical
feasibility and safety of EPR oximetry for measuring tumor oxygen in the clinic, and now seeks to expand upon
that success through a collaborative partnership with ViewRay®, a medical-device company that is engaged in
MRI image-guided radiation therapy. The clinical scanner will be designed to make it easier to operate by clinical
staff and sufficiently robust and reliable for its intended use in a variety of clinical settings. The following specific
aims are proposed to achieve the overall objective of developing an advanced EPR scanner for oximetry that is
ready to be manufactured and used in routine clinical care to enhance cancer therapy: (Aim 1) Design and
construct a 600-MHz pulse EPR system for clinical oximetry; (Aim 2) Fabricate a new class of compact,
lightweight, and advanced resonator designs specifically optimized for pO2 measurements in human tumors;
(Aim 3) Develop hardware and software interface with advanced measurement capabilities and user-friendly
operation suitable for use in the clinic; (Aim 4) Assemble, test, and evaluate the scanner for repeated
measurements of oxygen concentration using tissue phantoms and animal models of tumor; and (Aim 5)
Evaluate the efficacy, usability, and safety of the oxygen scanner as a medical device and validate its use to
make oxygen measurements in cancer patients and human factors engineering. The EPR scanner, fully
integrated with the hardware and software modules, will be evaluated in relation to its ability to meet or exceed
regulatory standards and for its practicality as a clinical device. The new first-in-clinical scanner will be a very
valuable tool in the clinic for accurate prognosis and development of effective treatment strategies for cancer
therapy. It can also be a valuable clinical tool for other clinical conditions where tissue oxygen is a critical variable
for decision making, e.g., patients with diabetic peripheral vascular disease."

An interdisciplinary research team has been assembled, including biomedical engineers, neuroimaging
scientists, and computer scientists to conduct the proposed research and development. This application
will be valuable for exploring the interactions in astrocytic signaling, neuronal excitability and local
microvascular responses involved in mPFC function and in their changes elicited by cocaine. The broad
impact of this application will be to provide a tool to complement other neuroimaging modalities to measure
neuronal, astrocytic, and vascular aspects of brain function in awake animals."

 Migraine, a chronic intermittent headache disorder, ranks in the top five causes for years lived with
disability. Due to the high disability burden associated with migraine, individuals who experience migraine often

duration, and medication use. Recruitment, retention, and adherence to our study protocols were
demonstrated to be feasible and preliminary clinical outcomes were promising.
 Our long-term goal is to conduct a multi-site large-scale fully powered trial evaluating the effectiveness
of a validated multimodal chiropractic care intervention to reduce migraine frequency, severity, and disability.
However, several important knowledge gaps remain which need to be addressed before undertaking a large-
scale study. We need to: 1) recruit and train teams of chiropractors from established chiropractic care clinics,
refine our interventions, and assess fidelity of intervention protocols; 2) establish infrastructure in preparation
for a multi-site trial including coordinated institutional review board oversight, data sharing agreements, as well
as harmonized data collection and reporting procedures across sites; and 3) refine recruitment and retention
procedures across multiple settings, and to other groups, particularly men, who were not included in our pilot
study.
 To help inform the design of a large-scale trial with both pragmatic and explanatory features, we
propose to conduct a two-arm pilot randomized attention-controlled trial at two sites which are representative of
sites to be included in the future large-scale trial. We will recruit and randomize 60 individuals (30 per site) to
either 1) 14 visits of CC (6 visits of CC over 3 weeks followed by 8 visits of CC over 12 weeks); or 2) 14
sessions of headache health education (15-minute 1:1 virtual sessions focused on pre-defined migraine-
specific topics) – both added to usual medical care. This study will allow us to address the following aims: 1)
To train a team of chiropractors from established clinics within two academic medical centers with existing
partnerships with headache programs, refine our intervention, and assess fidelity of intervention protocols; 2)
To optimize data collection, data management, and reporting procedures across sites and establish the
infrastructure needed for a large-scale trial; 3) To assess the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and
adherence across multiple study sites; 4) To assess participant expectations and treatment experience."
10782493,"ABSTRACT. This REVISED collaborative R01 application addresses the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) on
the gastrointestinal mucosa in chronic HIV infection. We hypothesize that CMV infection contributes to the
intestinal barrier dysfunction and consequent immune activation that persist in chronic HIV infection despite
suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Aim 1, based on strong preliminary studies, we hypothesize that
CMV persistence in the gastrointestinal tract results in part from the failure of CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells to
localize to this tissue. To determine the breadth and functionality of CMV-specific T-cell responses in gut, we will
measure responses in colorectal tissue from participants in the SCOPE cohort at UCSF. To determine the effects
of CMV infection on antigen presentation in gut, we will employ the rhesus macaque model of CMV (RhCMV)
and SIVmac to study interactions between mucosal dendritic cells (DC) and T-cells ex vivo. In Aim 2, we will
leverage an externally-funded clinical trial (AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study #A5383) to directly test the
hypothesis that asymptomatic CMV replication contributes significantly to microbial translocation in treated HIV
disease. We will determine the effects of suppression of CMV replication with letermovir on systemic biomarkers
of microbial translocation as well as immune activation and gut barrier integrity assessed directly in gut mucosal
tissues. Taken together, these studies will determine the contributions of CMV to immune activation in HIV
disease, and the mechanistic bases for these effects. Aim 3 leverages a second ACTG study (#A5355) to
determine whether a modified vaccine Ankara (MVA)-based CMV vaccine can increase systemic and/or gut-
homing and mucosal CMV-specific T-cell responses in treated HIV infection. Failure of a therapeutic anti-CMV
vaccine to elicit gut-homing CMV-specific T-cell responses and to reduce mucosal CMV shedding may
compromise its ability to reduce systemic immune activation in treated HIV infection and would highlight the need
for optimization of vaccination strategies to improve mucosal responses. (Note: Aims 2 and 3 do not meet the
NIH definition of a clinical trial; the ancillary studies in these Aims only add additional measures to pre-existing
trials)."
10789895,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The number of women incarcerated in the United States has increased more than 600% over the past
three decades. At last count, more than 225,000 women – a majority of whom were of reproductive age – were
behind bars. As the number of incarcerated women has risen, so too has the need for prisons to address
women’s health needs, including pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. Providing incarcerated pregnant
women with enhanced pregnancy and postpartum supports may improve both maternal and neonatal
outcomes. One promising approach is to use doulas to provide this comprehensive support. As non-medical
companions, doulas provide an array of supports and have been shown to reduce labor length and obstetric
complications, improve maternal satisfaction, and promote breastfeeding initiation among low-income women.
Several state prisons are now partnering with local organizations to offer enhanced pregnancy and postpartum
support; yet, key questions that are critical to successful program expansion remain. The overall objective of
this project is to conduct a multi-state study of enhanced pregnancy and postpartum support programs for
women incarcerated in six geographically-diverse prisons, with the overall goal to provide valuable, practical,
and actionable information to prisons about how to implement pregnancy and postpartum support programs to
promote maternal and neonatal health. We will accomplish this goal by pursuing the three specific aims: 1)
identify facilitators and barriers to implementation of pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum support programs
for women in prison, 2) evaluate the pregnancy and birth outcomes of program participants, and 3) evaluate
the postpartum outcomes of program participants. Results from this study will fundamentally advance our
understanding of pregnancy and postpartum support programs and the maternal and neonatal outcomes
among program participants. Identifying key modifiable factors across prisons that facilitate program
implementation and sustainability and documenting the outcomes of participants across sites will directly
inform ongoing program expansion. Ultimately, this work will yield critical information to address the complex
health needs of pregnant women in prison, reduce health disparities, and promote health equity among justice-
involved women and their infants."
10731375,"Abstract
 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and insomnia are both more prevalent among Veterans than in the general
population. While insomnia is 3-9 times more prevalent in AUD than in the general population, patients with
comorbid AUD and insomnia suffer from higher severity of AUD with increased alcohol craving, reduced quality
of life, impaired interpersonal functioning, higher risks for suicidal behavior and relapse during early
abstinence. There are limited options to treat drinking behavior and insomnia due to side effect profile
(disulfiram) or only modest impact on drinking outcomes (naltrexone and acamprosate). Topiramate (TOP), an
FDA-approved medication for seizures and migraines, showed moderate effect sizes in achieving abstinence
and decreasing craving, when compared to placebo, in a recent meta-analysis. However, TOP therapy did not
provide clinical improvement in objective sleep or subjective insomnia. Furthermore, hypnotic medication
treatments with trazodone, gabapentin, and ramelteon have shown variable impact for sleep disturbance and
abstinence. By contrast, all four studies evaluating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) have
shown a large magnitude of effect for treating insomnia but with minimal to no effect on abstinence. Thus,
combining TOP and CBT-I will strengthen their recovery and improve their overall functioning. This
combination treatment will be the first personalized intervention in treating Veterans with AUD and comorbid
insomnia.
 A sample of treatment-seeking Veterans with AUD (N=174) will be initially treated with TOP 200 mg a
day for six weeks, and then randomized to receive either CBT-I (N=87) or Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE, a
behavioral placebo intervention) (N=87) weekly for the next eight weeks. We will conduct CBT-I following our
standard protocol using 30-minute sessions to deliver its components (Sleep Restriction, Stimulus Control,
Sleep Hygiene and Cognitive Therapy). A post-intervention visit will be conducted eight weeks after the
intervention phase. The primary outcome measure will be the Percent Days Abstinent (as computed from the
Time Line Follow Back interview) and the insomnia severity (as assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index).
Also, we will track other aspects of alcohol use, sleep and daily functioning using TLFB, PACS, sleep diaries,
BDI, and the STAI to test whether successful treatment of drinking and insomnia will be associated with better
clinical outcomes in AUD. It is hypothesized that in Veterans with AUD, the combination of TOP+CBT-I, as
compared to TOP+SHE group, will lead to 1) a more significant percentage of days abstinent from alcohol, and
2) superior sleep-related outcomes along with pre-post treatment effect sizes comparable to the meta-analytic
norms. If these hypotheses are supported, the findings will need to be validated in a larger multi-center trial. If
validated, the findings would support: 1) including insomnia treatment as a standard component of the initial
protocol for treating AUD comorbid with insomnia, and 2) using TOP+CBT-I combination treatment to manage
this subpopulation of AUD patients."

 The adrenal androgen precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS) are known
to contribute to fetal development and adrenarche. The role of adrenal androgens following puberty and
throughout adulthood has been poorly understood. The adrenal glands are also the source of unique 11-
oxygenated metabolites of androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T), collectively termed 11-oxyandrogens. Of
these, 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) and its 5α-reduced product, 11-ketodihydrotestosterone (11K-DHT), are
bioactive androgens, with potency equivalent to testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), respectively.
These 11-oxyandrogens are central to the pathophysiology of several disorders of androgen excess, including
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, premature adrenarche, or castration-resistant prostate cancer. The role of 11-
oxyandrogens during physiological aging is unknown. The traditional androgens androstenedione (A4) and
testosterone (T), which also derive from the gonads, as well as the major adrenal androgen precursors, DHEA
and DHEAS, decline with aging. Intriguingly, we have recently found that the production of 11-oxyandrogens
remains sustained in aging individuals of both sexes. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that 11KT is
associated inversely with bone degradation biomarkers, and directly with hemoglobin and hematocrit.
 The overall objectives of this application are: 1) to define the trends of circulating 11-oxyandrogens in
men and women throughout adulthood, with particular focus on aging; 2) to determine the implications of 11-
oxyandrogens on aging-related clinical outcomes, including bone, metabolic, and cardiovascular pathology; 3)
to define the bioactivity potential of 11-oxyandrogens. Three specific aims have been designed to address critical
gaps in our knowledge of adrenal androgen function throughout adulthood and aging. • In Aim 1, we will
characterize for the first time the longitudinal patterns of circulating 11-oxyandrogens in women, beginning with
reproductive stages, and following menopause. We will use mass spectrometry to quantify traditional sex-
steroids and 11-oxyandrogens in over 3,000 serum biospecimens from 569 women included in the Study of
Women Across the Nation (SWAN). • In Aim 2, we will test the working hypothesis that 11KT has direct
implications on bone and cardiovascular health. We will quantify an extensive set of steroids, including 11-
oxyandrogens, in over 2400 men and women, participants in the Dallas Heart Study (DSH). We will use the rich
datasets from both the SWAN and DHS, which include comprehensive health history and wellbeing survey
instruments (both studies), as well as laboratory and imaging evaluations of bone, metabolic, and cardiovascular
health (DHS). • In Aim 3, we will test the bioavailability of 11-oxyandrogens and their potential to be aromatized
to 11-oxyestrogens. Together, this work will reframe our understanding of bioactive androgens in human health
and disease."
10896141,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous and complex disorder and both genetic and environmental
factors are likely to be involved in its etiology. Hundreds of putative susceptibility genes for late-onset AD have
been reported, but the majority of these claims—with the exception of the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E
gene—have not been consistently replicated. Furthermore, the functional significance of the majority of the
positional candidate genes in AD pathogenesis is not clear. One putative environmental (viral) factor that has
been implicated in AD etiology is herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). An infectious etiology for AD would
suggest that the genes of the host immune system might also mediate the putative pathways towards the
development of this disorder. Indeed, the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses of AD
have reported many risk-conferring genes that are enriched in the immune system pathways. The GWAS of
AD, however, do not evaluate a major gene complex of the immune system—GM (g marker) allotypes encoded
by immunoglobulin heavy chain G (IGHG) genes on chromosome 14. HSV1 is a ubiquitous herpesvirus. Not all
HSV1-infected people are equally likely to develop AD-related complications, suggesting the involvement of
host genetic factors in the HSV1-spurred dementia. Immunoglobulin GM allotypes are excellent candidate
genes for modifying the HSV1-AD association, because they modulate the HSV1 immunoevasion strategies
and, epistatically with Fcg receptor (FcgR) genes, contribute to the magnitude of antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity of HSV1-infected cells. In a recent study, we have shown that a GM genotype was associated with
a 4-fold increased risk of AD. This association was independent of apolipoprotein e4 genotype and other AD
risk genes. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that GM genes are risk factors for AD, and the
underlying mechanisms include their influence on the magnitude of humoral immunity to HSV1 proteins and
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of neuronal cells. The following specific aims will test our
hypothesis: 1) Determine if GM genotypes are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. DNA from a large study
population of AD patients and controls will be characterized for several GM alleles to confirm our preliminary
findings; 2) Determine if the magnitude of antibody responsiveness to particular HSV1 proteins is associated
with GM alleles. We will quantitate antibody responses to HSV1-gD (a major glycoprotein and vaccine
candidate) in the sera of AD patients and controls and determine if the magnitude of antibody responsiveness
is associated with GM allotypes; 3) Determine if particular allelic combinations of Fc (GM) and cellular FcgR
alleles influence the level of ADCP. Using HSV-gD as target, we will determine whether the level of anti-HSV1-
gD-mediated ADCP is associated with particular combinations of Fcg (GM) and FcgRIIa alleles. Results of this
investigation may begin to address the recurrent criticism of studies documenting the HSV1-AD association:
Why the prevalence of HSV1 infection does not correlate with the prevalence of AD in the population?"

10756127,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
The rapid expansion of approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)
and the diverse individual variation in treatment response contribute to the critical unmet need
for individually tailored treatment strategy for the nearly 3 million persons with multiple sclerosis
(pwMS) worldwide. The shift towards a precision medicine approach to guide treatment
selection based on individual profiles will improve patient outcome by ensuring prompt initiation
of effective DMTs while avoiding ineffective DMTs. To fill the knowledge gaps due to the
absence of randomized clinical trial evidence and to advance precision medicine for pwMS, it is
crucial to harness available clinical data and develop approaches deployable at the point of
care. Electronic health records (EHR) data contain a wealth of longitudinal real-world clinical
information and provide a complementary platform for clinical discovery. Building on our prior
research efforts, the proposed study has the overall goal to optimize DMT selection and patient
outcomes in pwMS using EHR data. We will use EHR data from two academic healthcare
systems, both ideally positioned as they contain longitudinal clinical information of thousands of
pwMS and hold crucial linkage to MS research registries that provide the ground truth. For
additional validation, we will use integrated claims and EHR data from a large population of
commercially insured pwMS. Aim 1: Compare relapse outcomes across DMTs. We will test
the hypothesis that confounder correction using full EHR features yields more robust and
consistent results in DMT effectiveness comparison analysis than expert-selected covariates.
We will test the generalizability by using a transfer learning approach. Aim 2: Identify patient
clusters based on DMT prescription sequences over time. We will test the hypothesis that
DMT prescription sequences inform differential patient clusters and MS outcomes. We will apply
a covariate-adjusted mixture Markov Model. Aim 3: Identify optimal DMT sequences that
predict favorable treatment response. We will test the hypothesis that optimized DMT
prescription sequence(s) through reinforcement learning could improve MS outcomes (i.e.,
relapse rate, patient-reported outcomes). This research will close knowledge gaps due to
absent randomized clinical trial evidence and limited real-world evidence to guide optimal MS
treatment selection. It will bring precision medicine closer to pwMS by developing clinically
deployable strategies to optimize treatment selection. This project is consistent with the mission
of the NINDS to reduce the burden of neurological diseases such as MS."
10814911,"Abstract
Improving the survival of children with central nervous system (CNS) cancers, especially brain cancers such as
medulloblastoma (MB), the most frequent CNS cancer in children, will require overcoming two therapeutic
barriers: the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood tumor barrier (BTB). Medulloblastoma (MB), a malignant
pediatric brain tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common brain tumor and leading cause of non-accidental
death in children and adults, especially children under 5 years. Overall the Group 3 (G3) subtype of MB has the
worst overall prognosis, expresses the ABC transporter, ABCG2, and are the most difficult to treat. High
expression of ABCG2 in G3 MB is associated with poor overall survival. We have shown in a pre-clinical murine
model of G3 MB (that faithfully recapitulates the human disease) that ABCG2 in the tumor (the BTB) remains an
obstacle to effective therapy. ABCG2's high expression at the BBB also limits the therapeutic effectiveness of
many active CNS medications. Overcoming ABCG2 activity by more than competitive inhibition is a desirable
strategy and likely to provide a more durable suppression of ABCG2 activity and consequently improvement in
chemotherapeutic efficacy. Our promising preliminary data shows that we have developed a novel ABCG2
pharmacophore model and used this to identify a new ABCG2 inhibitor that promotes ABCG2 loss of function by
activating retrieval from the membrane. The membrane retrieval of ABCG2 appears to be initiated by a specific
protein interaction that is driven by the inhibitor because removal of the inhibitor results in loss of the protein
interaction. We propose three complementary Aims that encompass studies that will mechanistically elucidate
how this new inhibitor not only initiates the retrieval of ABCG2 from the membrane, but also determines its
efficacy compared to a conventional ABCG2 inhibitor. The aims will: 1) test the hypothesis that ABCG2 inhibition
can be driven by loss of membrane localization. 2) elucidate the genetic and molecular pathway by which the
inhibitor promotes ABCG2 membrane retrieval. 3) determine if the novel ABCG2 inhibitor is more effective than
conventional inhibitors in improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy in G3 MB. The knowledge from this project
will have important therapeutic implications and promote improved strategies for treating children with G3 MB."
10744791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to develop a new mechanism-based therapy to improve the antitumor efficacy
and sustainability of enzalutamide. Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is the 2nd-leading cause of cancer death
in men in the US. Castration resistant PCa (CRPC) is the most common and lethal form of the disease.
Effective and life-saving treatment is an unmet need. Recently, the enzalutamide (Enz)-based treatment has
shown promising clinical results. However, many patients do not respond or quickly develop resistance. New
mechanistic understandings and treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve Enz. In CRISPR/Cas9-
based screen, we identified glutamic pyruvate transaminases (GPT) as a novel vulnerability or target,
sensitizing CRPC cells to Enz. Clinically, we found that GPT is amplified or upregulated in subsets of patient
samples that were significantly associated with Enz-resistance and poor disease outcomes. Biologically, our
preliminary studies suggest that GPT confers adaptive response and resistance to Enz by connecting 3
important oncogenic pathways in CRPC – i) unfolded protein response (UPR), ii) glutamine metabolism, and iii)
synthesis of fatty acids and lipids (lipogenesis), which is known as the metabolic hallmark of CRPC and
essential to PCa cell survival and proliferation. Therapeutically, we screened a panel of transaminase inhibitors
and identified D-cycloserine (DCS), a clinically-approved antibiotic, as a specific and selective inhibitor to GPT,
but not other transaminases. Based on these data, we will develop a new therapy approach to improve the
antitumor efficacy and sustainability of Enz by targeting GPT with DCS. The central hypothesis is that GPT is a
novel molecular vulnerability to PCa cells, especially CRPC, in Enz-based treatments; therefore, GPT
can be therapeutically exploited by DCS to improve the efficacy and durability of Enz. We will test the
hypothesis in 3 aims. Aim 1 is to understand the mechanisms defining GPT as a novel therapeutic vulnerability
to sensitize Enz. We will reveal the biology, explaining why inhibiting GPT improves Enz. Aim 2 is to test the
role of GPT-inhibitor DCS to improve Enz in vitro and in vivo. We will test a working hypothesis that DCS
sensitizes PCa cells/tumors to Enz by arresting the growth of CRPC tumors and blocking the progression of
ADPC tumors to CRPC. Aim 3 is to determine the relevance and significance of GPT in clinical progressions of
PCa. We will use immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA-sequencing to analyze PCa tissues and biopsy
samples from patients undergoing Enz-treatments. We will test a working hypothesis that GPT mRNA/proteins
are associated with CRPC progression and Enz-resistance."
10791814,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spontaneous activity is a hallmark of developing neural systems. Prior to the maturation of vision, immature
retinal neurons spontaneously generate correlated activity. This activity propagates in the form of waves of action
potentials that sweep across the retinal ganglion cell layer. Retinal waves persist from embryonic day 16 through
two weeks after birth, a developmental period when functional circuits within the retina are emerging and retinal
projections to the brain are undergoing a tremendous amount of refinement. Here we explore three Aims regarding
mechanisms underlying the function of retinal waves.
In Aim 1, we focus on understanding the circuits that mediate embryonic retinal waves. At this age, the retina is
comprised of retinal ganglion cells, a few amacrine cells, and an extensive neuroblastic layer in which the other
cell types are differentiating. Despite the lack of mature circuit elements, retinal waves are robust. Here we test
hypotheses regarding the relative role of gap junction coupling and synaptic transmission in mediating these
waves.
In Aim 2 we focus on second postnatal week when retinal waves exhibit a profound propagation bias. During this
time period, the majority of waves travel in the nasal direction, a firing pattern which mimics optic flow induced
by forward motion. Here we explore the hypothesis that this asymmetry in propagating activity is due to
asymmetric connectivity between a GABAergic interneurons that are well integrated into wave generating
circuits.
Finally, in Aim 3 we investigate the role of retinal waves and visual stimulation of light-sensitive retinal ganglion
cells in the release of dopamine in the developing retina. Though dopamine plays a key role in several
developmental processes, what controls release is unknown. We will employ a novel imaging method that allows
for measuring phasic dopamine release in parallel with calcium transients. Using this method, we will explore the
relative role of retinal waves and light stimulation in mediating dopamine release during development.”"

Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the liver occurs during liver resection and transplantation. Steatotic livers are
highly susceptible to I/R injury than lean livers. No therapeutic strategies are currently available to attenuate I/R
injury in the patients with steatotic livers. mitoNEET (mNT) is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial outer
membrane protein containing a unique 2Fe-2S cluster that is tetrahedrally coordinated by 3 Cysteine and 1
Histidine. This small mitochondrial protein regulates redox, bioenergetics, iron homeostasis and autophagy, all
of which are indispensable in liver survival after I/R. It is unknown how hepatic mNT is affected by steatosis and
I/R. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that the accumulation of nonfunctional mNT sensitizes steatotic
livers to I/R injury. Here we have the three independent but complementary Aims. In Aim 1, we will use mouse
hepatocytes to investigate molecular mechanisms behind heightened I/R injury in steatotic livers. In Aim 2, we
will extend in vitro findings from isolated mouse hepatocytes to an in vivo model of mouse hepatic I/R. In Aim 3,
using discarded human livers, we will investigate molecular mechanisms and test the efficacy and safety of
potential therapeutic strategies."
10781940,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the 400,000 older (age ≥55) adults living with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 87% are cognitively
impaired and 25% are subsequently diagnosed with dementia. Incident dementia in older ESRD patients is
associated with a 1.5-fold higher risk of disability and 2-fold higher risk of hospitalization and mortality. Thus,
identifying modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline is critical to the field of geriatric nephrology. A highly
likely risk factor for cognitive decline and incident dementia is secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which
affects nearly all ESRD patients. SHPT, characterized by high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), is due to
mineral abnormalities in ESRD. While PTH has been associated with cognitive impairment in non-ESRD
populations we have found that median PTH levels are 54% higher in ESRD patients with cognitive impairment
(p=0.03) and 2-fold higher in those who develop dementia. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggests that
PTH increases other SHPT biomarkers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP, r=0.25, p<0.001) and FGF-23 (r=0.27,
p=0.01), which also correlates with worse executive function (r=0.64, p=0.01). We hypothesize that PTH likely
causes domain-specific cognitive decline both directly by binding to receptors in the brain and indirectly via
release of other biomarkers. Yet, we found a paucity of high-quality studies of PTH, novel bio-markers, and
cognition among ESRD patients in our systematic review; none evaluated cognitive trajectories. SHPT is
modifiable with treatment including poly-pharmacotherapy, surgical parathyroidectomy (PTDx), or waiting until
kidney transplant (KT) to reverse the etiology of SHPT. However, current SHPT treatment guidelines are
inconsistent and ignore cognitive sequelae mainly due to the paucity of high-quality studies characterizing the
impact of SHPT on cognitive function. Understanding the impact of SHPT on cognitive trajectories will allow for
tailored treatment to mitigate cognitive decline, associated morbidity, and improve shared treatment decision-
making among patients and treating surgeons, geriatricians, and nephrologists. Therefore, our central
hypothesis is that SHPT contributes to cognitive decline and incident dementia in older ESRD patients
and can be modified with treatment. This proposal will leverage and expand the scope of the oldest existing
NIA-funded longitudinal cohort study of cognition and frailty among KT patients (3,062 SHPT patients) and
prospectively enroll an additional 600 older SHPT patients in an ancillary study, in which, we will perform
assessments of novel SHPT biomarkers and longitudinal, comprehensive assessments with a new
neurocognitive battery to identify specific cognitive domains directly related to SHPT. We aim to: 1) To quantify
the association between PTH and domain-specific cognitive trajectories among older SHPT patients 2) To test
whether SHPT treatments impact cognitive outcomes, and 3) To develop a decision-making tool surrounding
personalized SHPT treatment to mitigate cognitive decline. Novel incorporation of cognitive trajectories and
SHPT biomarkers will transform practice and improve treatment decision-making in older ESRD patients."
10809019,"In the United States, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a significant public health
problem. Despite substantial efforts to improve the outcome, ~ 80% of ARDS survivors experience reduced
health-related quality of life and have fibrotic changes on chest imaging for up to 5 years after diagnosis.
Chronic alcohol abuse significantly increases the incidence of, and mortality from, ARDS, without directly
causing lung damage. Emerging data show that alcohol interferes with the circadian signaling pathway in the
liver and intestine which, in turn, render tissue susceptibility to injury and fibrosis. The circadian pathway
consists of multiple transcription factors which mediate various organ physiological functions through its
regulatory networks. It is known that some of circadian pathway molecules can regulate non-coding RNAs and
vice versa, non-coding RNAs can regulate circadian pathway molecules. In this proposal, we present
preliminary data showing that alcohol promotes circadian pathway dysfunction in the lung through alterations of
circadian pathway molecules BMAL1 and nuclear factor Retinoid-Related Orphan Receptor-alpha (RORα). We
believe these changes lead to alcohol-induced TGFβ1 by suppressing RORα-miR-139 activity. Further, we
identified the circ-RORα-miR-155 axis as a novel regulatory mechanism of BMAL1. These results led us to
hypothesize that chronic alcohol ingestion disrupts circadian pathway signaling and the circ-RORα-miR-155
axis which, thereby perturbing the RORα-miR-139 axis which, in turn, render lung susceptibility toward
fibroproliferative disrepair following acute injury. The experimental approaches are designed to test this
hypothesis. These studies will provide a firm scientific basis for the underlying mechanisms by which alcohol
interferes with tissue repair following lung injury."

UC Davis has long-standing experience providing expert administrative leadership and management of large
NIH-funded resources serving the broader research community. Since 1997, these activities have been
centralized under the UC Davis Mouse Biology Program (MBP), a campus program that provides
administrative oversight and management of resources associated with the creation, maintenance, and
phenotyping of mouse models used in biomedical research. Ten years ago, MBP administrative structure and
organization was adapted to create and implement a dedicated administrative core for the highly successful
NIDDK-funded Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) at UC Davis. As NIH sunsets the MMPC
Program to make way for a new National MPMOD Program, we will adapt approaches successfully applied to
operating the MMPC to establish an Administrative Core to serve the leadership, management, and
organizational needs of the MPMOD Center at UC Davis. The Administrative Core will be staffed by a Leader,
co-Leader, Project Navigator, a Business Manager, a Head of Information and Data Management, and a
Biostatistics and QA/QC Officer. A Local Center Steering Committee made up of senior Center leadership and
a non-affiliated senior researcher will provide scientific guidance and oversee Center administration and project
management.
To accomplish this activity, the Administrative Core will pursue the following 3 Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Assemble an Administrative Plan for the Center.

Sarm1 (sterile α and TIR motif-containing protein-1) is a NADase enzyme that is highly expressed in
the nervous system. The Sarm1 enzyme serves as a metabolic biosensor and is activated in response to
injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Based on a screen of thousands of candidates in 2013, Sarm1 was
identified as the central executioner of nerve axon degeneration. Since this time, Sarm1 has also been shown
to modulate nerve function through regulation of MAPK signaling and metabolite turnover. In response to this
pivotal discovery, Sarm1 inhibitors are now being developed for clinical management of neurodegenerative
disease. Specific to bone - nerve damage, dysfunction and clinical neuropathy have all been related to fracture
risk and impaired bone health in diverse conditions including spinal cord injury, anorexia, chemotherapy,
multiple sclerosis and diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships remain
unclear, limiting our options for therapeutic intervention. Recently, we discovered that knockout of Sarm1
prevents bone fragility in diabetic mice. Our central hypothesis is that neural Sarm1 activation restricts bone
formation, leading to decreased bone mass and strength. Conversely, we hypothesize that targeted Sarm1
inhibition can be used to simultaneously promote bone and nerve health in states of chronic Sarm1 activation,
such as diabetes. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims. First, we will isolate the role of
Sarm1-dependent neuropathy in the progression of skeletal disease. Second, we will target the function of
Sarm1 to restore bone health in vivo. When complete, this work will define the mechanisms linking nerve
damage to impaired bone health through Sarm1. We will also determine if Sarm1 inhibition is a strategy that
can be used to support bone formation in settings of skeletal disease. Our long-term goal is to promote lifelong
health and healthy aging by developing strategies to prevent or to reverse nerve and bone damage across
diverse disease states, beginning in childhood and adolescence and continuing throughout the lifespan."

Trans-ancestry genetic analysis can facilitate the discovery of trait- or disease-associated loci, characterize
shared and differential genetic architectures across populations, improve the delineation of causal variants,
and is critical for equal delivery of genomic knowledge and precision healthcare globally. However, current
trans-ancestry genetic research is impeded by (i) limited genomic resources for non-European populations;
and (ii) limited statistical methods that can appropriately model and integrate data from diverse populations.
This project will address these challenges by (i) aggregating and harmonizing genetic data, physical measures,
laboratory tests and disease information from global biobanks and multiple health care systems in the United
States, with >795K samples of non-European ancestry and a total sample size >1.5M by 2023; and (ii)
developing statistical methods and improving practices to integrate multi-ancestry data for cross-population
characterization of genetic architectures, meta-analysis, statistical fine-mapping and polygenic prediction.
Specifically, in Aim 1, we will systematically characterize the genetic underpinnings of human complex traits
and common diseases at variant, locus, regional and genome-wide levels across diverse populations, and
discover and validate novel genetic loci through trans-ancestry meta-analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop
scalable, robust, accurate and flexible statistical methods for trans-ancestry fine-mapping, delineate putative
causal genetic variants for a range of complex traits and diseases, and explore their functional consequences
and biological mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will develop haplotype-based methods for improved trans-ancestry
polygenic prediction, and benchmark the clinical utility of polygenic scores in disease risk prediction across
diverse populations. Leveraging large-scale biobank resources and novel simulation frameworks, we will
additionally enable fair and rigorous comparisons of existing and emerging methods for the integrative analysis
of multi-ancestry data, and assess various analysis choices and practical considerations in trans-ancestry fine-
mapping and genetic prediction in order to inform future study design and analysis plan, as well as methods
development, evaluation and application in trans-ancestry settings."
10796889,"Health promotion efforts among African American men have produced limited results. African American men
have lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL; i.e., a comprehensive indicator of health consisting of physical,
psychological, and social functioning) than any other ethnic-sex group in the United States. HRQoL is a measure
of population health that is associated with mortality and morbidity. HRQoL is exacerbated by stress, depression,
low levels of physical activity, and poor diet – contributors to adverse health often experienced by African
American men. There is an urgent need to develop a health promotion program to improve HRQoL among these
men. The success of such a program hinges on its ability to recruit and retain these men – African American
men constitute fewer than 10% of participants enrolled in clinical trials and are underrepresented in health
research. A health promotion program that is culturally relevant to the lived experiences of these men and
implemented through a peer-to-peer model can improve engagement, minimize attrition, and promote HRQoL.
Thus, a community-informed, peer-to-peer intervention to improve the HRQoL among African American men will
be developed. The development of this intervention will be informed by the Social Ecological Model of Health,
Social Cognitive Theory, Community-Based Participatory Research, and a community advisory board consisting
of African American men. It is hypothesized that the theoretically-based intervention will be effective in recruiting
and retaining these men, in addition to improving their HRQoL. The specific aims of the study are (1) to determine
the individual, social, and environmental characteristics that impact stress, depression, physical activity, and diet
among African American men; (2) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a community-informed, peer-to-
peer intervention to improve the HRQoL among African American men; and (3) to evaluate the efficacy of a pilot
randomized wait-list control trial to determine the preliminary impacts of the community-informed intervention on
HRQoL among African American men. This research will inform recruitment and retention efforts of African
American men in health promotion programs, in addition to strategies to improve HRQoL. The candidate’s
mentorship team consists of renowned experts in the development of tailored health promotion interventions,
the health of men of color, qualitative and quantitative research, Community-Based Participatory Research, and
technology-enhanced interventions for African American men. The training plan involves coursework, seminars,
and mentored research experiences to develop expertise in (1) qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods
research, (2) implementation and dissemination science, (3) behavioral randomized controlled trials, (4) grant-
writing, (5) health promotion and disparities among minority communities, and (6) mHealth. The research and
training proposed in this K23 Career Development Award will support the candidate’s long-term goal of becoming
an independent scientist and leading investigator in developing and testing innovative interventions to improve
the HRQoL among underserved and at-risk communities."

Despite remarkable advances in single-cell profiling, machine learning and systems biology, our ability to exploit
these measurements is limited by the lack of an appropriate framework to model and analyze them. In this
application, I propose an organic synthesis of experimental technological development, mathematical modeling,
and machine learning algorithm innovations to move beyond conventional descriptive and merely statistical
analyses of single cells to mechanistic and predictive modeling of cell fate transition over time and space, and
across transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic levels. Firstly, in order to unveil the regulatory networks that
govern the maintenance of stem cells and progenitors, I will extend the dynamo framework that published
recently to predict key regulators that stabilize or destabilize cells states, e.g. the hematopoietic stem cell state,
via sensitivity analyses of the reconstructed vector field. In addition, I will build upon the current success of
predicting a broad range of hematopoietic cell fate transitions with our least action path approach to extend it to
study other biological systems, such as pancreatic endocrinogenesis. To validate these predictions, I will
continue my ongoing collaboration with Dr. Vijay Sankran’s lab (co-mentor lab) to first implemented metabolic
labeling based scRNA-seq with the 10x chromium system and integrate it with perturb-seq that championed by
the Weissman lab (my mentor lab) to test the predicted factors’ efficacy in maintaining the HSC state. Second, I
will develop new approaches to seamlessly integrate multi-omics and harmonize short-term RNA velocities with
long-term lineage tracing. By doing so, we can enable even more accurate modeling of single cell fate transitions
that consider lineage-resolved, epigenetic, proteomic kinetics, offered by cutting-edge single-cell genomic
technologies and cutting-edge deep learning methods. Lastly, I will take advantage of my early access of mouse
embryogenesis dataset profiled with the powerful Stereo-seq through my close collaboration with BGI research
to build 3D in silico spatiotemporally models of mammalian organogenesis. I will also train myself to study other
state-of-the-art in-situ sequencing approaches, for example the STAR-map method from my collaborator, Dr.
Xiao Wang from Broad. Through the K99 phase of this proposed career development plan, I will develop new
computational toolkits and further strengthen my experiment skills, both in human hematopoiesis, Perturb-seq
and spatial transcriptomics. When combining these new skills with my rigorous training in systems biology, and
single cell genomics, I will be better prepared to transition into an independent investigator in a top-tier research
university. Undoubtedly, my research and career development during both K99 phase and my transition to R00
phase will be greatly facilitated thanks to the excellent research environment in Whitehead institute, Broad and
Harvard stem cell institute. To sum up, my proposed study will pave the road to launch my future interdisciplinary
team that aims at building mechanistic and predictive models of cell fate transitions with a focus in human
hematopoiesis."
11058745,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Organ shape is vital for proper function. Malformations in the looping and folding of the heart, for
instance, represent the leading cause of birth defect mortality in humans. Visceral organs rely on the
coordinated activity of multiple laminar tissue layers to fold and coil into targeted shapes. While the community
has learned much about the genetic signals governing cell fates during development, less is understood about
the mechanical stresses and tissue dynamics that translate gene expression into the shapes of organs. This
proposal aims to link hox gene expression to physical forces driving 3D multilayer organ shape change using
the D. melanogaster midgut as a model system.
 The midgut begins as a tube of two concentric tissue layers that undergoes a sequence of constrictions
to fold into chambers. Hox genes — conserved master regulators of patterning during development — have
long been known to govern the ﬁnal shape of this organ, but the mechanical stresses and tissue dynamics
translating hox expression into organ shape have remained elusive. We recently found that organ constrictions
proceed through a mechanical program mediated by calcium pulses in the outer layer, under the control of hox
genes. Advances in light-sheet microscopy now enable live visualization of the whole organ at sub-cellular
resolution during development. Integrating these imaging methods with physics approaches provides the ability
to follow cell dynamics across tissue layers throughout morphogenesis and quantitatively relate genetic
patterning in the tissue to the tissue mechanics and dynamic cellular behaviors driving 3D shape change.
 The proposed work aims to ﬁrst (1) decode the relationship between the hox gene expression pattern to
the downstream pattern of calcium pulses in the midgut. (2) Secondly, a physical model will relate calcium
pulses to tissue-scale mechanical stress, using spatiotemporal maps of calcium activity to constrain an in silico
model of the morphing tissue. Together, these aims will reveal how genetic patterning controls a mechanical
process to sculpt complex shapes in a bilayer organ. (3) Finally, this proposal will address how the midgut
model visceral organ coils into a chiral tube later during development. Recent discoveries of `cell intrinsic'
chirality, in which cytoskeletal machinery breaks left-right symmetry, have proven to provide a major role in
determining organ-scale chirality. The mechanical process by which cell chirality translates into 3D organ-scale
shape change, however, remains largely unknown. By combining the in toto imaging toolkit and molecular
biology approaches mastered during the K99 phase with my expertise in chiral mechanics from my PhD, this
aim will link cellular chirality to the dynamics of organ-scale coiling.
 Together, these research aims and the training in biology, microscopy, and modeling during the K99
phase will ensure I am equipped to begin an independent research lab revealing the physical mechanisms
harnessed by biology to sculpt complex shapes of visceral organs."
10841703,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cocaine (COC) use disorder (CUD) remains a significant medical, social, and legal public-health concern.
Because behavioral therapies alone have limited efficacy, identification of pharmacotherapy that improves CUD
treatment outcomes is sorely needed. Emerging preclinical evidence supports the potential clinical utility of
stimulating the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) for treating CUD. Preclinical studies show
that administration of a GLP-1R agonist attenuates COC self-administration, as well as COC-induced locomotor
stimulation4, conditioned place preference, and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Significantly,
administering a GLP-1R agonist during abstinence following COC self-administration attenuated the
reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior at doses that did not affect food intake or produce other adverse effects.
Despite promising preclinical findings, and that COC administration significantly reduces serum concentrations
of GLP-1 in humans, there has been only one human laboratory study in which administration of the GLP-1R
agonist, exenatide, did not alter either the self-administration or subjective effects of COC in people with CUD.
Multiple study limitations, including the use of an acute dose of exenatide rather than chronic pre-treatment,
evaluation of only a single dose of COC, as well as the lack of both a placebo COC dose and an alternative to COC
(i.e., a choice) in the free-access self-administration paradigm preclude drawing firm conclusions about the
efficacy of exenatide for CUD. The overall objective of this application is to determine if GLP-1R agonism is a
viable treatment strategy for CUD. This goal will be achieved through the conduct of a rigorous human clinical
pharmacology study in which non-treatment seeking COC users (n=44) will be randomized (1:1) to a
maintenance dose (0 mg (i.e., placebo) or 2 mg subcutaneously once a week) of extended-release (XR) exenatide
for six weeks. The 6-week maintenance period, sufficient to achieve steady-state, will result in more stable
concentrations of clinically effective doses before assessing treatment effects. Before and after the 6-week
maintenance period, we will determine COC (0, 20, 40 mg: IV) self-administration rates. To accurately predict
clinical efficacy, we will use forced-choice procedures in which participants choose to either self-administer COC
or receive money. Our central hypothesis is that XR-exenatide will reduce COC self-administration compared to
placebo. We expect that by (1) using a rigorous human laboratory experimental design, (2) testing treatment
effects after achieving steady-state levels, and (3) employing appropriate endpoints for demonstrating treatment
effectiveness in a laboratory setting, this project will provide definitive data regarding the potential of exenatide
for reducing COC self-administration. The GLP-1R represents a substantial departure from previous treatment
targets for CUD, and the drug-drug interaction safety data will provide the impetus for conducting a Phase II
clinical trial. By repurposing an FDA-approved medication that does not have abuse potential, exenatide can
advance through the development pipeline, thereby impacting clinical research and practice more quickly."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly caused by complex interactions
of genetic and environmental risk factors. An estimated 130 million people will develop AD by 2050, constituting
an urgent clinical need for effective treatments and therapies to be developed. Prior therapies have focused on
resolving pathological hallmarks, such as senile plaques (Ab) and neurofibrillary tangles (tau), but have failed to
improve cognitive function in patients. The RNA kinase, CLP1, was recently found to be a genetic mediator AD.
Additionally, high mRNA levels of CLP1 correlated with poor cognitive function in patients. Our preliminary
histological analysis of brain samples from dementia patients and a mouse model of AD, with controls, found a
shared, aberrant expression pattern of CLP1 protein with disease. Together, these findings lead us to
hypothesize that CLP1 overexpression may contribute to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline in AD.
To test this idea, we will intercross mouse models of AD with Clp1 heterozygous mutant mice and assess disease
pathology and cognitive decline during AD progression for amelioration."

 The broad objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanism of homologous
recombination in humans, and to understand how the consequences of defects in recombinational DNA repair
result in chromosomal instability and predisposition to cancers. Understanding the functions of key proteins in
homologous recombination, many of which are tumor suppressors, will provide insight into how mutations in
these proteins can predispose individuals to cancer. We plan to elucidate the biochemical roles and examine
the mechanism of BRCA1, BLM, EXO1, PALB2, WRN, and the RAD51 paralogs (RAD51B, RAD51C,
RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3) functions, as well as the consequences of the interactions between these
proteins, to provide insight into their role in recombinational DNA repair. We plan to reconstitute the initial steps
of human recombinational DNA repair, focusing on the DNA resection step, and thereby understand the
biochemical functions of these proteins. In addition, we will use single-molecule technologies to reveal the
molecular mechanisms by which these proteins act."

Thrombosis, the obstruction of blood flow due to the formation of clot in blood vessels, accounts for 1 in 4
deaths worldwide. In particular, venous thrombi occur in deep veins most often in the legs or arms and is
commonly known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT and pulmonary embolism are collectively referred to as
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in which a part of the venous thrombus breaks off, travel to the lungs, and
lodge in pulmonary arteries. VTE is the 3rd leading cause of cardiovascular-related deaths globally with
estimates of >500,000 deaths in the United States every year. VTE is reported to be the leading cause of
disability-adjusted life years lost in hospitalized patients.
Despite the large amount of capital invested in drug development, very few drugs are ultimately proven useful
in humans. Such a low yield occurs largely because planar cell culture and animal models for testing the drugs
oftentimes fail to reflect human physiology/pathology. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) human cell-based in
vitro models have been increasingly adopted to improve drug testing by recapitulating physiological and
pathological parameters of their human counterparts. In addition to the development of engineered human-
based microtissues, real-time, in situ, non-invasive volumetric monitoring of the behaviors of the engineered
vascular models and their responses towards viral infection/drug treatment is a key capacity to achieve
high(er)-throughput and accurate in vitro screening of promising drug candidates.
Here we propose to harness our unique expertise in engineered in vitro human vascular tissue models and
high-speed label-free imaging of thrombosis with further aid by strong experiences in clinical hematology and
anticoagulation management in patients. Together, we will create an enabling and first-of-its-kind high(er)-
throughput real-time imaging-integrated thrombosis-on-chip model to study thrombosis and potential
therapeutic agents, taking severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as a
timely example to instruct future preparedness for pandemics and other vascular disorders."
10756151,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 has revolutionized cancer
therapy, but only a subset of patients respond, highlighting the critical need to investigate
mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity to identify novel targets to enhance the effects of ICB. The
goal of this project is to determine mechanisms by which one-carbon (1C) metabolism can be
modulated to improve the efficacy of PD-1 blockade. We recently identified 1C metabolism, which
allows cells to utilize serine or glycine to generate 1C units for nucleotides, NADPH, and
glutathione biosynthesis, as the most induced metabolic pathway during T cell activation. We also
discovered that there are deficits in serine and glucose levels in the tumor microenvironment
(TME). Strikingly, restoring 1C metabolism by formate supplementation increases the
effectiveness of anti-PD-1 treatment and tumor clearance in mouse tumor models. We
hypothesize that 1C metabolism is limiting for anti-tumor T cell function and that increasing this
pathway by formate supplementation can synergize with ICB to promote anti-tumor immunity. We
will test this hypothesis in two aims: Aim 1: Determine cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which formate supplementation improves the efficacy of PD-1 mediated tumor clearance.
We will define transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by which 1C metabolism and formate
supplementation improve CD8+ T cell function and synergize with PD-1 blockade. We will use
innovative conditional knockout models and in vivo genetic perturbation studies to delete rate-
limiting enzymes of 1C metabolism in CD8+ T cells, and analyze their impact on response to PD-
1 blockade. Aim 2: Determine metabolic mechanisms by which formate supplementation
improves the efficacy of PD-1 mediated tumor clearance. We will use cellular and in vivo mass
spectrometry-based metabolite tracing studies, and spatial metabolomics to elucidate how
formate supplementation and modulation of 1C metabolism impact metabolic profiles of anti-
tumor CD8+ T cells when combined with anti-PD-1. These studies will provide us with the first
spatial and single cell resolution atlas of metabolic and functional immune responses in a tumor
in response to ICB. We will determine how formate supplementation improves CD8+ T cell
responses from the level of individual CD8+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the metabolically
heterogenous TME. Completion of these studies will be transformative by changing the paradigm
of 1C metabolism in cancer treatment and demonstrating that supplementing 1C units can
enhance anti-tumor immunity. Our results will inform strategies and identify novel therapeutic
targets for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes."

Improving early identification. We focus on several promising assessments of lexico-semantic abilities in

these children longitudinally to assess whether and how growth in three main lexico-semantic skills (structure,
learning, and processing) predicts language outcomes at age 4, when clinical language disorder status can
initially be assessed. To fully characterize how early skills and trajectories lead to later outcomes, we carry out
several analyses on concurrent and predictive relations between skills and create detailed models of children's

My research will focus on investigation of fundamental characteristics of antiretroviral penetration into the central nervous
system (CNS) using in vitro and animal models, with confirmation of penetration properties in people with HIV, followed
by development and translation of a new approach to assess the anti-HIV activity of an entire antiretroviral regimen (as
opposed to just that of an individual drug). The long-term goal is to develop novel strategies to achieve complete viral cure
in all reservoirs of people with HIV. This proposal is clinically significant because HIV is known to persist in the brain,
even in patients receiving potent antiretroviral regimens, who are highly adherent and have undetectable plasma HIV viral
load. Given advancements in HIV therapeutics, people with HIV are older due to longer life expectancies(1, 2). However,
even with advancements in HIV therapeutics, the rates of HIV-associated brain disturbances continue to remain high(3).
Emerging evidence suggests that older patients with HIV may be at an even higher risk of developing HIV-associated
neurocognitive dysfunction due to age and viral burden in the CSF(4, 5). Thus, there is an unmet need for improved
personalized medicine approaches directed towards maximizing antiviral exposures to decrease viral burden throughout the
whole body. Importantly, the goals of my research address the neurologic complications focus component of the
current NIH Priorities for HIV and HIV-Related Research which is to “Address HIV-Associated Comorbidities,
Coinfections and Complications”.
On completion of the award period, I will have acquired the expertise to conduct independent research in CNS focused HIV

become an independent clinical scientist and leader in the field of HIV viral reservoir related pharmacology."
10766768,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tendon injuries often occur near their bony attachments, requiring surgical repair of tendon to bone. Outcomes
after repair, however, are poor and result in pain, reinjury, and repeated surgeries. Rotator cuff repair, for
example, is among the most common shoulder surgeries, yet is plagued by 20-94% failure rates. At the root of
these poor outcomes is a lack of regeneration of the enthesis, the specialized tissue that connects healthy
tendon and bone. In contrast to the disorganized scar that forms during tendon-to-bone healing, the healthy
enthesis has spatial gradients in cell phenotypes, extracellular matrix composition, mineral content, and
mechanical properties. This functional grading allows for effective transfer of stress between two materials,
tendon and bone, with vastly different mechanical properties. The enthesis is formed by a pool of cells during
fetal and early postnatal development that is unique from tendon and cartilage precursors. We previously
defined the lineage of these Gli1+ enthesis stem cells (ESCs) and showed that initiation and mineralization of
the enthesis requires hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Despite this work, the transcriptional network that controls ESC
differentiation remains elusive. A better understanding of the developmental cues necessary for enthesis
formation, and mineralization in particular, will help guide new stem cell treatment approaches for adult tendon-
to-bone repair. Aim 1 will determine the transcriptional regulation of enthesis stem cell differentiation. Gli1-
CreERT-mTmG mice will be used to isolate enthesis cells from different developmental stages and scRNAseq
will be used to define their transcriptomes. The transcription factors Klf2/4 and Runx1 will be examined as
putative regulators of ESC differentiation and mineralization. Aim 2 will determine the necessity and sufficiency
of Gli1+ enthesis stem cells for enthesis regeneration. Healing will be evaluated using our mouse rotator cuff
tendon enthesis injury model. The necessity of Gli1+ enthesis stem cells and Hh signaling for regeneration will
be tested using cell ablation and loss-of-function models, respectively. The sufficiency of Gli+ enthesis stem
cells and Hh signaling for regeneration will be tested by delivery of these cells to enthesis injuries and using
gain-of-function models, respectively. These studies will identify the molecular mechanisms by which
progenitor cells form and mineralize the enthesis. Results will have a direct impact on future regenerative
strategies for tendon-to-bone repair."
11002805,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), accounting for ~47% and
~39% of US incident and prevalent end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, respectively. Our published
research has shown that hypoglycemia is a highly prevalent complication associated with higher death risk in
diabetic kidney disease (DKD) patients. Diabetic hemodialysis (HD) patients are at heightened risk for
hypoglycemia via multiple pathways, including 1) decreased renal gluconeogenesis, 2) impaired metabolism/
clearance of DM medications, 3) co-existing comorbidities, 4) limited in-center HD food access, and 5) intra-
dialytic glucose shifts. Given the ill effects of hypoglycemia on the cardiovascular (CV) health (arrhythmia,
myocardial ischemia) and psychological well-being (hypoglycemia fear, stress/anxiety) observed in non-CKD
studies, and the poor survival of diabetic HD patients (<35% over 5 years) largely due to CV causes, there is
an urgent unmet need to identify strategies that mitigate low glycemic complications in this population.
 One of the major barriers to optimal glycemic control in DKD has been the lack of access to a practical,
reliable method for frequent glycemic assessment. In diabetic HD patients, conventional metrics (self-
monitored blood glucose [SMBG], HbA1c) are dominantly used despite limitations in accuracy, convenience,
and intermittent frequency. In contrast, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a convenient, automated
glycemic assessment method that has shown improved glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemia in non-
CKD trials. While our pilot data of CGM in HD patients shows strong agreement with gold-standard blood
glucose levels and superior identification of hypoglycemia, it remains uncertain as to whether CGM can
improve glycemic control, reduce hypoglycemia, optimize patient-reported outcomes in this population.
 To address this knowledge gap, we propose this Multiple-PI R01 study in which we aim to conduct a
parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing real-time CGM using Dexcom G6 devices vs.
usual care (SMBG 4-times/day) among 122 in-center HD patients with DM over a 12-week period. Our primary
objective will be to determine the effects of CGM vs. usual care on glycemic control, defined by percent (%) of
time in target glucose range (70-180 mg/dl). Our main and exploratory secondary objectives will be to
determine the effects of CGM on CGM-indices of hypoglycemia, blood-based glycemic markers (HbA1c,
glycated albumin, fructosamine), and patient-reported outcomes (health-related quality of life, diabetes
distress, hypoglycemia fear). We will also evaluate feasibility endpoints by measuring CGM compliance during
the intervention period and success/ease of implementing CGM training sessions among patients. This single-
center pilot RCT is the critical first step in determining the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of CGM in diabetic HD
patients, and it will provide the requisite preliminary data to inform the framework of future large-scale, multi-
center corollary RCT’s with an expanded number of endpoints, participants, and sites."
10841388,"The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are
among the most debilitating inflammatory disorders of the western world. It is estimated that more
than 3 million Americans suffer with IBD, with incidence rates on the rise in many populations. A
recent study of more than 100,000 military service members estimated the incidence of IBD to be
2-10 times greater than non-service members, with a striking relationship between IBD incidence
and the number of life stressors. The precise etiology of IBD is currently unknown.
 Our interest is focused on the identification of inflammation-associated changes in tissue
metabolsim during flares of active inflammation. Our ongoing studies are founded on the
observation that active intestinal inflammation is characterized by significant shifts in tissue
metabolism that can influence cell and tissue function in fundamentally important ways. Under
such conditions, epithelial cells have the capacity to dynamically control mucosal resolution and
do so with a high degree of fidelity. The precise mechanisms by which metabolic pathways control
resolution, however, have yet to be elucidated. Our work in progress has conclusively revealed
that energy utilization becomes compromised during active inflammation and that creatine and its
associated creatine kinase (CK) family of enzymes are fundamental in shuttling of high energy
phosphates in the form of phosphocreatine between sites of ATP generation. Moreover, we have
shown that double-mutant mice lacking the brain and mitochondrial isoforms of CK (termed the
CK dKO) are significantly more susceptible to acute colitis as measured by multiple disease
parameters. In addition to impaired barrier function, CK dKO mice showed defective inflammatory
responses underscored by nearly non-existent levels of colonic IFN.
 In this proposal, we will define how creatine metabolism molds the mucosal tissue
environment during inflammation. Three synergistic specific aims are directed at testing the
hypothesis that CK expression and activity within the epithelia and immune cells are fundamental
in inflammatory resolution responses in the mucosa. Aim 1 will elucidate how creatine kinase(s)
ultimately influence tissue metabolism during active inflammation. Aim 2 will define the regulation
of IFN by CK enzymes. Specific Aim 3 will illuminate the relationship between IFN and CK
metabolism in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. It is our hope that these results will reveal
new insights into innate regulation of mucosal inflammatory resolution and that extensions of this
work will lead to targets for experimental therapeutics."

identify family-specific needs, intervene briefly, and match families with tailored community resources. Two
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown assignment to FC improves maternal mental health and
reduces population rates of child abuse investigations but does not have long-term impact on child behavior.
To improve and equalize population outcomes in parenting and child well-being, CN has been developed
through piloting as a universal psychosocial system of primary care across early life. Trained navigators reach
women during pregnancy, continue with FC at birth, and complete well-family visits at 12, 24, and 36 months
of child age to provide support, assess family-specific needs, deliver brief interventions, and connect families
with community resources for ongoing needs. With philanthropic support, CN is now being delivered through
an RCT with a community sample of 800 families in Durham, NC. 400 families have been assigned to receive
CN across the period from pregnancy through kindergarten, and 400 families have been assigned as care-as-
usual controls. Data analyses will test four hypotheses: (1) intervention efficacy: compared to controls, CN-
assigned families will demonstrate lower rates of child maltreatment, less child emergency medical care
utilization, better parent mental health, more positive parenting behaviors, and better child cognitive and
behavioral development through age 5; (2) disparity reduction: random assignment to CN will be
associated with reduction of race and income disparities, operationalized as positive impact of CN assignment
on each group with even stronger impact on low-income families and families of color; (3) intervention
mediation: improved parent mental health, parent self-advocacy, and parenting behaviors will account for
population impact (mediation) and disparity reduction (mediated moderation) in children’s behavioral
outcomes; and (4) how disparities develop: race and income disparities in access to community resources
in early life will account for race and income disparities in child outcomes at kindergarten. This proposal offers
an urgent, cost-shared opportunity to evaluate the population impact, disparity reduction, and mechanisms of
a novel system of primary care for birthing families. The project will contribute to public health by providing
empirical knowledge about an affordable, innovative, universal system of primary psychosocial care that aims
to improve population outcomes and reduce population disparities in parent mental health, positive parenting
behaviors, rates of child maltreatment, and child cognitive and behavioral development, and testing the
mechanisms through which disparities develop and this intervention operates to reduce them."
10901835,"Despite medical advances, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a leading cause of death. ACVD is
caused by chronic inflammatory due to both excessive inflammation and failed inflammation resolution. Unlike
inhibition of inflammation that reduces ACVD but increases fatal infections, restoration of inflammation resolution
may reduce ACVD without increased fatal infections. Macrophages resolve inflammation by secreting anti-in-
flammatory mediators and phagocytosing dead cells in a process termed efferocytosis. Efferocytosis increases
intracellular free fatty acids (FA) that must be processed either through β-oxidation, incorporation in glycerolipids
or ceramides. The movement of FA into these different pathways is called lipid channeling. Increased β-oxidation
is associated with macrophage resolution and is considered atheroprotective, while ceramide metabolism pro-
motes inflammation and is considered atherogenic. However, there are several critical questions: 1) Is one path-
way more critical to inflammation resolution than the other, 2) does the alteration of one lipid pathway alter the
other, 3) how lipid channeling is regulated during resolution and plaque regression. Lipin-1 is a phosphatidic acid
phosphatase with transcriptional coregulatory activity. My laboratory showed that macrophage-associated lipin-
1 is needed for inflammation resolution and atherosclerotic regression and likely does this through regulation of
FA metabolism, independent of its enzymatic activity. Our central hypothesis is that lipin-1 is a dominant lipid
channeling regulator in macrophages, promoting inflammation resolution and atherosclerosis regression by en-
hancing β-oxidation and repressing ceramide synthesis. We will test our central hypothesis and accomplish the
objective of this application by pursuing three specific aims. Aim 1 will explore the hypothesis that lipin-1 regu-
lates the activity of metabolic transcription factors to fine-tune FA metabolic pathways to align with macrophage
resolution activity. Aim 2 will examine which FA pathways (FA metabolism, β-oxidation, or ceramide metabolism)
are critical to macrophage inflammation resolution response and find if the alteration in one pathway impacts the
others. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that lipin-1 non-enzymatic activity promotes atherosclerotic regression
and map the FA metabolic state of the regressing plaque. These proposed experiments will support the innova-
tive idea that lipin-1 in macrophages is a dominant regulator of lipid channeling and promotes inflammation
resolution by enhancing beta-oxidation while repressing ceramide synthesis. This application's beneficial impact
will be the understanding that fatty acid metabolism is regulated to limit lipotoxicity and promote inflammation
resolution to identify therapeutic targets to reduce the burden of atherosclerosis and its pathologic sequelae."
10754933,"ABSTRACT: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare, devastating, and understudied malignancy with ~20,00 new cases
and around 61,000 cases in US. Though intensive chemotherapy primarily consisting of ara C (also known as cytarabine),
daunorubicin, and etopside have been used to treat AML for over 4 decades, only 65%, 40%, and 10% of pediatric (age
<21), adult (age 21-65), and elderly (age > 65) patients survive 5 years after diagnosis, respectively. Application co-PIs,
Drs. Lamba (pharmacology) and Pounds (biostatistician specializing in cancer genomics) have successfully collaborated
for over a decade to develop methods and discover molecular prognostic factors for AML. We and other investigators from
Children’s Oncology group have recently characterized the genome, methylome, and transcriptome of pediatric AML and
associated each of these with prognosis in pediatric AML. Dr. Pounds developed the innovative integrative analysis
procedure, canonical correlation with projection onto the most interesting statistical evidence (CC-PROMISE), that
dramatically increases statistical power for meaningful biological discovery in a rare-disease small sample size setting;
using CC-PROMISE, we discovered that reduced methylation and increased expression of the DNMT3B associates with
greater genome-wide methylation burden and worse prognosis; translating the DNMT3B discovery into evaluation of
demethylating agents in the ongoing AML16 clinical trial (NCT03164057). These genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic
features, along with microenvironmental and other factors, must impact the proteome and metabolome of AML in clinically
relevant ways which unfortunately are not well understood. There has been essentially no study focused on comprehensive
evaluation of the proteome and metabolome of pediatric AML in a reasonable cohort of uniformly treated patients. Noting
the marked genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, and prognostic differences between pediatric and adult AML, it is not
plausible to extrapolate finding from adult AML patients to pediatric. Thus an integrated systems-level understanding of
the molecular disease biology is needed to develop effective strategies and improve the prognosis of pediatric AML. As
pioneers in the collection and integrated analysis of the pediatric AML genome, methylome, and transcriptome,
application co-PIs Drs. Lamba and Pounds are uniquely positioned to characterize the proteome and metabolome
of pediatric AML and integrate them with our large repository of previously collected molecular, treatment, and
outcome data for a series of multi-center clinical trials. Thus, in this application we propose to characterize global
metabolome (aim 1) and proteome (aim 2) the leukemic cell obtained at diagnosis for risk stratification and prognosis by
evaluating impact on outcome in three St Jude led multi-institute clinical trials (AML02, AML08 and AML16, total patients
n=400). In aim 3, we plan to develop a comprehensive integrated view of the genome, methylome, transcriptome,
proteome, metabolome, and clinical prognosis of pediatric AML using novel methods. These innovative and
exceptionally rigorous studies will be the first comprehensive evaluation of the pediatric AML metabolome and proteome
and develop an innovative integrated analysis method to perform the first integrated analysis of five forms of omic data with
multiple clinical endpoints to obtain the most complete understanding of pediatric AML systems biology to date."
10811748,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term objective of our research is to learn and understand genetic mechanisms underlying initiation
and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and to develop effective screening, diagnosis, preventive,
and treatment strategies in the fight against T1DM. In this project, our focus is on genetic associations with the
progression from seroconversion to the onset of T1DM, more specifically, discovering novel Conformational
Regulatory Segments (CRS) in HLA/KIR/FcGR/IGHG genes that are responsible for the disease progression;
CRS refer to both regulatory and functional elements, including peptides, nucleotides or other regulatory
elements within or between genes. The HLA/KIR/FcGR/IGHG genes are highly polymorphic and Next
Generation Targeted Sequencing (NGTS) will be used as extended genetic polymorphisms go under the radar
of GWAS. Discovering and characterizing progression-associated CRS within HLA/KIR/FcGR/IGHG genes
would help us to understand the genetic mechanism of the disease progression, and further to develop
effective prevention and treatment remedies to slow or even revert progression to clinical diagnosis. In 2018,
we received a bridge funding from NIDDK to carry out a pilot study of HLA genes in the disease progression,
based on Diabetes Prevention Trial-1 (DPT-1). Our pilot study produced an important finding of two specific
residues β57 and (-18β), within HLA-DQB1, in which β57 was structurally known to play an important role in
antigen recognition and the residue (-18β) located in the signal peptide. In support of this application, we
obtained clinical and genetic data from another multi-center international Oral Insulin Prevention Trial (TN07)
and were able to replicate the genetic association with β57. We were able to partially replicate the association
with the residue (-18β), even though DQ genotyping at intermediate resolution did not cover the residue (-18β)
located in the signal peptide. To build on this preliminary result, this proposal has two specific aims: Aim 1 is to
estimate the penetrance of DQB1* β57, with or without (-18β), to the progression from the precisely
determined seroconversion to T1DM onset, using The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY). TEDDY is a prospectively conducted birth cohort and has frequent measurements of autoantibodies
so that seroconversion time can be precisely determined. Aim 2 is to carry out mechanistic investigation of
DQB1 CRS as well as additional CRS in HLA/KIR/ FcGR/IGHG genes, leveraging extensive functional data
collected in TEDDY. Specifically, we will assess how discovered CRS associate with longitudinally measured
autoantibody levels (GADA, IAA, IA-2A, ZnT8A), the β-cell function (glucose, C-peptide, OGTT) and HbA1c
levels, and will investigate how CRS associate with cis- and trans-gene expressions using the longitudinal
RNAseq data in a TEDDY case-control study. Results from this project will gain significant insights into genetic
mechanism underlying the disease progression and will impact the translational research of preventative and
therapeutic methods/strategies against T1DM."
10747425,"Abstract
The ability to promote regeneration of the central nervous system remains elusive. Stroke is a leading cause of
death and disability and creates immense burdens on stroke survivors, their caregivers, and society. Although
acute stroke care has rapidly progressed over the past decades, only a small proportion of the patients qualify
for these treatments. This leaves a majority of stroke patients without effective medical therapy to augment their
stroke recovery. Biomaterials offer a unique avenue to interact with the nervous system. Stem cell treatments
are another emerging stroke therapy that shows promise in both basic and clinical trials. However, the optimal
method and environment for stem cell delivery remains unknown. We have developed a new stem cell delivery
system (ElectricStem) that utilizes conductive polymer scaffolds to transplant neural stem cells into the stroked-
brain. Because the polymers are conductive, electrical stimulation can be combined with the transplanted neural
stem cells. We have demonstrated that electrical modulation of transplanted neural stem cells dramatically
improves stroke recovery over traditional stem cell transplantation alone. In our preliminary studies, electrical
modulation of neural stem cell transplants also increases the production of endogenous stem cells in the brain
– suggesting a possible mechanism for this improved recovery. Further investigation about the role these
endogenous stem cells play in stroke recovery will identify important stroke recovery mechanisms. By evaluating
what proteins are upregulated in the transplanted neural stem cells that receive electrical modulation, we have
identified stanniocalcin-2 (STC2) as an important pathway for improved recovery. STC2 is a glycoprotein with
paracrine effects that plays a role in cell turnover and survival. If STC2 production is increased in transplanted
neural stem cells, the animals have improved functional outcomes, and we see greater numbers of endogenous
stem cells produced. If STC2 levels are decreased in the stem cells, the improvement in function and
endogenous stem cell production is lost. Our proposed research investigates the ability of ElectricStem to recruit
endogenous stem cells and alter their activity within the injured rodent brain tissue following stroke. The effects
of electrical modulation on the transplanted neural stem cells and host brain will be evaluated in relation to the
STC2 pathway. The project will also evaluate if STC2 is a potential therapy for stroke recovery. Finally, our
ElectricStem system will be used in a translational aged rodent model to determine if the promising functional
improvements seen in young adult animals are observed in older animals. Using these new techniques, we aim
to test the hypothesis that augmentation of important endogenous recovery pathways via bioengineered systems
will improve neural repair following stroke."

Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels represent polymodal cellular sensors, which integrate chemical,
temperature, mechanical stress and membrane voltage stimuli and convert them into ionic currents to regulate
our senses of vision, hearing, taste, smell and touch and contribute to the perception of temperature and pain.
TRP channels are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases, including cancers, and
represent one of the most ardently pursued drug targets. Despite recent successes in TRP channel structure
determination, understanding of their genetic diversity, function and regulation is still far from being complete.
Such limited knowledge represents a critical barrier to devising therapeutic strategies based on TRP channel
regulation and to the progress in the rational drug design. We plan to study TRP channel structure and function
using a combination of different biophysical and biochemical methods. Our specific aims are: 1) establish
molecular bases of TRPV6 polymorphisms and disease variants, 2) determine structural mechanisms of TRPV6
inhibition, and 3) identify structural elements underlying similarities and difference in gating and regulation of
TRPV6 and other TRP channels. TRP channels are challenging targets for structure-functional studies because
they represent multimeric integral membrane proteins of a large size with typically low expression levels. To
achieve our goals, we will use a combination of structural and functional approaches, including modern cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, protein engineering, Fluorescence-based Size Exclusion
Chromatography (FSEC), calcium imaging, fluorescent spectroscopy and electrophysiology. We will express
TRP channels, their mutants and genetic variants in eukaryotic cell lines, purify them using different membrane
mimetic systems, and determine cryo-EM and crystal structures in the presence of different stimuli. We will then
combine the nascent structural information with functional data to discern molecular mechanisms of TRP channel
gating, inhibition and regulation by Ca2+, temperature and lipids. Achieving our aims will significantly improve
understanding of TRP channel structure and function, resulting in a new dynamic template for theoretical
prediction, in silico fitting and chemical synthesis of new drugs."
10754955,"Project Summary
Antipsychotic therapy is widely used in the treatment of psychiatric conditions including bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. These conditions, which together affect more than 20% of the
population, usually require lifelong medication. Atypical antipsychotics have superior therapeutic action and
reduced adverse effects as compared with typical antipsychotics, but the use of atypical antipsychotics is also
associated with dyslipidemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients. The underlying
mechanisms responsible for these adverse effects remain largely unknown, which poses serious health
challenges to patients undergoing long-term antipsychotic treatment. To this end, we recently identified several
atypical antipsychotics including quetiapine that promote dyslipidemia, as potent agonists for the nuclear
receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR). Our previous work revealed novel and unsuspected roles of PXR in lipid
homeostasis and atherogenesis, and showed that PXR ligands increase dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in
atherogenic mouse models including PXR-humanized mice. Given intestine and lymphatic systems are
essential for dietary lipid absorption and transport, our latest preliminary study using novel tissue-specific PXR
knockout mouse models demonstrated that exposure to quetiapine fails to cause hyperlipidemia in intestine-
specific PXR knockout mice. How PXR signaling in enterocytes regulates the intestinal lipid metabolism is an
open and highly clinically relevant question. Furthermore, our pilot study revealed that ablation of PXR blunts
VEGF receptor 3 signaling in lymphatic endothelial cells and reduces lymphatic button junction formation in
lacteals of PXR-deficient mice. It is completely unknow how lymphatic PXR regulates lipid absorption and
transport by gut lymphatic vessels. To unveil the aforementioned central mystery and to study the action mode
of PXR in mediating antipsychotic-elicited adverse effects on lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis, we
propose the following specific aims to determine the molecular mechanisms of the atherogenic effects of
atypical antipsychotics: 1) Define the enterocyte signaling through which PXR-activating antipsychotics
regulate lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis; 2) Determine the molecular mechanisms underlying PXR-
regulated lymphatic lipid absorption and transport in atherosclerosis; and 3) Investigate the therapeutic
potential of a naturally occurring PXR antagonist in preventing antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemia and
atherosclerosis. Successful completion of the proposed work will fill in the void in uncovering novel molecular
mechanisms underlying antipsychotic therapy-associated CVD risk. Our findings may also inaugurate new
class of therapeutic strategies to treat dyslipidemia in patients undergoing long-term antipsychotic therapy."
10808082,"ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are FDA approved for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and work
well for patients with high levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), but for the majority of BC patients, these
agents are ineffective. Continued research is needed to elucidate the interplay between tumor cells and the
diverse immune cell populations within the primary TME, and how this interaction shapes tumor biology. Tumor-
associated macrophages (TAM) represent one of the most abundant immune components in BC TME and exhibit
a robust and unique influence on the disease. High levels of TAM infiltration are associated with poor prognosis
in BC. TAMs play a critical role in a wide range of pro-tumorigenic, pro-metastatic activities including tumor
angiogenesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, immunosuppression, and chemoresistance. How to
surmount TAM infiltration and function in order to activate a potent anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic response
represents a gap in knowledge for the BC field. TAMs most closely resemble M2-polarized type macrophages
and exhibit some overlapping functions between the categories. TAMs are a highly heterogeneic, plastic cell
population endowed with tumor-promoting functionality measured by the overall abundance of M2 vs M1
markers. TAM polarization and immunosuppressive capacities are dependent upon where these cells are located
and what signals are received within the TME. Whereas M2-like polarization is considered pro-tumorigenic, M1-
like polarization is associated with inflammatory, anti-tumor effects and improved prognosis. Tumor cells
generate paracrine signals that recruit and regulate TAM function. In turn, TAMs produce signals that affect the
metastatic potential of tumor cells. Given the clear pro-tumor and metastatic roles of TAMs, it seems evident that
identifying ways to abrogate pro-tumorigenic M2-like responses and promote anti-tumorigenic M1-like responses
in BC will be clinically advantageous. However, effective strategies remain elusive. Our proposal introduces a
new strategy to target a kinase called HUNK that has the potential to be more advantageous than strategies that
directly target TAMs. Targeting HUNK will have a multifaceted effect by not only halting pro-tumor/metastatic
tumor intrinsic signaling but also fundamentally changing the “feed forward” paracrine loop between tumor cells
and TAMs."
10827900,"Project Summary/Abstract
Prostate cancer (CaP) will cause the deaths of more than 33,000 American men in 2020 because systemic
treatments for metastatic CaP fail. Actionable targets for novel treatments that work via entirely different
mechanisms, bypass resistance to current therapies, and control biology that drives CaP progression are needed
urgently to improve patient survival. The long-term goal is to target the mechanism(s) that control CaP cell
proliferation and CaP growth for therapeutic intervention. Our objective here is to derive the insights needed to
determine the feasibility and applicability of inhibiting the action of the mitotic kinase citron kinase (CIT) as novel
CaP treatment. We hypothesize that the mechanism(s) by which CIT, and its kinase activity, control CaP cell
proliferation can be exploited as alternative CaP treatment to overcome acquired resistance to conventional CaP
therapies. This hypothesis is formulated based on preliminary work produced in our laboratory, which identified
CIT and its kinase activity as a novel critical determinant of CaP growth. The rationale is that this work may lay
the foundation of a much-needed novel CaP therapeutic that targets specifically CaP growth during disease
progression. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing 3 Specific Aims: 1) to define the mechanism(s) that control
CIT protein expression, 2) to determine the manner in which CIT conveys aggressive CaP behavior, and 3) to
determine the therapeutic potential of targeting CIT during CaP progression. Aim 1 will use molecular biology
and cell biology approaches to delineate the molecular mechanism by which the novel E2F2-Skp2 signaling axis
induces CIT protein levels, and specifically the role of Skp2-mediated degradation of p27 herein. In Aim 2, we
will define the manner in which CIT conveys aggressive CaP behavior by isolating the CIT protein interactome
and CIT kinase substrates that mediate CaP cell proliferation. Integrated kinase substrate assays and proximity
ligation assays coupled with mass spectrometry will be performed. Aim 3 will define the therapeutic potential of
genetic or pharmacological CIT inhibition on the growth of CaP cell line xenografts, PDXs and fresh patient tissue
explants before and after ADT, and compare its efficacy to that achieved by the standard of care. The proposed
research is innovative because it focuses on an entirely different approach to CaP treatment: targeting the
action of a novel regulator of CaP growth to inhibit progression of advanced CaP and to bypass CaP treatment
resistance. This contribution is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected
to lead to the development of novel treatment modalities that target specifically the molecular mechanisms that
control lethal CaP progression. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed studies will delineate how
CIT controls CaP cell proliferation and establish its value as much-needed therapeutic target during CaP
progression. These results will have a significant positive impact because they will fundamentally advance
knowledge of the mechanisms that control CaP growth, in general, and provide CIT as an entirely new and
functionally distinct target for much-needed novel Cap treatments, specifically."
10771261,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and other disorders (ADRDs) is now a public health crisis. In the
absence of effective medical treatment, there is a critical need for behavioral interventions to prevent or delay
symptom onset. Multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risks for ADRD have
shown promise, but additional innovative approaches that could be highly accessible by capitalizing on user-
friendly digital applications to support and strengthen behavior modification are needed. Training in the use of
compensatory aids (e.g., calendars and note taking systems) can improve daily independence. These same
compensatory tools can be employed to facilitate the adoption of lifestyle changes that support brain health
(e.g., exercise, cognitive engagement, stress management) through management of goal-setting, behavioral
monitoring, tracking and feedback. The current project will test a 6-month intervention that provides training
in both compensatory aids and lifestyle modification. A comprehensive suite of digital tools encapsulated in the
Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), an easy to use, interactive application, will be used to facilitate behavioral
change and enhance participant motivation. Further, the DMN allows collection of real-time data to track
intervention adherence. The DMN has been successfully applied to improving compensation among
individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The proposed work capitalizes on a critical window for building
resilience by targeting individuals at risk for ADRD due to a subjective cognitive concern (SCC) but who remain
cognitively normal. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnoracially diverse older
adults with SCC to compare our digital app supported compensation training and lifestyle modification
intervention to an education only control group that will not use the DMN or be provided with guidance on
how to implement the educational material into their daily lives. Specific aims of the project include: 1)
evaluate intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (global cognition and everyday function); secondary
outcomes focus on well-being, cognitive domains (memory and executive function), activities of daily living
(IADLs), physical function, compensation, and health behaviors; 2) evaluate characteristics of treatment
responders; 3) evaluate adherence and identify the effective components of the target intervention using a
mixed-method approach; and 4) design machine learning algorithms that use patterns of change in real-time
DMN data metrics to identify incipient declines in treatment adherence and changes in health status. The
intervention under study is novel because it applies training in compensation to support lifestyle modifications
and everyday functioning using a digital app that also monitors adherence to each component of the
intervention in real-time. The project is expected to expand understanding of factors that may impact
adherence to and outcomes of a preventative intervention leading to optimization of a scalable intervention to
reduce dementia risk applicable to diverse populations."
10834085,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over half a million deaths in the United States alone. Even for
those individuals whose physical health and financial security have not been impacted, the
consequences of pandemic-induced isolation on mental and cognitive health may be far-reaching—
especially for our Veterans. Prior to the pandemic, approximately 10% of older Veterans reported
feeling lonely often and 40% indicated feeling lonely some of the time. Due to social distancing
guidelines and other measures that limit social contact, loneliness during the pandemic has likely
been far greater than these estimates. Decades of research have supported the protective effect of
social relationships on cognition in older adulthood; thus, the disruption of social support related to
the pandemic may impact cognitive function in the older Veteran population. To address this
possibility, we propose a prospective study to examine the relationships between isolation in the
pandemic and subsequent cognitive function in healthy older adult Veterans and in older Veterans
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Aim 1). In addition, forced isolation is likely not the only factor with
important consequences in the pandemic. We propose investigating two other pandemic-related
contexts that may either mitigate the effects of isolation in the pandemic or exacerbate the
consequences of cognitive impairment on health-related outcomes for older Veterans. First, older
Veterans may be able to cope with isolation through use of features of the built environment, such as
porches, window views, and public neighborhood space. However, the extent the built environment
may be able to mitigate pandemic-related loneliness in older adults is unknown. In Aim 2, we test the
hypothesis that built environment factors will mitigate or contribute to social isolation in older Veterans
with and without AD. In addition, individuals’ cognition may be impacted by their belief in
misconceptions related to social isolation itself. In Aim 3, we test the relationship between cognitive
function and the ability to correct misconceptions related to social isolation and AD—and whether
such corrections engender changes in behavior. To accomplish Aims 1-3, we will apply
questionnaires and neuropsychological tests administered during the first wave of the pandemic
(June 2020-June 2021) to 196 participants over three additional one-year time intervals from October
2022 to September 2025. In Aim 1, we will test the relationship between social isolation in the
pandemic and cognitive function one, two, and three years later. In Aim 2, we will test whether older
Veterans with fewer built environment resources will demonstrate a worsening of social isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, and cognition over time. In Aim 3, two objectives will be tested. First,
we will determine the extent that individuals with and without cognitive impairment due to AD can
successfully change their belief in misconceptions related to social isolation and AD through a
correction procedure over time. Second, we will test whether corrections related to changes in
behavior at delayed intervals of 1 and 2 years. Preliminary cross-sectional data from our already
recruited final sample of older adults (N=196) with and without AD support the relationships between
social isolation and cognitive impairment (Aim 1), the built environment and social isolation (Aim 2),
and cognitive impairment and misconception correction (Aim 3). As the ramifications of the pandemic
continue to unfold for years—possibly decades—it is imperative that we understand the relationship
between social isolation and future cognitive impairment in Veterans with and without Alzheimer’s
disease."
10810672,"ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States, and its
incidence is expected to grow by more than 50% by 2030. If detected early, the survival of women can be
substantially increased compared to late-stage detection. Ultrasound molecular imaging, using molecularly-
targeted contrast microbubbles, is a promising technique for the early detection of breast cancer, particularly in
women with radiographically dense breast. In ultrasound molecular imaging, a molecularly-targeted ligand
attached to a microbubble can bind to proteins expressed on the tumor neovasculature and produce contrast
that can identify cancer early. This approach has large potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy of
ultrasound and noninvasive characterization of focal breast lesions. The keys to successful ultrasound molecular
imaging in this regard are: (1) having a molecular target that is highly specific to breast cancer, and (2) having a
sensitive imaging system that can correctly visualize the microbubbles bound to breast cancer and differentiate
those bubbles from background tissue. In addition, the system must integrate well with existing ultrasound
imaging technology so as to be practically distributable to existing breast imaging clinics.
In this application, we propose to build a real-time ultrasound molecular imaging platform that consisting of a
novel ultrasound contrast imaging technology that is targeted to a newly identified biomarker of breast cancer.
We propose to utilize targeted microbubbles to enhance the contrast signal and improve the sensitivity of the
imaging system and propose to conjugate these microbubbles with a high-affinity affibody targeted to the B7-H3
biomarker, which is a vascular biomarker highly specific to breast cancer, and is not expressed in benign disease
processes. In addition, our preliminary results demonstrate that this biomarker may potentially allow for the
detection of metastatic disease at the time of imaging, potentially enabling the ability to image the extent of
metastatic disease prior to treatment decisions. The real-time imaging technology in this proposal is based on a
neural network design for contrast imaging that requires low computational resources and avoids destruction
of bubbles, and enable real-time imaging of the targeted contrast agent. During this project, we will optimize the
ultrasound parameters of these B7-H3 targeted microbubbles for breast ultrasound imaging frequencies and will
utilize conjugation chemistry for the microbubbles to permit the potential for future clinical translation of the B7-
H3-targeted microbubbles. We will design and construct this ultrasound molecular imaging platform (non-
destructive imaging system plus monodisperse B7-H3-targeted microbubbles) and thoroughly test it in
phantoms, in vitro flow chambers, and several preclinical animal models of primary and metastatic breast cancer."
10748414,"Various forms of chronic distress have been linked with premature aging, and development of cardiometabolic
diseases (CMD), which are leading causes of death for older adults. Both chronic distress and CMD conditions
are strongly linked with risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
While metabolic changes affecting vascular health are proposed as a key pathway driving the relationship
between chronic distress and major diseases of aging, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying
such metabolic changes is limited. High-throughput technologies permit simultaneous measurement of
hundreds of metabolites in plasma (“metabolomics”) and provide a broad picture of an individual’s metabolic
profile. In our first funding cycle, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic score of chronic distress (anxiety and depression), in independent
data sets of largely non-Hispanic White women; this score was associated with higher risk of incident CMD. In
this renewal, using cutting edge metabolomic and biostatistical approaches along with several additional cohort
studies, we propose to extend our initial findings and address the following specific aims: (1) Strengthen our
existing chronic distress metabolite-score by adding novel, previously unknown metabolites strongly
associated with the distress phenotype, and biochemically identify these validated but unknown metabolites to
provide new mechanistic insight; (2) Assess our chronic distress metabolomic score (and its components) in
key populations including African-American (AA) and Hispanic men and women and White men, and optimize
the score in each population. We will also evaluate associations of the score (and components) with CMD and
secondarily AD/ADRD risk in AA men and women, White men, and preliminarily in Hispanic men and women,
and (3) Evaluate if chronic distress influences the distress-related metabolite score using causal methods and
evaluate the distress-metabolite score as a potential mediator of the relationships of chronic distress with CMD
risk and secondarily with AD/ADRD risk. We will achieve our aims by leveraging the robust data resources of
five prospective studies: the Jackson Heart Study (n=5,306; 100% AA men and women), the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (n=6,814; 39% White, 28% AA, 22% Hispanic, 12% Asian-American men and
women), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; n=121,700, 98% White women), the Women’s Health Initiative
(n=161,808 women; 18% non-White), PREDIMED (n=7,447; White men and women). Each cohort has
similarly assessed chronic distress, blood metabolomic profiles, relevant covariates, CMD and dementia risk
outcomes over up to 20 years of follow-up. NHS and MESA also have genetics data and repeated
metabolomics measures. This work will extend our understanding of biologic pathways underlying chronic

10583622,"Chronic lung diseases (CLDs), including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial
lung disease (ILD), cause significant functional limitation and disability and were, collectively, the 4th leading
cause of death in the United States in 2019. Veterans are enriched for environmental exposures which contribute
to the pathogenesis of CLDs (e.g., smoking, environmental toxins) and have a higher burden of CLD relative to
the general population. However, significant heterogeneity in CLD development and progression exists.
Investigations into the genomic contributions towards CLD susceptibility within the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) have been limited by the lack of robust CLD phenotypes. Key challenges in [clinically-
based] CLD phenotyping include the lack of blood-based biomarkers, variable implementation of diagnostic
testing (e.g., underutilization of spirometry), and inconsistent availability of testing results in the VA electronic
health record (EHR). These barriers result in frequent misclassification and present challenges in identifying
controls as well as cases for large-scale epidemiological and genomic studies.
 To address these knowledge gaps, we propose a multi-faceted approach to CLD phenotyping and
validation, followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), construction of polygenic risk scores, and
examinations of gene-by-environment interactions including pharmacogenomics within the Million Veteran
Program (MVP). First, we have developed a novel natural language processing (NLP)-boosted EHR-based
phenotyping algorithm which will generate quantitative probabilities for the presence and absence of multiple
CLDs (COPD, emphysema subtype, asthma, interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), fibrosis subtype) for all VHA
users (~16.8 million) through 2018. Following algorithm optimization and internal validation against 500 gold
standard charts (already adjudicated in duplicate), prospective validation using mortality and respiratory-related
healthcare utilization data collected after 2018 will be performed (Aim 1). Second, we propose independent
phenotyping through quantitative imaging analysis (QIA) of chest computed tomography (CT) data available in
a subset of participants enrolled in MVP (Aim 2). In preliminary work, a secure prototype pipeline behind the VA
firewall for the analysis of archived clinical chest CT data using VA Technical Reference Manual (TRM)-approved
software platforms (3D Slicer, Chest Imaging Platform13,14) has been established. For the current proposal,
through a national network of collaborating VA pulmonary investigators (J. Curtis, VISN10; C. Wendt VISN23;
V. Fan VISN20; C. Wells VISN7; F. Kheradmand, VISN16), full-resolution clinical chest CT data from a subgroup
of individuals enrolled in MVP (n=6,000-9,000) will be analyzed to generate objective, quantitative
measurements of parenchymal lung disease (e.g., percent emphysema and ILA). Each of these QIA-based
phenotypes will be (i) validated against prospective mortality and healthcare utilization outcomes (available from
Aim 1) (ii) utilized as an independent secondary validation of EHR algorithm-derived emphysema, ILA, and
fibrosis (from Aim 1), and (iii) as a distinct, quantitative phenotype in genomic investigations (Aim 3). Third, we
propose to (i) conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the MVP using EHR-algorithm assigned
CLD case-control status (Aim 1) and QIA-phenotypes (Aim 2), (ii) construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each
CLD, and (iii) examine gene-by-environment [and pharmacogenomic] interactions in CLDs (Aim 3). Findings will
be replicated in independent cohorts: International COPD Genetics Consortium (ICGC) and UK Biobank (COPD,
emphysema), Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health (GERA) and Mass General Brigham Biobank
(asthma), and an international cohort investigating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ILA, fibrosis). Upon successful
completion of the project, we will have developed and validated robust phenotypes and identified risk loci for
CLDs which will shed light on disease mechanisms and have the potential to serve as the foundation of
personalized medicine initiatives for CLD management within the VHA."

Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacteria that is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted
infection. Despite effective antibiotic treatment and screening programs, the prevalence of chlamydia continues
to rise. Although the infection can be asymptomatic, some women experience serious long-term sequelae,
including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. For these reasons, a prophylactic
vaccine against chlamydia is needed. However, significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the natural immune
response to urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection. In particular, the specificity of antibodies elicited during
infection, their functions, and their protective capacity are not well understood. The overall goal of this research
is to design prophylactic antibody-eliciting vaccines against urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The
objective of this proposal is to define the range of protective functions antibodies can have against Chlamydia
trachomatis infection of the female urogenital tract, and use this knowledge to create vaccines that can elicit
those antibodies. Our working hypothesis is that antibody responses that target proteins known to be involved
in adhesion and entry into host cells or mediate pathology in the reproductive tract will be protective against
urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection. In Aim 1, we will engineer epitope-specific vaccine candidates that
will elicit high titer antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis adhesion factors and define their immunogenicity in
mouse immunization studies. In Aim 2, we will investigate the specific functions of vaccine-elicited antibodies to
neutralize Chlamydia trachomatis infection in cell culture, mediate complement killing of Chlamydia trachomatis,
and facilitate uptake and killing by neutrophils. In Aim 3, we will investigate the protective capacity of our vaccines
in mouse models of Chlamydia infection. We will investigate the bacterial burden in the upper reproductive tract,
bacterial shedding, pathology, and male urogenital tract infection. Overall, these studies will define the role of
epitope-specific antibodies in urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection and lead to the identification of novel
targets for Chlamydia trachomatis vaccine design."

Dermatomyositis (DM) is a complex immune-mediated systemic condition affecting children and adults for
which there are few approved treatments. The mainstay of treatment includes high-dose corticosteroids, which
are associated with long-term steroid-related damage. While mortality has improved since the introduction of
corticosteroids, over 60% of children and 80% of adults with DM, still experience long-term functional
impairment, highlighting the need for improved therapies. Refractory skin disease is especially difficult to treat
with only ~1/3 of patients attaining clinical remission. However, DM-specific therapeutic development has been
hindered because of the rarity of the disease, few preclinical animal models, and the time and cost associated
with traditional drug development pipelines. To circumvent these barriers and identify precision medicine
treatments for DM, we propose a novel computational drug repositioning strategy to identify existing
compounds that target perturbed molecular networks in DM-associated cell types using a combination of
single-cell network analyses, transcriptomic-based computational drug repurposing, and ex-vivo cell culture
assays in PBMCs and skin. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify the cell-specific immune pathways dysregulated
in juvenile DM PBMCs and DM skin compared to healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing.
In Specific Aim 2, we will apply transcriptomic-based computational drug repurposing to identify single agent
and combination therapies that target cell-specific immune signatures in peripheral blood and skin.
In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the effects of predicted single agent and combination therapies on
immune cell activation using ex-vivo PBMC and skin culture assays.
We expect the summary of this work to advance knowledge of DM pathogenesis at the cellular level and to
rapidly identify compounds that can be repurposed for the treatment of DM with the long-term goal of improving
disease outcomes. The candidate’s career goal is to become a translational researcher and computational
immunologist investigating the immune dysregulation of rheumatic diseases to inform precision medicine
approaches to care. In this K08 proposal, the candidate has developed a career development plan, which
requests training in advanced single cell analysis methods, computational drug repurposing, and translational
immunology to gain the skills needed to achieve this goal. The candidate is trained in Pediatric Rheumatology
and holds a faculty position at the University of California, San Francisco. The candidate has assembled a
mentorship and advisory team with expertise in integrative bioinformatics, basic immunology, skin immunology,
systems biology, translational research, and clinical trials. The scientific environment at this institution, superb
mentorship and advisory team supporting the candidate, and proposed research aims will enable the
candidate’s transition to an independent career as a physician scientist dedicated to developing precision
medicine approaches to care for people with rare rheumatic conditions."
10819130,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The development of heart is a complicated developmental process that requires precise and coordinated spatial
and temporal regulation in gene transcription. Epigenetic factors, such as the Ten-eleven Translocation (TET)
family of dioxygenase that catalyzes 5-methyocytosine (5mC) oxidation, play indispensable roles in orchestrating
the cardiac transcription network during normal heart development. Tet depletion has been shown by others and
us to block the differentiation of embryonic stem cells toward cardiac progenitor ex vivo. The team has further
established that cardiac specific Tet deletion could result in noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) due to
dysregulation of chromatin accessibility and impaired long-range enhancer-promoter looping that disrupts the
transcription of genes important for cardiac development. More recently, the team further discovered that Tet
deficient embryonic heart tissues exhibited abnormal expression of genes that are important for lipid metabolism,
which might also count for developmental defects observed in cardiac specific Tet-deficient mouse models.
Despite the knowledges obtained from these studies, two outstanding questions remain unresolved: (i) how Tet
proteins acquire their specificity to precisely regulate lineage-specific enhancers; and (ii) whether and how
prenatal maternal metabolic stressors influence TET-related epigenetic pathways and impact cardiac
development in the progeny. In this research program, the PI will use both unique genetically modified mouse
models and human embryonic stem cells differentiated toward the cardiac lineage to address these questions.
In project 1, the team will investigate the pathogenic mechanisms regarding how newly discovered TET2
mutations in patients with congenital heart diseases (CHD) impair heart development and cardiac lineage
specification. In project 2, the team will unravel molecular mechanisms undergirding TET-mediated enhancer
recognition specificity during heart development. In project 3, the team will illuminate how prenatal maternal high
fat diet as a stressor effects Tet mediated epigenetic regulation to perturb cardiac development. From a
translational perspective, we will test the use of vitamin C to boost Tet activity and reduce the risk of
developmental defects related to maternal high fat-diet exposure. The proposed fundamental studies are
necessary to promote healthy cardiac development and illuminate previously underappreciated mechanisms
underpinning CHDs and cardiovascular diseases. This proposal will also lend insight into how external
metabolites influence epigenetic landscapes during heart development and how metabolic factors can be
harnessed to rectify epigenetic abnormalities to restore normal cardiac development."
10757008,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Visual impairment (VI) and cognitive impairment are chronic conditions that disproportionately affect older
adults. Research has revealed a consistent relationship between VI and cognitive impairment and dementia in
older adults. VI is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and is associated with future cognitive decline.
However, the extent to which VI is associated with the characteristics of the longitudinal cognitive trajectory of
aging adult remains unclear, particularly how VI status in midlife affects the cognitive trajectory in older life.
Additionally, the mechanisms through which VI affects cognitive functioning have not been well elucidated. VI
and cognitive decline could both be the result of a common underlying cause such as brain neurodegeneration.
Alternatively, VI may reduce older adults’ ability to participate in activities and engage socially, which become
risk factors for cognitive decline. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors influence the risk of both VI and
cognitive outcomes which may serve as important etiologic pathways underlying cognitive impairment.
Important genetic factors such as APOE ε4 which is positively associated with AD has been demonstrated to
be related to certain cerebrovascular diseases and visual disorders. These important and complex
associations among VI, CVD risk factors, brain neurodegeneration, APOE ε4 genotype and cognitive decline
have not been studied in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The current proposal leverages two large
epidemiological cohort (The Health ABC Study and UK Biobank) and presents an unprecedented opportunity
to employ sophisticated and novel application of Structure Equation Modeling techniques to investigate the
complex associations between VI, brain neurodegeneration, CVD risk factors, APOE ε4 genotype, and
sociopsychological factors as they relate to the longitudinal trajectories of cognitive decline and the linking
mechanisms between VI and cognitive decline. The research in this career development award is
complemented by training activities that build on the candidate’s strong background in statistics and provides
new trainings on 1) cognitive neurosciences and clinical assessment of normal aging, cognitive impairment and
AD; 2) cerebrovascular disease and risk factors and their relevant disease mechanisms and consequences; 3)
neuroimaging and markers of brain neurodegeneration; 4) clinical aspects of VI and conducting ocular
epidemiological study. This sophisticated research and training plan combined with a highly experienced and
committed mentorship team will facilitate acquisition of meaningful skills and foster the applicant’s development
into an independent investigator. This research will answer the important question of whether VI is associated
with accelerated downward trajectories of cognitive decline and will elucidate critical underlying mechanisms
linking VI with cognitive decline. The treatment for AD and ADRD is currently very limited. VI is a prevalent
condition that is highly treatable and represents an important modifiable risk factor that can be prevented and
treated as an effective means to preserve cognitive function and improve quality of life."

The development of more powerful primate models of auditory cognitive control is critical for
advancing understanding of the cognitive and neural systems underlying the capacity for human
communication. Valid models depend on identification of which aspects of these systems are
present in monkeys. The long-term goal of this work is to better understand the relations
between auditory cognitive control in humans and primates, enhancing the utility of primate
models for research on auditory-communicative disorders. The overall objective of this
application is to identify some aspects of auditory cognitive control in humans that can be
modeled in primates. The central working hypothesis is that the same experimental techniques
used to establish visual cognitive control can also elucidate components of auditory cognitive
control. The rationale is that valid behavioral models of auditory cognitive control in primates are
foundational for studies of the relevant neural systems, and ultimately for developing and testing
novel treatments for individuals with communication disorders. The central hypothesis will be
tested by accomplishing three specific aims: (1) Use tests that are diagnostic of working
memory to determine which components of human auditory working memory can be modeled in
rhesus monkeys, (2) Assess cognitive control of auditory attention and decision-making in
monkeys, and (3) Evaluate a putative neural substrate of auditory cognitive control using
comparative studies across humans, orangutans, and monkeys. For the first aim, whether
monkeys engage in active maintenance of information in auditory working memory will be tested
using competing cognitive load and directed forgetting manipulations in auditory memory tests.
For the second aim, control of auditory attention will be evaluated using tasks that require
flexibly focusing auditory attention and filtering auditory distractors. Cognitive control of
decision-making will be evaluated using tests of adaptive information-seeking. For the third aim,
auditory cognitive abilities will be compared across monkeys, orangutans, and humans to
evaluate the putative correlation between these skills and expansion of the dorsal auditory
pathway. The proposed research is innovative because it uses novel tests of auditory working
memory, attentional control, and adaptive decision-making that specifically dissociate these
processes from non-controlled, passive, or automatic mechanisms. The work also achieves a
systematic comparison of auditory memory across primates using equivalent tests. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a robust foundation for future
biomedical research on auditory-communicative deficits using proven primate models."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes 33,700 US cancer cases per year, 4,000 deaths and $4 billion in cancer-
related medical costs. Despite an effective vaccine, in 2020 less than 60% of US adolescents 13-17 years of
age completed their HPV vaccine series. Key barriers are suboptimal clinician communication to address
parental vaccine hesitancy, and ineffective office systems causing missed opportunities for vaccination.
Our research team tested two promising implementation strategies (ISs) in primary care practices to address
these barriers: online clinician communication training (“STOP-HPV-Online”) which trains clinicians on
communication techniques and addresses parent hesitancy, and a multi-component IS (“STOP-HPV-LC”) that
involves both clinician communication training plus office-based changes in workflow learned on monthly learning
collaborative group phone calls. Both ISs were deployed by our research team. Widespread scalability requires
the ISs to be deployed by health systems since most primary care practices are now part of health systems.
For Aim 1 we will adapt the two ISs for deployment by 8 health systems, and also describe baseline strategies
used by these systems. We will partner with the American Medical Group Association® (AMGA),the main national
organization of health systems. More than 8 health systems have already expressed interest in the study. We
will use a mixed-methods approach and the RE-Aim/PRISM framework to evaluate the effectiveness and
implementation processes of the health-system deployed implementation strategies. We will assess how health
systems deploy core IS functions and how they and practices adapt specific activities (forms) within each IS.
Aims 2-3 will use a 3-arm clustered RCT, randomizing 72 practices within the 8 health systems to STOP-HPV-
Online, STOP-HPV-LC, or usual care control. Aim 2 will compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
the two ISs to control and to each other over a 12-month IS period and another 12-month maintenance period.
The primary outcome for Aim 2 is HPV vaccine initiation; secondary outcomes are vaccine series completion
and cost-effectiveness of the IS.
Aim 3 will assess provider, practice, and health system factors relevant to implementation of the two ISs. The
primary outcome is adoption (uptake of core IS functions such as clinicians completing the online modules);
secondary outcomes include reach (e.g., % clinicians participating), practice/provider factors (e.g.,
organizational readiness) associated with improvement in rates, and maintenance of core IS functions by
practices over 12 additional months. We will develop and disseminate online implementation guides for health
systems and practices to use, and AMGA will help spread the ISs to their other health systems.
By the end of the study, we will have two scalable ISs for AMGA and any health system to improve HPV
vaccination rates and reduce HPV-related cancers."

 Our overarching goal is to utilize biology-based mathematical models and advanced molecular imaging
to dramatically decrease systemic toxicities while either maintaining or accelerating tumor control in
preclinical models of breast cancer. Advances in systemic therapies have improved long-term survival in patients
with locally-advanced breast cancer, however there has been a concomitant increase in the associated their
long-term side effects, including cognitive deficits and cardiac problems. We have developed practical, biology-
based mathematical models capable of systematically investigating the timing, order, dosing, and sequencing of
combination therapies to identify therapeutic regimens that can potentially maximize response while minimizing
toxicity. Preliminary results (both experimental and mathematical) reveal that alternating the order and dosing of
combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin) and targeted therapy (Herceptin) can significantly and synergistically
enhance response while reducing the chemotherapy dose by 50%. Furthermore, using optimal control theory,
we have identified therapeutic regimens suggesting we can achieve tumor control 1.6x faster without increasing
the amount of chemotherapy. We propose to develop the mathematical formalism that allows for systematically
determining, on a patient specific basis, therapeutic regimens that maximize tumor response and minimize side
effects. We then select the most promising options and test them experimentally against established treatment
regimens and test for superior outcomes and toxicity. We also seek to develop quantitative imaging technologies
capable of characterizing the temporal alterations in brain and cardiac function—organs known to be adversely
affected by chemotherapies. We plan to achieve this goal with the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will validate
mathematical predictions for maintaining tumor control with minimal chemotherapy dose by employing optimal
control theory to identify and biologically validate (with immunohistochemistry and overall tumor burden
measurements) the three most promising combination treatment strategies. Aim 2 will implement advanced
molecular imaging to quantify toxicity changes in critical organs during therapy by employing cardiac imaging of
membrane potential (18F-TTP+-PET) and brain imaging of microglia activation (TSPO, measured with 18F-DPA-
714-PET) to determine longitudinal differences between long-term effects in animals treated with the standard
and the optimized regimens. Completion of these aims will deliver a practical, experimental-computational
approach for identifying optimal treatment strategies in pre-clinical mouse models, and appropriate for
prospective testing in phase 1 clinical trials. As toxicity is the main dose-limiting factor in cancer treatments,
developing methods to control it will dramatically effect patient health."
10771254,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Decades of research using laboratory mice and rats have revealed mechanisms of human development
and disease. It is highly likely that rodents have provided critical supporting data for clinical trials of every
pharmaceutical or therapeutic approach currently used to improve human health. There are, however,
limitations to the utility of mice and rats to understand and model complex genetic problems (e.g. Alzheimer's,
heart disease, and diabetes) due to the rare probability of inheriting desired alleles at four or more loci and the
small litter size compared to offspring of other traditional model species.
 The cost, time, and number of animals needed to model complex genetic traits would be reduced by an
approach to increase the probability one of the two alleles at multiple loci will be transmitted to the next
generation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene conversion, which is feasible in mice, can perhaps accomplish
exactly this goal by copying genetic information from a donor to a recipient allele in the germline. Briefly, this
occurs by germline-restricted expression of genetically encoded Cas9 and a guide RNA (gRNA) that targets
only the recipient and not the donor allele. If the double strand break in the recipient allele is repaired by
interchromosomal homology directed repair, the recipient allele is replaced by the donor allele. CRISPR/Cas9-
mediated gene conversion therefore changes the genotype of the cell from heterozygous to homozygous and
ensures any resulting sperm or egg will transmit only the donor allele.
 The proposed objectives will build on proof-of-feasibility to improve the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9
mediated gene conversion in the female and male mouse germline and to test the efficiency of gene
conversion at two loci in the same cell. Previous work suggests a high level of Cas9 expression timed to initiate
during early meiosis I is necessary for efficient gene conversion in both sexes. Aim1 of this proposal seeks to
apply this knowledge to develop and test three BAC transgenic drivers of Cas9 expression using regulatory
sequences of the meiotic genes Tex12, Prdm9, and Rad51ap2. To date, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
conversion has been assessed at one locus – Tyrosinase. Aim 2 seeks to quantify the efficiency of gene
conversion at two additional loci individually and of two loci together in the same cell. Mathematical models
predict the efficiency of multi-locus gene conversion, but empirical evidence is required to determine whether
the actual efficiency follows a `multiplicative' or `coordinated' probability. The outcomes of this research are
critical to maximize the utility and future biological impact of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene conversion
approaches to model and solve a variety of genetically complex challenges to human health."

10773098,"Project Summary: Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality with almost 50 million cases per
year worldwide. In the absence of FDA-approved drugs, there is a high demand for better insights into the host-
microbe interactions that define the molecular pathogenesis of sepsis. Polyphosphates are linear polymers of
inorganic phosphate (Pi) residues that are present in all living organisms. The metabolism of bacteria
accumulates long-chains of polyphosphates (Pi: n≥1,000) in contrast to the short-chain polyphosphates (Pi:
n<100) typically found in mammalian cells. The biologic effects are dependent on chain length. Emerging data
suggest that short-chain polyphosphates modulate blood coagulation and inflammation, while the role of long-
chain, bacteria-derived, polyphosphates in sepsis is an understudied research field. Our preliminary work
suggests that neutralization of polyphosphates or bacterial polyphosphate deficiency improves survival of
peritoneal sepsis induced by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice. In sterile macrophage cultures, long-
chain polyphosphates modulate LPS/TLR4-induced macrophage polarization, iNOS expression and immuno-
metabolism. Here, we propose to test the central hypothesis that bacterial polyphosphates are lethal metabolites
in sepsis because of their detrimental interference with the innate host response to infection. To shed light into
the biological activities of polyphosphates, we propose to address 3 specific aims: (1) To study the effects of
polyphosphate neutralization, we will use a recombinant exopolyphosphatase (PPX) protein and characterize its
activities on the host response to polymicrobial CLP sepsis. A single-cell proteogenomics approach (CITE-Seq)
will aim to capture the heterogeneity/polarization of invading professional phagocytes as a function of
polyphosphates. The polyphosphates will be measured in sepsis samples of mice and humans. (2) To
characterize the direct interference of polyphosphates with the functions of cultured macrophages, we will
combine bacterial TLR agonists with synthetic polyphosphates of different chain length. It will be studied if
polyphosphates curb STAT/IRF signaling pathways for modulating iNOS, L-arginase, cytokines/chemokines,
and metabolic reprogramming (OXPHOS, glycolysis). In addition, affinity purification combined with label-free
proteomics will aim for the identification of novel polyphosphate targeted proteins in macrophages; to better
understand the mechanisms how polyphosphates interfere with phagocyte responses in sepsis. (3) In gnotobiotic
mice, monocolonized with a polyphosphate-deficient E. coli mutant (Δppk), we will investigate how bacteria-
derived polyphosphates shape innate immunity before and after monomicrobial CLP sepsis. Peritoneal and
intestinal mucosal macrophages will be characterized and compared for their functions, transcriptome plasticity
and immuno-metabolic phenotypes. This research project will provide novel insights into the unexplored activities
of bacterial polyphosphates within the networks of host-pathogen interactions of sepsis and may ultimately
advance strategies for therapeutic reversal of maladaptive inflammatory milieus."
10798135,"Which psychiatric symptoms and behaviors are the most important to assess and manage during critical
 points in psychiatric healthcare, such as the time leading up to hospital discharge? At present, psychiatry
 lacks objective tests that could inform this and other clinically challenging–and potentially costly–
 decisions. Establishing valid objective markers of psychiatric disease processes is especially challenging
 compared with the development of biomarkers in other 5elds. One key challenge is lack of available data
 from psychiatrically ill patients during key periods in their care trajectory, which the present project seeks
 to address. A second major challenge, also addressed as a core feature in this project, is the complex,
 context-dependence of human behavioral expression, which greatly complicates efforts to establish
 robust, objective measures that re6ect underlying mental health disease processes. This project will
 address both barriers, introducing a new computational framework, named Context-Adaptive Multimodal
 Informatics, to identify and evaluate behavioral biomarkers related to discharge-readiness and
 symptoms in severe mental illness. The project aims to address 5ve fundamental research challenges:
 (1) Acquire a multimodal psychiatric discharge-planning dataset of 400 inpatients with severe mental
 illness; (2) Create self-aware linear and neural models to identify multimodal behavioral biomarkers; (3)
 Develop context-sensitive linear and neural models to contextualize behavioral biomarkers and quantify
 the in6uence of context on behavior; (4) Build a new adaptive assessment planning framework which
 creates a personalized patient analysis to rank contexts and modalities for the next assessment session;
 (5) Assess the trustworthiness and generalizability of our measurements, models, and insights.
 This research will improve basic understanding of social context and behavioral biomarkers, build
 objective measures for mental health assessment, and more broadly, pave the way for a restructured

 informative with respect to desired clinical objectives."
10792489,"Project Summary
 The central goal of this project is to advance the therapeutic application and the development of an
exciting novel neuroprosthetic technology, Safe Direct Current Stimulation (SDCS). Direct current (DC)
compared to biphasic charge balanced pulses normally used by neural prostheses to interface to the nervous
system, can more naturally control neural activity. Unlike biphasic current pulses used to excite neurons, DC can
excite, inhibit, and modulate sensitivity of neurons. However using DC for implantable prosthetic applications
has not been possible due to the DC’s inherent violation of the charge injection safety constraints at the metal
electrode interfaces. Safe DC overcomes these constraints and opens a new avenue for research into
exciting possibilities of using DC to interface to the nervous system.
 We will optimize the use of SDCS to improve the performance of the vestibular prosthetic for balance
disorders. This type of neural implant is designed to deliver the sensation of head motion directly to the vestibular
nerve for those suffering from bilateral vestibular dysfunction. We obtained preliminary data in a chinchilla animal
model showing that using DC in contrast to the more conventional pulsatile stimulation can dramatically increase
the range of head velocities that can be encoded by the device. Here we propose to consider biological safety
of long-duration SDCS prosthetic stimulation, and advance the technology SDCS toward primate implantation.
 Aim 1) Conduct acute behavioral studies in nonhuman primates.
 Aim 2) Determine whether prolonged DC delivery from the SDCS causes physiologic or histologic signs
of damage in chinchillas.
 Aim 3) Develop a three channel SDCS, lead, and DCtubes designed for future primate chronic vestibular
implant studies."
10754275,"ABSTRACT:
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease with few effective treatments. The poor efficacy of
current therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is partly attributed to the characteristic
fibroinflammatory desmoplastic tumor microenvironment. Thus, strategies that overcome these stromal barriers
have the potential to profoundly improve therapeutic outcomes in PDA. Towards this end, epigenetic therapies
that broadly rewire cellular gene expression programs represent a promising approach for targeting PDA stromal
barriers. Preliminary studies with inhibitors of Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) proteins, whose
recognition of enhancer and super-enhancers drive cell-specific function, reveal a potent loss of
immunosuppressive programs within multiple stromal cell populations as well as tumor cells. In addition, the
clinical BET inhibitor OTX-015 (OTX) synergized with otherwise ineffective αPD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition
to promote intra-tumoral cytotoxic T cell activation and decrease PDA tumor burden. However, OTX negatively
impacts T cell priming in secondary lymphoid tissue and long-term treatment is limited by systemic toxicities. To
overcome these limitations, this proposal will develop bottlebrush polymer prodrug (BPDs) to selectively deliver
drug cargoes to PDA tumors. BPDs are small, cylindrical macromolecules with multiple conjugated drugs within
their cores. This unique architecture enables improved tissue penetration and predictable properties independent
of drug composition, while molecular linkers facilitate highly selective drug release in target tissues. In Aim 1, the
ability of OTX-BPD conjugates incorporating cleavable linkers to selectively deliver drugs to tumors will be
evaluated in clinically relevant PDA mouse models. Subsequently, the ability of lead OTX-BPDs to synergize
with αPD-L1 will be determined in both short-term intervention and long-term survival studies. The therapeutic
utility of conjugating multiple drugs to BPDs will be determined in Aim 2. Specifically, chemotherapeutics found
to synergize with OTX as free drugs will be conjugated to OTX-BPDs, and the abilities of these multidrug laden
BPDs to reduce tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immunity in combination with αPD-L1 will be determined
in PDA mouse models. In parallel, the therapeutic benefits of actively targeting these multidrug-laden BPDs by
conjugating to antibodies that recognize PDA cancer cell proteins will be assessed. In addition, the optimal ratio
of drugs conjugated to individual BPDs to achieve maximal efficacy will be established, which will be distinct
from free drugs. In combination, the development of targeted multidrug-laden BPDs will promote rational
combination therapies that leverage both epigenetic- and chemo-therapies to potentiate immune checkpoint
inhibitors. In the third aim, BPD reporters for drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxic T cell activity will be developed
by incorporating metal-free MRI organic radical contrast agents. These reporter BPDs will be used to validate

BPDs to rapidly report on treatment efficacies has the potential to inform subsequent treatment decisions."
10754870,"The lifetime risk of stroke is 1 in 6 with an estimated 33 million stroke survivors worldwide. Ideally acute
stroke patients would receive an accurate and rapid prognosis regarding return of motor function, followed
by application of those therapies most able to improve it. Yet decisions regarding post-acute treatment of
stroke patients are made on short-term assessments of function that may be influenced by concurrent
treatment, time-of-day, motivation, and other factors. Those assessments are often delayed, with resultant
delays in rehabilitation treatments. There are important decisions that need to be made about the setting
where rehabilitation occurs, if it is needed, and where the stroke patient will best live in the long-term. This
research project aims to significantly add to the current understanding of biomarkers that can be used to
provide better diagnosis, rehabilitative treatment, and long-term disposition advice for veterans who
experience upper-extremity impairments from stroke. The gaps in knowledge we aim to address are the
unknown relationships between 1. immediate post-stroke movement and functional ability, and 2. between
sympathetic tone and psychological response to disability. Clinicians do not yet know how to use the data
from wearable technologies that measure these factors – a problem caused by the volume of data generated
and lack of reliable biomarkers derived from it. Our central hypothesis is that application of machine
learning techniques to data from a multimodal sensor array worn by a patient for multiple hours can
provide better evidence of motor ability, assess latent psychological factors, and predict recovery trajectory
better than conventional short-term assessments. It may also allow more rapid personalization of therapy
plans based on real-world deficits discovered through sensor-based data. We will test our central hypothesis
by pursuing the two following specific aims with associated working hypotheses:
 1. Collect functionally relevant data from a wearable inertial, electromyographic, and
electrodermal sensor array. Working Hypothesis: A few strategically placed sensors can capture
functional movement and state of the autonomic nervous system. Kinematic and physiological measures
taken during task performance will be correlated with motor impairment and functional status. Completion
of this aim will lead to the identification of functional variables derived from multimodal sensor
measurements and demonstrate the feasibility of, and challenges to, inpatient use of a sensor array.
 2. Predict key clinical outcomes from sensor array-derived variables in acute stroke
inpatients being evaluated for post-discharge therapies. Working Hypothesis: Machine learning
techniques, including Bayesian fusion, will predict deficits and discharge disposition from the multimodal
variables collected. The electrodermal response to challenging movement is an unexplored area that may
provide insight into motivation and affective response to impairment. The trajectory of recovery may be
captured during a two-day sampling period. Overall low activation of the affected arm and lack of affective
responses to challenging movement will be related to poorer recovery and discharge disposition.
 The modalities that will be measured by wearable sensors in this study are: acceleration, surface
muscle electrical activity, and galvanic skin responses. We will acquire data using a suite of sensors from a
single manufacturer, aiding the synchronization and convenience of collecting a time-series of data during
daily life in the hospital, as well as during motor tasks and assessments. Biomarkers will be extracted using
the Bayesian fusion algorithm, and outcomes will be both motor function and discharge disposition.
 At the conclusion of this project we will have demonstrated that the proposed sensor array can
provide meaningful data regarding movement ability, affective response to motor challenges, and will have
explored the relationship between that data and discharge disposition."
10774273,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer in the U.S and increasing in
frequency. Veterans who served in Vietnam where herbicides like Agent Orange were sprayed may have
increased risk of developing MM. Early-stage disease is often asymptomatic, so patients are diagnosed late,
with bone pain, kidney dysfunction and infections. Although there has been progress in developing new
therapies for MM, it remains incurable. Patients initially achieve remission but ultimately relapse. The disease
returns more quickly, tumor cells become more resistant to treatment and the patient’s quality of life declines.
 Natural killer (NK) cells kill MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Clinical trials using NK cell-based immunotherapy
are ongoing but not widely available. Several drugs for MM (bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide) sensitize
MM cells to NK-mediated lysis and/or enhance NK killing activity. However, challenges remain. Therefore, new
treatments are needed to extend survival and increase durability of remission in relapsed/refractory patients
and those ineligible for front-line therapy.
 My laboratory developed NK3.3, the only normal human NK cell line. It was cloned from peripheral blood
NK cells and kills an array of tumor cells. As NK3.3 cells grow in culture, they release small membrane-bound
extracellular vesicles (EVs). We demonstrated that purified NK3.3 EVs kill MM cell lines and primary patient
samples, without harming normal cells. NK3.3 EVs also kill drug-resistant and cancer stem cells (CSC).
 There are many advantages to using NK3.3 EVs for cancer treatment. They can be generated in large
quantities, are stable, and can be frozen and thawed without loss of function. EVs are resistant to the hypoxic
tumor microenvironment and unlike cellular therapy, do not induce a detrimental cytokine storm. NK3.3-derived
EVs may provide the advantages of NK cell therapy without the challenges of expanding cells and side effects.
 The goal of these studies is to establish the feasibility of using NK3.3-derived EVs for MM treatment. We
developed a murine xenograft model of minimal residual disease in MM, which approximates a human clinical
condition. After intravenous injection of RPM1-8226 MM cells into immunodeficient mice, tumor cells
disseminate, infiltrate bones, and induce osteolytic lesions, characteristics of MM. We will test the ability of
NK3.3 EVs to prevent MM recurrence after chemotherapy treatment.
 Aim 1: Characterize NK3.3 EVs and establish best practices for production. We will develop optimal
NK3.3 culture conditions for EV production. Proteomic and lipidomic analysis will be performed on EV
preparations. NK3.3 EVs will be evaluated for killing MM cell lines and patient samples and for lack of toxicity
against healthy bone marrow, peripheral blood lymphocytes and fibroblasts.
 Aim 2: Identify the mechanism(s) of NK EV-mediated killing. NK EVs induce caspase-mediated
apoptosis. However, like NK cells, NK EVs likely kill via multiple mechanisms. We will evaluate caspase-
dependent and independent killing pathways in EV-treated tumor cells. We will inhibit killing pathways by gene
knockdown and chemical treatment. MM cell lines and primary tumor cells will be used to determine whether
drug-resistant and CSC-like MM cells are sensitive to killing by NK3.3 EVs.
 Aim 3: Test the in vivo efficacy of NK3.3 EVs in preventing/delaying tumor recurrence in a murine
model of minimal residual disease in MM. Different concentrations of NK EVs will be administered
intravenously. Tumor dissemination will be monitored by bioluminescence imaging; bone lesions by X-ray and
CT scanning. Toxicity will be assessed by analysis of body and organ weights and blood chemistry. Normal
and tumor-bearing mice will be infused with labeled NK EVs to monitor biodistribution and half-life. These
studies are the first step towards developing NK3.3 EVs as a treatment for MM patients who desperately need
new options to improve their quality of life and prolong their survival."
10909807,"The goal of this project is to conduct a Phase I clinical trial to determine the recommended Phase II dose
(RP2D) of bladder cancer-targeting micelles loaded with a chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX). With a VA
Career Development Award-2 and VA Merit grant (PI: Pan), we developed a bladder cancer-specific targeting
ligand named PLZ4, and a PLZ4-coated PTX-loaded nanoscale micelle (PPM) platform that can specifically
deliver the drug load into bladder cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This proposed clinical trial is to conduct
a first-in-human trial to use PPM for the treatment of non-myoinvasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Bladder cancer
is one of the ten most common cancers in the United States. NMIBC accounts for around 75% of bladder
cancer cases at diagnosis. The current first-line treatment approach of transurethral resection followed by
intravesical instillation of therapeutic agents, usually Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is associated with a
recurrence rate of around 70% at two years. Pembrolizumab and valrubicin are the only second-line drug
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a response rate of 40% and 20-40%, respectively.
Considering that bladder cancer is among the top ten most common cancers and over 70% of bladder cancers
are diagnosed as NMIBC, there are huge unmet medical needs for developing more effective therapies. This
primary objective of the proposed Phase I trial is to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of PPM.
The secondary objectives are to assess the toxicity, obtain preliminary efficacy information of PPM, and
determine systemic absorption after intravesical instillation of PPM. Up to 25 patients with recurrent or refractory
NMIBC after a standard first-line intravesical therapy pembrolizumab treatment will be recruited. PPM will be
given as intravesical instillation once weekly for six weeks. The toxicity will be assessed by the NCI Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The efficacy will be determined by urine cytology
and cystoscopy two weeks after finishing treatment. Molecular correlative studies will be performed."
10738773,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among Veterans. Nationally, its mortality rate is 76% that of breast
cancer; one in 41 men will die of it. National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for precision prostate
cancer care have incorporated tumor sequencing for men with advanced-stage prostate cancer, and germline
sequencing of men with a family history of prostate cancer. Its purpose is to discern inherited as well as
somatic drivers to guide precision therapy, though also potentially uncovering familial cancer risks. But the
knowledge base to guide prognostic and therapeutic decision-making in prostate cancer remains very limiting.
Even though prostate cancer has the greatest heritable risk of all common cancers, the causes of nearly 90%
of its inherited forms remain unknown. In contrast to breast and other common cancers, the broad diversity of
hereditary prostate cancer's causes has impeded traditional pedigree-based investigation by linkage. The goal
of this study is to further elucidate diverse causes of hereditary prostate cancer using a novel, alternative
familial case-control study design. We compare independent cases, each with a strong family history of
prostate cancer, to screened controls, each with a negative family history of prostate cancer. Our Aims
capitalize upon dense genetic data to identify cases that share a given disease gene inherited from a common
distant ancestor, even though genealogical relationships among them are not known. We identify disease
genes by discerning excess sharing of ancestral genomic segments among cases, reconstructing haplotypes
harboring mutations with strong risk of prostate cancer, and discerning correlated regional genetic variants and
underlying candidate causal mutations. We introduce a novel algorithm to identify sentinel variants best
detecting the independent risk signals, and forming a clinically predictive model. We further delineate which
genetic loci are responsible for the early age of diagnosis characterizing familial disease, some also impacting
aggressiveness. We employ replication across independent familial case-control study populations to discern
true from false positive observations, and we evaluate additional existing case-control and biobank data sets to
generalize pertinent observations. This study will improve the knowledge base for precision oncology and
familial cancer care of Veterans."
10765630,"Project Summary
 A comprehensive 3D molecular map of the human body would provide valuable information that is
critical for studying human-related processes and biological systems such as development, aging, and
disease. Towards this goal of constructing such a map, multidisciplinary consortia such as the Human Cell
Atlas (HCA) and the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) have developed technologies for profiling
the transcriptome and proteome in single cells. Out of these technologies, methods for single-cell spatial
proteomics have only very recently been developed; for example, recent advances in multiplexed imaging have
enabled the profiling of tens to hundreds of proteins per cell. While the generation of single-cell spatial
proteomics data promise to revolutionize our ability to study cell-cell interactions, it also raises several
computational and modeling challenges. Cell segmentation remains a long-standing problem that usually
requires tailored solutions for each bioimaging experiment. Even after cells are segmented, using expression
values to infer cell type and organization is challenging. There are currently no standardized methods
developed that jointly incorporate spatial and molecular information to analyze the complex biological
interactions from rich spatial proteomics datasets.
 This project proposes to develop computational methods to provide a comprehensive solution for the
use of spatial proteomics data for building 3D molecular maps of the human body. We hypothesize that jointly
profiling spatial and molecular relationships from spatial proteomics datasets captures biological patterns that
would otherwise be missed. In Aim 1, a method will be developed for RAnking Markers for CEll Segmentation
(RAMCES) in order to choose the optimal protein markers to use for cell segmentation. In Aim 2, a unified
learning framework that incorporates both protein expression and cell neighborhood information will be
constructed in order to assign cells to phenotypes and reveal spatial patterns. In Aim 3, methods will be
developed to infer cell-cell and protein-protein interactions in spatial proteomics data. The methods developed
in this project will be integrated into the HuBMAP processing pipeline to analyze spatial proteomics datasets.
We will also apply and validate these methods using data from pancreatic lymph nodes that profile individuals
with and without Type 1 diabetes to analyze changes associated with the disease at an unprecedented scale.
Together, completing the proposed aims will enable the HuBMAP project to uncover new biological interactions
in cells and tissues and expand our understanding of molecular interactions at a single-cell level.
 This proposal outlines a training plan that comprises of mentored research training, coursework, and
professional development. The knowledge and skillset developed during the training period will be necessary
for the applicant's long-term goal of becoming a successful independent scientist working at the interface of
machine learning, computer science, and biology."
10731382,"Approximately 30 million adults have diabetes (DM) in the United States and DM confers a risk for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether CVD is prevented by antidiabetic therapies which target glycemic
control remains relatively unknown. Between 2013-2017 there were multiple pivotal trials of newer agent called
sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA)
vs placebo. These newer agents demonstrated reduction in CVD and kidney outcomes. These new
medications demonstrated lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) versus placebo with a
pronounced effect among those with pre-existing CVD, and less data for those without CVD. But the trials also
demonstrated increased risks of adverse events including a two-fold risk of amputations. There were both trial
and post-marketing reports of fractures with SGLT2 because of impaired bone metabolite excretion.
These medications are high cost; $300-$500 per month of treatment under VHA contracting. Use of these high
cost medications if they prevented CVD would provide a return on investment. However, their efficacy is
demonstrated vs placebo; their effectiveness relative to other commonly used medications remains unknown
because data from real world cohorts is methodologically limited. Methodologically strong comparative
effectiveness observational studies are necessary to determine the relative benefits We propose to conduct a
National longitudinal study using administrative, clinical and laboratory data to quantify the relative risks/
benefits of DM agents among Veterans in two cohorts with and without CVD.
This proposal will answer the question: Among patients with DM, what are the absolute risks of adverse
events and potential cardiovascular and renal benefits for those who add on SGLT2 or GLP1RA
compared to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4)? We will expand the cohort through FY2020 of
Veterans with diabetes: utilizing national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data (corporate data
warehouse-vital signs; pharmacy, medical datasets, Medicare/ Medicaid data and vital status files), national
death index and additional data on ankle brachial index and echocardiograms. Eligible veterans will be new
users of SGLT2, GLP1RA or DPP4 aged >18 years who utilize VHA from 10/1/2000 through 09/30/2020. The
current data (through FY 2016) has 35,799 SGLT2 new users; 68,876 new users of GLP1RA; and 203,030
new users of DPP4 (reference). We propose to evaluate the risks and benefits in 2 cohorts, those with and
without CVD. The proposed study follows this cohort from new drug initiation until an outcome or censoring
event (leave VHA, change therapy or death). The comparisons of interest will be: SGLT2 or GLP1RA vs.
DPP4. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the risk of MACE (4 component- AMI/ Stroke/ CV death/ Heart failure)
in patients treated with SGLT2 or GLP1RA is lower than the risk in patients treated with DPP4. Aim 2 will test
the hypothesis that CKD progression and all-cause mortality is lower in patients treated with SGLT2 or
GLP1RA vs. DPP4. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that amputation and peripheral artery disease (PAD)
revascularization is higher for patients treated with SGLT2 vs. DPP4. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that risk of
fracture is higher for patients treated with SGLT2 vs. DPP4. Propensity score weighting will be used to achieve
similar groups. We will compare event rates accounting for baseline and time-varying covariates with marginal
structural Cox proportional hazards models (MSM) with “stabilized” inverse probability treatment weights
(IPTW). The execution of the proposed research will provide actionable evidence for patients with DM, would
impact VHA policy and results would add to the oversight and costs of purchased community care for
DM. Our team has been extremely productive over the last 7 years and is poised to conduct a rigorous and
necessary evaluation of the effectiveness of newer DM regimens. Our publication record attests to our ability to
use VHA data for accurate and impactful measurememnt of the safety and effectiveness of DM medications."
10825532,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to profile all clinically relevant genetic variants
simultaneously. However, clinical variant discovery pipelines have focused largely on coding single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), and to a lesser extent on regulatory SNVs and small indels, ignoring more complex classes of
pathogenic variants such as repeats or structural rearrangements.
 Repeats can take many forms, but we consider three classes of repeats: short tandem repeats (STRs),
variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), and low-copy repeats or segmental duplications, together
accounting for more than 8% of the human genome. These variant classes have been implicated in a number
of Mendelian diseases. More than 30 disorders, primarily neurodegenerative, are caused by STR expansions,
including Huntington’s Disease, Fragile X Syndrome, ALS/FTD, and hereditary ataxias. Similarly, VNTRs have
been implicated in a range of psychiatric and other traits including medullary cystic kidney disease and type 1
diabetes. In many cases, the disease progression is correlated with germline repeat counts, but sequence
variation within individual repeat units, and somatic instability of repeat length, has also been shown to be
pathogenic in some cases. Finally, mutations in more than 100 duplicated genes have been implicated in rare
Mendelian disorders and cancer, including PMS2 in Lynch Syndrome and STRC in hearing loss. Taken
together, diseases associated with these repeat classes affect millions of individuals worldwide.
 Despite their relevance to disease, these repeat types are typically absent from sequence analysis
pipelines due to the bioinformatics challenges they present. Over the last several years, we and others have
made significant progress in developing methods to analyze clinically relevant repeats from short reads.
However, important challenges remain, including the ability to genotype long, complex, imperfect, or GC rich
repeats, to infer clinically relevant somatic variation, and the computational burden of existing methods.
Further, existing frameworks for predicting the pathogenicity of individual SNVs or indels are not applicable to
most repeats, and thus there is a need for prioritization methods to predict the impact of new repeat variants.
 The goal of this project is to make repeat analysis a standard component of existing Mendelian
variant calling pipelines. To this end, we will develop novel methods for profiling repeat variants from long
reads (Aim 1), extend our existing methods for short reads to consider more complex variant types (Aim 2),
and establish a framework for prioritization of pathogenic repeat mutations (Aim 3)."

The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) seeks competitive renewal of its RCMI - Center for Health
Disparities Research (RCHDR) to continue enhancing NCCU's research ecosystem to develop investigators
who are conducting impactful and cutting-edge research to address health disparities (HD). The Center is an
interdisciplinary effort at NCCU housed at the Julius L. Chambers Biomedical/Biotechnology Research Institute
(BBRI), an institute opened in 1999 to pursue research disproportionately afflicting minority populations in NC
and to diversify the research workforce. In this renewal application, a concerted effort was made to establish an
inclusive, diverse, and representative leadership team for the RCHDR through a group of senior- and mid-level
experienced individuals. The Center will be comprised of four Cores: Administrative Core (AC); Research
Capacity Core (RCC) (arranged into 5 sub-cores); Investigator Development Core (IDC) and Community
Engagement Core (CEC) supporting one basic and one behavioral full biomedical research project plus pilot
studies. The Center will continue to leverage resources and partnerships at neighboring research organizations
in the Research Triangle Park, NC area, with community based organizations (CBOs) in rural and urban NC as
well as the nationwide RCMI network via the RCMI coordinating center to advance the following three specific
aims: (1) Enhance basic biomedical and behavioral HD research at NCCU by conducting two innovative
research projects and instituting a restructured RCC with innovative capabilities to support basic and behavioral
biomedical and population health projects, while enriching our research ecosystem; (2) Prepare and enable all
investigators (including postdoctoral, early stage, research track, tenure-track and tenured) to become
successful extramurally funded HD researchers through coordinated activities of the AC and IDC; and (3)
Strengthen and grow the CEC by fostering existing and new sustainable relationships with CBOs and local health
departments to further extend the community-based network for continued engagement with stakeholders and
dissemination and implementation of HD research findings. In this competitive renewal, we will continue our
focus on basic biomedical and behavioral sciences. Continued support of our RCMI – Center, through
leveraging previous work and the commitment of NCCU to biomedical research, will have profound impact on
the region, while greatly enhancing the research capacity at this HBCU and driving it towards achieving its
mission of addressing health disparities."
10760326,"Injectable Hydrogel Electrodes to Prevent Ventricular Arrhythmias
In the United States, sudden cardiac death accounts for 350,000 deaths per year with the leading cause being
lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The underlying electrophysiologic derangement mechanistically responsible for
ventricular arrhythmias is delayed conduction velocity in scarred or otherwise diseased myocardium. Access to
the smaller vessels and tributaries that cross over scarred region of the heart could provide improved pacing;
however, there are no pacing leads small enough to navigate these smaller tributaries. In this research, we
propose a novel method to treat and manage ventriculararrhythmias – developmentof a newconductive material
that can fill both large and small coronary vessels and convert these tributaries into flexible electrodes to restore
capture across regions of scarring. Our collaborative team that combines clinical expertise (Razavi) and
biomaterial science (Cosgriff-Hernandez) has demonstrated early feasibility of pacing myocardium with an in situ
curing hydrogel in a pig model. We plan to build on this initial proof of concept to develop a combined material
and delivery system that can interface with existing pacemaker technology to greatly expand their capability to
treat ventricular arrhythmias. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have utilized a battery of in vitro
and in vivo tests to establish the safety and efficacy of this new injectable hydrogel electrode. Confirmation of
increased activation area as compared to standard-of-care single point pacing will validate the efficacy of this
innovative approach to eliminate the conduction delay in scarred myocardium that results in lethal ventricular
arrhythmias. We will use a post-myocardial infarct model to demonstrate that hydrogel electrode pacing reduces
the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and defibrillation shocks. Painless stimulation of wide areas of the heart
using planar wavefront propagation from these hydrogel electrodes provides a new cardiac resynchronization
therapy that will alter the landscape of cardiac rhythm management."
10794337,"Summary
 Our research seeks to uncover the molecular mechanisms of activation and modulation of two
dimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), human GABAB receptor and human calcium-sensing
(CaS) receptor. The GABAB receptor is ubiquitous in the central nervous system, responsible for
mediating slow and prolonged synaptic inhibition. Defects in GABAB receptor have been implicated in
brain and behavioral disorders, including spasticity, epilepsy, addiction, and anxiety. CaS receptor
maintains a stable Ca2+ level in the blood. Abnormal activities of the CaS receptor are associated with a
vareity of Ca2+ homeostatic disorders including potentially life threatening hypercalcemic conditions.
Both receptors function as obligatory dimers and contain large extracellular domains that are
responsible for orthosteric ligand binding. Fundamental questions remain regarding how an
extracellular stimulus propagates a signal across the membrane through such a dimeric GPCR system.
Building on our structural models for the extracellular domains of each receptor, we plan to determine
full-length structures of these GPCRs, including their transmembrane domains, in multiple functional
states. For each receptor, we aim to address three main questions: (1) how the dimeric interactions
control receptor activation, (2) what the mode of coupling between each receptor and its cognitive G
protein is, and (3) how allosteric modulators and auxiliary proteins regulate receptor function. We will
combine structural and functional approaches to understand the molecular basis of ligand-induced
activation in each receptor system. Our findings will ultimately lead to the development of novel
therapeutics for treating diseases associated with the GABAB and CaS receptors."
10756519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Hippo pathway is a key regulator of development, regeneration, tissue homeostasis and organ size,
whose dysregulations have been frequently observed in human diseases like cancer. In mammals, the Hippo
pathway is composed of a core kinase cascade that comprises two Ser/Thr kinases MST and LATS as well as
their adaptor proteins SAV1 and MOB1, respectively, downstream effector protein YAP, and nuclear
transcription factor TEAD. Upon Hippo pathway activation, MST phosphorylates and activates LATS, which in
turn phosphorylates YAP, resulting in its cytoplasmic retention and degradation. Un-phosphorylated YAP is
translocated into the nucleus, where it binds TEAD to drive the transcription of genes involved in various
growth-related events. Recent studies in both Drosophila and mammals have further revealed MAP4K-family
kinases (MAP4Ks) and PP2A phosphatase complex STRIPAK as additional components of the Hippo
pathway, where MAP4Ks act in parallel to MST to phosphorylate and activate LATS, while STRIPAK inhibits
MST and MAP4Ks to control the Hippo core kinase cascade. Multiple growth-related signaling events, such as
growth factors, glucose/energy homeostasis, cell-cell contact, mechanical cues and a series of stress signals,
have been uncovered to regulate the Hippo pathway and its downstream YAP-dependent transcriptional
program. However, precisely how these upstream signaling stimuli feed into the Hippo pathway core
components has not been fully understood. In the past grant period, we shed light on this long-standing
question by characterizing phosphatidic acid and its-associated lipid metabolic pathway in transducing the
Hippo pathway upstream signaling events to the Hippo pathway kinase LATS. In the current grant period, we
propose to re-examine the Hippo pathway in energy stress response that was discovered by us a few years
ago. Specifically, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the energy stress-induced Hippo
pathway activation by characterizing the role of the AMPK-STRIPAK-MAP4Ks axis in this process (Aim 1). In
addition, we will investigate a YAP-independent function of the Hippo pathway in promoting cell survival
against energy stress (Aim 2). Collectively, completion of this project will reveal mechanistically how energy
stress activates the Hippo pathway and provide functional insights into the Hippo pathway in growth control
and cancer development."
10755341,"SUMMARY
The delayed healing observed in chronic wounds is exacerbated by persistent microbial infections and non-
resolving inflammation. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has limited the use of these
agents for treating infected wounds. Adding to the complexity of chronic wound treatment, infection is usually
not the sole cause of wound chronicity. Underlying diseases such as diabetes leave individuals prone to infection
by affecting the host immune responses, including inflammatory cell migration, cell signaling, and effector
function. An ideal wound healing therapeutic must thus address the impairment of the host immune response while also
possessing antibacterial activity. Due to the high prevalence of chronic wound-related amputations and mortality, the need
for such a multi-action therapeutic is urgent. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous signaling molecule that represents
an attractive, alternative therapeutic for treating chronic wounds due to its innate antibacterial and
immunomodulatory function in human physiology. We have pioneered the development of macromolecular
NO donor systems that store and spontaneously release NO in dissolved form (i.e., not as a gas) at
therapeutically relevant levels. We now aim to develop NO-releasing glycosaminoglycan biopolymers (GAGs)
as wound healing therapeutics. GAGs are naturally occurring biopolymers that are immunomodulatory and
known to be involved in wound healing physiology. We hypothesize that combining the multi-faceted roles of
GAGs and NO will allow for a therapeutic that effectively: 1) eradicates wound pathogens; 2) modulates
inflammation; and, 3) promotes re-epithelialization to facilitate timely wound closure.
The objective of this project is to define the roles of GAG molecular weight, sulfation patterns and NO-release
properties as they related to antibacterial and pro-wound healing activities. In developing a new class of wound-
healing therapeutics, we will characterize cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration as a function of NO
payloads and GAG structure using cell culture assays and a three-dimensional human skin tissue model. We
will evaluate the effect of NO-releasing GAGs on innate immune cell plasticity using primary human cell
systems. We will then determine the therapeutic efficacy of the most promising NO-releasing GAG derivatives
on antibacterial action, inflammation, and wound closure as a function of infection and diabetes. An iterative
approach will be taken to determine the optimal dose, time, and frequency of therapeutic intervention. A
systems biology approach will be used to elucidate mechanisms of efficacy and failure, which will inform clinical
translation of these therapeutic approaches. This new research program will allow us to build upon our previous
successes in developing NO-releasing macromolecular scaffolds, but now with a focus on wound healing. Our
goal is to develop a therapeutic that treats infection and promotes wound healing in populations afflicted by chronic wounds."
10907430,"ABSTRACT
Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a global public health problem affecting 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 12 boys before age
18. Parents are uniquely positioned to protect children from CSA, yet parents have largely been ignored in
CSA primary prevention efforts and the few that do exist have not demonstrated a significant effect on
protective behaviors. Parent education (PE) programs provide parents with foundational skills related to child
development, parent-child communication, and safety. These foundational skills can be logically extended into
didactics relevant to CSA prevention: healthy sexual development, strategies for parents to communicate with
their children and others about sexual topics and sexual behaviors, and creating physical and online
environments safe from potential exploitation and recognizing grooming behaviors. Our team developed Smart
Parents – Safe and Healthy Kids (Smart Parents) as a single session, skills-based, parent-focused CSA
prevention module that adds these key CSA-specific prevention concepts to PE program curricula. Leveraging
the PE foundational skills, Smart Parents provides parents with CSA-prevention knowledge to increase their
CSA-related attitudes and perceived norms as well as the opportunity to practice protective behavioral skills. A
recent cluster randomized clinical trial demonstrated preliminary to be effective in raising parents' awareness
and increasing their intention to use of CSA protective behaviors when added to Parents as Teachers (PAT),
an evidence-based PE program supported by most state child welfare systems. The proposed study seeks to
expand the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of Smart Parents and to explore the implementation
factors that might promote or hinder adoption, fidelity, and scalability, the proposed study uses a type 2 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design. We will conduct a stepped wedge-cluster randomized trial (N = 400) To
determine effectiveness (Aim1) of Smart Parents when added to PAT (PAT+Smart Parents) on CSA-related
awareness and intention to use CSA protective behaviors compared to parents receiving PAT treatment as
usual (PAT-TAU. We will follow-up participating parents in both conditions at 12- and 24-months to determine
retention of awareness (i.e., knowledge and attitudes) and actual use of protective behaviors (Aim 2). To
describe factors that hold promise for future dissemination and implementation efforts (Aim 3), we will: assess
parent, provider, and organizational-level moderators of Smart Parents effectiveness; conduct a cost analysis;
and conduct structured interviews with Smart Parents providers (N = 100) and focus groups with key PE
stakeholders (N = 25) to identify factors that may impact future dissemination and implementation. By
leveraging the foundational skills taught in existing PE used by state-supported family service providers across
the US—and supported through federal policy such as the Family First Prevention Services Act—the
integration of Smart Parents into PE programs is not only efficient and cost-effective, but constitutes a
sustainable model of system-wide, real-world, community-based implementation of primary CSA prevention."
10754957,"Despite evidence-based NIH guidelines for asthma, overall morbidity among children has not significantly
decreased. In the US, asthma accounts for >150,000 hospitalizations, >600,000 emergency department visits,
and nearly 14 million missed school days annually. Striking socioeconomic and racial inequities persist with
under-resourced children incurring a disproportionate share of asthma morbidity. Our long-term goal is to
improve health outcomes and reduce disparities in asthma morbidity for all children. Our team will address
critical barriers to achieving broad-scale improvements in outcomes for all children hospitalized with asthma in
the US, in any setting. This proposal’s overall objective is to improve asthma outcomes by conducting a
patient-centered, multicomponent intervention focusing on under-resourced children with asthma at both
children’s (ChH) and community hospitals (CH). Intervention components are navigation support, medications
in-hand at discharge, primary care provider communication, school-based therapy, and home assessment.
Leveraging feedback from stakeholders and building on the telehealth infrastructure, we will utilize a pragmatic
effectiveness-implementation trial design to test the overall hypothesis that a refined version of the Hospital-to-
Home (H2H) intervention will reduce asthma readmissions over a 12-month follow-up period. The hypothesis
will be tested in the following aims. (1): Engage key stakeholders to identify barriers and facilitators for
implementation of the components of H2H at children’s (ChH) and community hospitals (CHs). We will conduct
qualitative interviews to identify barriers and facilitators and refine each component for optimal implementation.
(2): Evaluate health outcomes of the H2H intervention compared to usual care control group for children
hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation at ChH and CH sites. We propose a multi-center, randomized trial
enrolling 340 caregiver-child (aged 4-12yrs) dyads during hospitalization to a multi-component intervention. (3):
Evaluate implementation of each component of the H2H intervention and assess impact of implementation on
health outcomes. We will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity using mixed-methods to assess
variation in implementation of each component across sites and their impact on health outcomes. By focusing
on broader implementation at both ChHs and CHs, this innovative proposal has significant implications for
improving asthma management and reducing health disparities incurred by under-resourced school-aged
children. This proposal is aligned with NIH’s mission to address health disparities and will provide crucial
insights in intervention implementation at all types of hospital settings that care for children. Because the
hospitalization for children with asthma serves a high-risk population who may otherwise be difficult to reach,
identifying the most clinically effective method by which to deliver a preventative health service is urgently
needed. This work has the potential to shift current hospitalization clinical practice paradigms from only acute
encounters for asthma exacerbations to the broader management of public health prevention."
10786098,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Consistent with the research priorities of the National Institute on Aging, this R01 application will investigate the
optimal intervention sequence to achieve weight loss in older adults with obesity and ≥ 2 Medicare-defined
multiple chronic conditions (MCC). The growing prevalence of obesity in older adults, particularly in those with
common chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or arthritis, increases the risk of functional decline,
nursing home placement, and early mortality. Weight loss interventions can mitigate such adverse outcomes;
however, differential response to treatment is often observed due to a patient’s clinical heterogeneity. Clinicians
lack guidance on the most effective lifestyle-based intervention, and which intervention to try if the first one fails.
An innovative Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART) design will be conducted to identify
optimal intervention approaches for weight loss in older adults with MCC, tailoring strategies for non-responders
to weight loss. During the 52-week, two-stage trial, 180 older adults with obesity and MCC will be enrolled to
compare two weight loss interventions: a prescriptively focused, medically tailored, weight loss intervention
(prescriptive), and a behaviorally focused, health coaching intervention (behavioral). Consistent with a SMART
design, at 8-weeks, early non-responders (weight loss of <2.5%) will be randomized to: (a) more sessions of the
original assignment; (b) a combination of prescriptive and behavioral interventions; or (c) a switch to a
prescriptive, medically tailored strategy (initial, first-line behavioral arm participants) or to a behaviorally focused
health coach-delivered strategy (initial prescriptive arm participants). The SMART will enable the identification
of the treatment combinations that maximize weight loss at 52-weeks. To this end, the proposal aims to: 1) test
the superiority of an initial (first-line) prescriptive or behavioral intervention using an adaptive strategy for early
non-responders; 2) assess the patterns of initial weight loss and compare strategies for non-responders; and 3)
examine the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective for maintaining weight loss of the proposed treatment
sequences at 78-weeks (26-weeks post-intervention completion). The primary outcome is percent weight loss at
52-weeks; secondary outcomes include global health and physical function, anthropometry, behavioral treatment
targets and risk factors, and clinical indices. Based on preliminary data, it is hypothesized that older adults with
obesity and MCC will achieve greater weight loss with a prescriptive, medically tailored intervention, and the
estimated adaptive intervention strategy tailored to a patient’s characteristics will lead to better outcomes than a
fixed intervention. If the trial is successful, the adaptive strategy will be compared to a fixed prescriptive or
behavioral strategy in a future comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed approach should benefit patients
facing competing and complex medical issues who are underrepresented in clinical trials. This study aligns with
the NIH Strategic Plans for Obesity, Nutrition Research, and Precision Health, and is responsive to the Institute
of Medicine’s call for telehealth research that may influence policy by advancing health delivery science."
10778647,"RNA abasic sites are recently identified modifications in RNA that are generated by
methylpurine glycosylase to regulate gene expression. They are abundant in RNA and they
stabilize RNA yet we do not know much about how they form, their precursors, and their
functions.
DNA abasic sites were identified in the 1960s and those discoveries led to the elucidation of the
base excision repair pathway in DNA damage. But RNA abasic sites were largely unknown,
except those generated by the plant poison, ricin, in ribosomal RNA. While studying proteins
that bind to the nucleic acid structure, R-loop, we identified RNA modification enzymes and
methylpurine glycosylase as well as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease I that were known to
process DNA abasic sites.
We have now shown that methylpurine glycosylase cleaves the glycosidic bond in RNA to form
abasic sites and these reactions occur on RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids of R-loops. By mass
spectrometry, we found that RNA abasic sites are rather abundant, there are tens to hundreds
of thousands of them in each cell. We also found in an enhancer RNA of APOE, N6-
methyladenosines are cleaved by methylpurine glycosylase to form RNA abasic sites on R-
loops. The abasic sites then stabilize R-loops and pause RNA Polymerase II transcription. We
show that this mechanism keeps the noncoding RNA poised to activate APOE expression in
response to cellular demands.
Given that we have early evidence for the role of RNA abasic sites in the regulation of
noncoding RNA, it is necessary to better understand them. We propose to 1) examine the
genome-wide effect of nucleic-acid-mediated pausing on noncoding RNA, 2) identify other
glycosylases that form RNA abasic sites, and 3) determine what other modified RNA bases are
precursors of RNA abasic sites. Together, these results will characterize RNA abasic sites by
finding how they form and what they do."
10829399,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Functional MRI (fMRI) is today the predominant tool for noninvasive imaging of brain function, which has
revolutionized our understanding of the human brain. To date, echo-planar imaging (EPI) has been the standard
fMRI acquisition method, but suffers from intrinsic limitations such as static and dynamic distortion,
image/contrast blurring, signal voids, suboptimal CNR and physiological noises. These limitations compromise
the sensitivity and reliability of task and resting-state fMRI, and hinder the effective spatial resolution and
achievable functional specificity for state-of-the-art high-resolution laminar or columnar fMRI studies, especially
given that these problems become more severe at higher resolutions and field strengths.
Echo-planar time-resolved imaging (EPTI) has recently been introduced to address these limitations.
Conventional image formation generates a single echo image from k-space samples evolving across time with
accumulated imperfections. EPTI recognizes the strong spatiotemporal correlation of the data during the image
encoding process, and exploits it to replace conventional image formation and resolve multi-echo images from
the fully-recovered spatiotemporal data, making the acquisition immune to these imperfections. This turns a
deficit – the evolution of the MR signal with time – into an asset. It achieves high SNR/CNR efficiency using
continuous readout with minimal deadtime, while providing images completely free from both static and dynamic
distortions caused by field inhomogeneity and its variations due to subject motion. The multi-echo images
sampled at a wide range of TEs (e.g., ~4–70 ms) not only allow for optimal CNR across the whole brain and
mitigated signal dropout at challenging short T2* regions, but also enable effective removal of unwanted
physiological noise. Moreover, they provide pure contrast at the exact TEs with minimal contaminations that can
be used to improve the specificity for high-resolution laminar or columnar fMRI studies. These improvements
provided by EPTI have been demonstrated at both 3T and 7T in a variety of applications.
The goal of this project is therefore to broadly disseminate EPTI as the next-generation fMRI acquisition tool.
Despite its demonstrated high value, EPTI has only been used in a small number of sites due to the lack of
available pulse sequence and image reconstruction software and the challenge of cross-vendor implementation.
In this project, we will overcome these barriers by assembling and disseminating the whole EPTI acquisition,
reconstruction and pre-processing package developed in different vendor platforms (Siemens and GE) and in
open-source and cross-vendor frameworks accessible to multiple other vendors. The sequence will be refined
by incorporating multiple functionalities, and integrated with the optimized reconstruction and pre-processing in
a user-friendly workflow. We will also leverage the existing resources and mechanisms at Martinos Center for
technology dissemination and quality assurance, which have been refined over the years through large-scale
studies (e.g., HCP, ABCD), to maximize the impact of this technology and ensure its sustainability."
10811757,"Project Summary and Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent cancer in American men.
Luminal histology is a hallmark of PCa. Hormone therapy effectively targets luminal cells, but resistance
inevitably occurs. The ERG oncoprotein is overexpressed in half of PCa cases. Prostatic ERG expression in
mice recapitulates invasion with a luminal program seen in human PCa, thus presenting a clinically relevant
model to study PCa. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ERG drives a luminal fate and invasive
PCa remain unclear, insights from which may reveal new treatment paradigms. Project objective: To
elucidate the mechanisms and vulnerabilities of ERG-driven luminal fate and PCa invasion. Preliminary data:
1) pseudo-basal cells (those with a mixture basal/luminal marker profile) rather than luminal cells are the most
proliferative, and invasion-associated population in PCa; 2) a genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals that ERG
stimulates luminal fate by alleviating aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling, which provides a druggable
vulnerability. Central hypothesis: ERG stimulates a progenitor state, characterized as pseudo-basal cells,
that sustains invasion and luminal output of PCa. The proposed project leverages innovative mouse and
organoid models, genome-wide screen data, and patient samples to test this hypothesis. Specific Aims: 1)
determine the luminal progenitor and oncogenic potential of pseudo-basal cells in ERG-driven PCa; 2) define
how AHR and other screen candidates modulate lineage output as a mechanism and vulnerability of ERG
function; 3) characterize the pseudo-basal state in human PCa. Impact: Success of this work will 1) advance
mechanistic understanding, 2) identify novel vulnerabilities of ERG-driven PCa, the most frequent PCa
subtype, and 3) provide tools and approaches with wide applicability to studying lineage fate choices in cancer.
This work will be performed under the collaborative and resourceful research environment at MSKCC. I have
recently developed CRISPR editing tools for rapid PCa modeling (Proc Natl Acad Sci), which will be critical to
advance the proposed work. My long-term career goal is to establish an independent research team that
focuses on mechanistic understanding of PCa to develop novel therapeutic strategies. I have developed a
detailed career plan to obtain skills in leadership, management, mentoring, grant writing, and scientific
communications. I will work under the mentorship of Dr. Charles Sawyers, a leader in PCa research with a
stellar track record of trainees that went on to faculty positions. In addition, I have assembled an Advisory
Committee that will collaborate with me and offer training on science and career development, including Drs.
Michael Shen (prostate lineage specification), Yu Chen (ERG biology), Gary Perdew (AHR biology), Anuradha
Gopalan (patient sample assessment), and Christina Leslie (computational biology). My research and career
development plan, together with my mentor, advisors and the exceptional academic environment at MSKCC will
provide a solid foundation for my independence in translational prostate cancer research."

Sepsis is prevalent, costly, and deadly. In the U.S, sepsis accounts for 4% of hospitalizations, 13% of in-hospital
healthcare expenditures, and 35% of in-hospital deaths. Although common, sepsis is often difficult to diagnose
and treat effectively, since it is a syndrome defined generically by organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated
immune response to infection. This broad definition leads to heterogeneity of disease and misdiagnosis. Clinical
trials thus enroll ill-characterized populations of sepsis patients with variable underlying immune responses to
infection, diluting the effects of novel and otherwise promising therapies that might benefit a defined subset of
patients. Precision immune cell-specific characterization of the dysregulated host immune response in sepsis is
clearly needed. Our group was the first to elucidate an immunosuppressive monocyte substate (MS1) expanded
in patients with urosepsis (Reyes et al. Nat Med 2020) using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which
resolves cellular heterogeneity, revealing rich signatures of immune cell-specific gene expression not evident
from standard immune profiling techniques. Clinical investigation in sepsis would greatly benefit from the scalable
deployment of scRNA-seq across multicenter studies and clinical trials to enable robust characterization of the
host immune response in sepsis, and to explain the effect of disease heterogeneity on clinical course, outcomes,
and treatment effects. Yet in order to facilitate subsequent scRNA-seq, immune cells must be isolated from whole
blood samples, which currently involves complex real-time processing of fresh blood at clinical sites, a process
neither practical nor reproducible enough to allow deployment across multiple clinical centers.
To address this critical need, we piloted a simple method of onsite whole blood cryopreservation that uses only
2 mL of blood and is easily deployable at clinical sites, followed by storage for scRNA-seq at a centralized center
of expertise. In the R21 phase, we will optimize and validate our method of whole blood cryopreservation on
enrolled subjects at 2 local clinical sites versus gold standard methods for immune cell isolation. We will compare
scRNA-seq technical quality metrics and biologically-relevant measures including the MS1 monocyte subtype
and other immune cell states. Importantly, we will test the viability and function of cryopreserved cells in
mechanistic studies. In the R33 phase, we will scale our whole blood cryopreservation method to 5 enrolling
clinical sites around the U.S. to demonstrate feasibility of a multicenter collection with centralized scRNA-seq
and analysis. In this expanded sepsis cohort, we will perform deep immune profiling and derive scRNA-seq-
based endotypes to characterize underlying heterogeneity of host immune responses. We will compare these
endotypes to those derived from bulk RNA sequencing and apply scRNA-seq-derived signatures to our own
clinical trials data that have obtained bulk RNA sequencing. The proposed studies are highly likely to make
available a simple method to facilitate single-cell immune profiling in multicenter studies to greatly enhance our
understanding of the host immune response in sepsis and guide the development of targeted therapies."

Reduction in functional insulin-secreting β cells underlies the progression of all forms of diabetes, underscoring
the translational relevance of deciphering molecular pathways regulating the formation, growth, and function of
β cells. The transcriptional networks critical for the proper development, differentiation, and expansion of β cells
work through islet enhancers, super enhancers, and active promoters that form 3D hubs. The homeodomain
transcription factor Pdx1 is a critical member of the β-cell transcriptional network during development and in
postnatal β-cell function. Pdx1 is mutated in monogenic forms of human diabetes and plays critical roles in early
pancreas specification, regulation of organ size, and in β-cell formation, proliferation, and identity. Our
preliminary data reveal that developing β cells exhibit altered subnuclear localization and reduced levels of Pdx1
protein as they advance through the cell cycle. Further, ectopically elevated levels of Pdx1 prevent cell cycle
progression, suggesting that dynamic regulation of expression is required for effective β-cell expansion. We
identify an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) in the Pdx1 C-terminus (aa 207-223). IDPRs, commonly
found within transcription factors, lack fixed secondary structure and are amenable to flexible conformations and
phase separation. IDPRs promote protein-protein interactions and transcriptional hub formation at super
enhancers necessary for coordinated gene regulation. We have found that the Pdx1 C-terminus mediates
interaction with the one cut homeodomain transcription factor Oc1 in multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells to
establish the endocrine gene program, with long-term impact on postnatal islet function and β-cell compensation.
We previously identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor SPOP as a PDX1 C-terminus partner (via
aa224-238) that mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PDX1. Our preliminary data suggest
that SPOP and Oc1 compete for interaction with the Pdx1 C-terminus and that Oc1 protects Pdx1 from SPOP-
mediated degradation. Notably, the C-terminus harbors several diabetes-associated human mutations, one of
which we recently found disrupts the PDX1/SPOP interaction. Thus, we hypothesize that PDX1/OC1
interactions, in part mediated by their IDPRs, regulate Pdx1 stability, cell cycle progression, and pancreatic
endocrine differentiation. This hypothesis will be tested in 3 Aims: (1) To determine the mechanisms whereby
Pdx1 and Oc1 cooperate to establish a chromatin landscape permissive for endocrine differentiation and
proliferation; (2) To define the roles of the Pdx1 and Oc1 IDPRs in protein-protein interaction and pancreas
development; and (3) To define the molecular mechanisms by which the Pdx1 C-terminal domain regulates
protein stability and function during pancreas organogenesis and endocrine differentiation. The impact of human
diabetes-associated mutations will be investigated in this context. Our studies will determine a novel and
cohesive role for unstudied structural features of the Pdx1 C-terminus in β-cell development. Results of our
studies will inform therapeutic efforts to optimize β-cell expansion for cell-based therapies."

This project takes a successful and productive R01 – the Drug-Alcohol Pregnancy Policy Study (D-APPS)
Phase 1 – to the next phase and further examines impacts of state pregnancy-specific alcohol policies and
expands focus to identify general population alcohol policies that reduce harms related to alcohol use during
pregnancy. Alcohol is a known teratogen that causes fetal alcohol syndrome and a range of other harms to
fetuses. Alcohol use during pregnancy is common, with 15% of pregnant women reporting any alcohol use and
3% of pregnant women reporting binge drinking in the past month. Despite considerable governmental and
clinical attention to alcohol use during pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy has remained common and
essentially stable for decades in the U.S. Thus, assessing which existing pregnancy-specific and general
population alcohol policies influence harm from alcohol use during pregnancy is imperative. Since the 1970s,
almost all states have enacted one or more policies related to alcohol use during pregnancy. States continue to
enact pregnancy-specific alcohol policies. D-APPS Phase 1 found that most pregnancy-specific alcohol
policies lead to increases in low birthweight and preterm birth and decreases in prenatal care, which results in
thousands of babies born low birthweight or preterm each year. Findings indicate that while alcohol use during
pregnancy causes public health harms, so do the policies adopted in response. Before abandoning pregnancy-
specific alcohol policies, research is needed to see if there are any positive impacts on more severe outcomes
related to alcohol use during pregnancy, such as child morbidities and child maltreatment. Additional research
is also needed to identify other possible policies that might reduce harms from drinking during pregnancy.
General population alcohol policies that address price and availability of alcohol and criminalization of drinking
behavior could also reduce harm related to drinking during pregnancy, but this has not yet been studied
comprehensively. In this project, we assess whether existing pregnancy-specific alcohol policies affect other
outcomes related to drinking during pregnancy and identify general population alcohol policies that reduce
harms related to drinking during pregnancy. We examine whether effects differ by race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status as well as by the other policies in effect at the time. This study uses insurance claims
and Treatment Episode Dataset-Admissions data from the 1990s-present, Natality Birth Data and National
Alcohol Survey Data from the 1970s-present, NIAAA's Alcohol Policy Information System, and other policy
data sources. We will use both epidemiologic and economics-based data analysis approaches to allow for
causal interpretation of findings. Findings will inform ongoing policy debates, advocacy and professional
education efforts by maternal and child health professionals and obstetricians and gynecologists, and inform
policy approaches to reduce harms from drinking during pregnancy."

 Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is an immune-mediated condition affecting many organs. It is
categorized into acute and chronic subtypes. Eyes are affected in 60-90% of the patients with chronic GVHD
resulting in significant visual morbidity. About half of the ocular GVHD (oGVHD) patients develop steroid-
refractory conjunctival and lacrimal fibrosis and severe dry eye, sometimes with ocular perforation and loss of
globe. Pathophysiology of oGVHD remains incompletely understood. The current proposal will investigate the
role of host and donor macrophages, their phenotypic changes, and their crosstalk with fibroblasts and goblet
cells as mechanisms underlying oGVHD-associated ocular surface damage, fibrosis, and dry eye. The long-
term goal is to understand the immune-mediated pathophysiological basis of oGVHD for its prevention and
better therapeutic management. This proposal will use two mouse models of allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation to induce oGVHD. These models recapitulate many features of GVHD-associated ocular
surface damage, including a decrease in tear volume, signs of corneal keratopathy, conjunctival fibrosis, and
loss of goblet cells. Aim 1 will investigate whether irradiation, host macrophage activation, and the influx of
donor marrow-derived macrophages initiate and perpetuate ocular surface injury in oGVHD. Aim 2 will identify
whether profibrotic mediators released by macrophages cause transdifferentiation of conjunctival and lacrimal
gland fibroblasts to elicit oGVHD-associated fibrosis. Aim 2 will also test the role of the fibroblast-mediated
release of macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and other chemokines in recruiting donor
macrophages to the ocular surface. Furthermore, aim 2 will evaluate whether pexidartinib, a CSF-1 receptor
inhibitor, can attenuate oGVHD by depleting conjunctival and lacrimal gland macrophages. Aim 3 will
investigate whether rescue of goblet cell loss by IL-13 can mitigate oGVHD-associated dry eye. Aim 3 will also
identify the macrophage receptors involved in mediating the biological effects of goblet cell mucins. The results
of this study will provide data on the role of host-donor macrophages, their interaction with fibroblasts and
goblet cells as underlying mechanisms in oGVHD pathology and will potentially identify novel therapeutic
approaches for the management of oGVHD."

 Human neurochemistry undergoes dramatic changes in early childhood, due to the rapid pace of
development. However, techniques for assessing neurochemistry non-invasively by magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) in young children are limited. Spectral editing is the gold-standard for detecting MRS
signals from key neurometabolites such as the neurotransmitters glutamate (Glu) and GABA, the
neuromodulators N-acetyl aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) and aspartate (Asp), the redox compounds glutathione
(GSH) and ascorbate (Asc), the anaerobic glycolysis product lactate (Lac), and the membrane lipid precursor
phosphorylethanolamine (PE). Measurement of these lower-concentration metabolites is vital for investigating
healthy and disrupted neurodevelopment, including inhibitory dysfunction, oxidative stress, myelination and
mitochondrial metabolic disruption.
 To date, spectral editing has not been applied at large in pediatrics – arguably the arena in which they will
be leveraged most powerfully for scientific discovery and clinical value. This project will develop acquisition
and analysis tools for multi-metabolite MRS in the pediatric brain, focusing on developing motion-robust
acquisitions. It will also acquire reference data for the best-practice analysis of pediatric spectra, including the
macromolecular background spectrum and metabolite relaxometry.
This project will have a key push-pull interaction with the HEALthy Brain & Child Development (HBCD)
Study, a 25-site national study of neurodevelopmental risk factors (including four sites in this
proposal). HBCD applies the acquisition and analysis methods developed by PI Edden's group
(HERCULES and Osprey), and Drs. Edden and Wisnowski are co-chairs of the HBCD MRS working
group. Dissemination of methods from this project will directly support HBCD, and this new focus on
methods development for pediatric cohorts will allow us to directly address technical issues as they
arise in HBCD. Data acquired during HBCD will supplement the data acquired in this grant as we
develop a profound new understanding of the neurometabolic trajectory of early childhood."

 Gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) are mutations that underlie many genetic diseases. Many
cancers have increased accumulation of GCRs, which likely represents a type of mutator phenotype thought to
be important for the development and progression of these cancers. Consistent with this, some inherited
cancer susceptibility syndromes result from genetic defects that cause increased accumulation of GCRs in
model systems. While many pathways thought to play a role in preventing GCRs have been studied, a
comprehensive understanding of the genes, pathways and mechanisms that prevent accumulation of GCRs is
not available. Understanding these mechanisms will impact on human health for several reasons: 1) Identifying
genes and mechanisms that suppress and promote GCRs will provide tools to identify causes of genome
instability in cancer; 2) The development of PARP inhibitors for treating cancers with BRCA1 and BRCA2
defects has demonstrated that defects causing genome instability are potential therapeutic targets for cancer;
and, 3) Understanding pathways that suppress accumulation of GCRs, including identifying synthetic lethal
partner genes for these pathways, will provide critical information for guiding developing of novel cancer
diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for use in personalized approaches to cancer treatment.
 The goal of this proposal is to use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify genes, pathways and
mechanisms that suppress GCRs that will then guide the development of assays for the formation of GCRs in
human cells. Key related objectives are to identify chromosomal features and aberrant DNA repair
mechanisms that contribute to the formation of GCRs and to identify human genes in which defects cause
genome instability in cancer. The proposed studies will build on the results of work supported by this project
that have resulted in a series of quantitative assays for use in studying GCRs and have identified numerous
genome instability suppressing (GIS) genes and cooperating GIS genes that suppress the accumulation of
GCRs in S. cerevisiae. The following lines of research will be carried out: 1) The mechanistic features of
selected pathways that suppress GCRs will be investigated, focusing on Tor2 (a tumor suppressor
homologue), the cohesion and condensin complexes, and Exonuclease 1; 2) Genetic studies and whole
genome sequencing will be used to identify the genes and mechanisms that suppress or promote GCRs
mediated by the formation of large loop ssDNA hairpin-mediated GCRs and study the genomic features that
underlie the formation of specific GCRs; 3) The mechanistic and genetic features of the formation of individual
GCRs will be studied using a newly developed assay that allows monitoring of the formation of an individual
GCR by PCR; and, 4) GCR assays for use in human cells will be developed and used to investigate defects in
human GIS genes. These studies will provide a comprehensive picture of the pathways and mechanisms that
prevent GCRs in S. cerevisiae and provide insights into the origin of genome instability in cancer."

Although the ability of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) agonists to stimulate insulin secretion
and reduce caloric intake has been recognized for over two decades, surprisingly little is known about
the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. We have previously shown that activation of the
hypothalamic Glp1r reduces food intake by engaging key nutrient sensing mechanisms such as
mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex-1 (mTORC1). Since mTORC1 is also an important
regulatory component of -cell function, this suggests that elucidating how Glp1r agonists regulate
mTORC1 and its downstream targets will address a key knowledge gap about the mechanism of action
of an important class of diabetes and obesity drugs. We have identified a novel interaction stimulated
by the clinically relevant Glp1r agonist liraglutide (Lira) whereby the canonical target of Glp1r signaling,
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), phosphorylates the mTORC1 regulatory protein Raptor
resulting in increased mTORC1 signaling. We have also identified the transcription factor Hypoxia-
Inducible Factor (HIF) as a target of Glp1r signaling. This is relevant since HIF stimulates glycolysis, a
mechanism necessary for the anorectic and insulinotropic effects of Glp1r agonists, and increased HIF
expression in the hypothalamus and -cells reduces food intake and stimulates insulin secretion,
respectively. We also provide preliminary data showing that Lira no longer reduces body weight or
glucose levels in novel knockin mice replacing endogenous Raptor with a PKA-resistant Raptor. Our
preliminary data, therefore, lead us to hypothesize that a Glp1r-PKA-mTORC1-HIF-glycolysis axis in
the hypothalamus and -cells mediates the ability of Lira to reduce body weight (Aim 1) and stimulate
insulin secretion (Aim 2), respectively. The clinical relevance of this is further emphasized by our
preliminary data showing that two variants of the Glp1r found in humans that are associated with
improved cardiometabolic outcomes and improved responsiveness to Lira also stimulate mTORC1
signaling to a greater degree than wild-type Glp1r. We will, therefore, use mice expressing these human
Glp1r variants to test the hypothesis that Lira promotes greater weight loss and improved glucose
tolerance in these mice via enhanced mTORC1 signaling (Aim 3). We will complete these Aims by
leveraging our extensive expertise in assessing metabolic phenotypes in mice, including real-time
measurements of energy balance parameters as well as pancreatic function in isolated islets and in
vivo using hyperglycemic clamps. We will apply these approaches to a suite of novel mouse models
that allow us to modulate or measure the expression and activity of target proteins in specific cell types.
Accomplishing these Aims will delineate specific molecular mechanisms that can be leveraged towards
either the improvement of the effectiveness of Lira or the design of more efficient weight-lowering drugs."

Our current understanding of chromatin transcription has been limited by our knowledge of the factors that are
involved in this process. In this regard, we have identified a novel nucleosome destabilization factor, termed
NDF, that can destabilize nucleosomes and facilitate transcription elongation through nucleosomes. In this
proposal, we will investigate the function of NDF in chromatin dynamics and RNA Polymerase II transcription
elongation using biochemistry, genomics, bioinformatics and structural biology approaches. In Specific Aim 1,
we will develop and employ new methods and strategies to study the molecular mechanism of NDF-mediated
nucleosome destabilization and RNA Polymerase II transcription. We will use ultra-high-resolution optical
tweezer as well as cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the dynamics of NDF-mediated nucleosome
destabilization. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine how NDF is recruited to the transcribed regions of active
genes in cells. We will assess whether other cellular factors, other than H3K36me3 histones, contribute to the
recruitment of NDF. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine how genes lacking NDF are transcribed, and
investigate protein factors that are related to NDF. The studies proposed here should significantly increase our
understanding of the mechanisms of Pol II transcription elongation through chromatin."

NaV1.5 channels are fundamentally involved in the normal function and pathophysiology of the heart. NaV1.5
dysfunction is linked to a variety of life-threatening cardiac diseases, including congenital and acquired cardiac
arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. An emerging commonality for these pathologies is increased
late Na current, that results in sustained Na influx during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential.
Understanding mechanisms that regulate late Na current is pivotal to understanding NaV1.5 dysfunction in
cardiac pathophysiology and for developing long-sought pharmacology. Our recent studies and preliminary data
suggest that late Na current is powerfully tuned by a Na channel modulator named fibroblast growth factor
homologous factor (FHF) that is endogenous to cardiomyocytes. Yet, how FHF accomplishes this important
mode of NaV1.5 regulation and its relevance to disease pathogenic mechanisms is not fully determined. In this
collaborative project, we seek (1) to dissect the molecular mechanism of FHF regulation of late Na current, and
(2) to identify the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of this modulatory scheme. Armed with in depth
mechanistic insights, we seek to engineer novel peptide-based inhibitors of late Na current. In particular, as FHF
undergoes extensive alternative-splicing, we evaluate isoform-specificity of late Na current regulation using a
novel FRET assay and through extensive single-channel analysis. To probe the physiological impact of FHF
regulation of late Na current, we virally manipulate FHF levels in cardiomyocytes differentiated from long-QT and
mixed-syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells as well as transgenic mouse ventricular
myocytes. In so doing, this proposal promises new biophysical and physiological insights into modulation of
cardiac NaV1.5 and inform upon mechanisms underlying variable clinical manifestations of Na channelopathies."

the pancreas and initiates pancreatitis. The premature, ectopic activation of trypsinogen to trypsin is
one of the earliest events in the development of pancreatitis. However, the mechanism of
intrapancreatic trypsin activation has remained contentious as animal experiments and human genetic
studies pointed to different activation pathways. Thus, trypsinogen may be activated by cathepsin B but
it can also undergo autoactivation, when trypsin activates trypsinogen. The respective contribution of
these two mechanisms to trypsin activation associated with pancreatitis onset is unknown. To address
this knowledge gap, we propose three distinct scenarios of trypsinogen activation. 1) In the absence of
increased trypsinogen autoactivation caused by genetic mutations, cathepsin B can induce significant
intrapancreatic trypsin activation, without affecting pancreatitis severity. (2) If genetic mutations in
trypsinogen moderately increase autoactivation, severity of experimentally-induced pancreatitis will
depend on the degree of cathepsin B-mediated trypsinogen activation. (3) Finally, if a genetic change
that causes robust trypsinogen autoactivation, age of onset and severity of spontaneous pancreatitis is
determined by cathepsin B-mediated trypsinogen activation. In this grant proposal, we will test each of
these three pathological circumstances using unique mouse models with trypsinogen mutations.
Successful completion of the proposed project will offer fresh mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis
of pancreatitis and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic and preventive approaches."
10810834,"The current COVID-19 crisis starkly illustrates the need to develop new modalities for the
therapeutic treatment of pathogenic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, including against
novel viruses that have yet to emerge. Human oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) has recently
been determined to be a critical mediator in the replication of a broad spectrum of ssRNA viral
human pathogens, including the enteroviruses, rhinovirus, hepatitis C, Zika virus, Dengue fever
viruses, and coronaviruses. OSBP is an ER-located, non-enzymatic protein reported to function
as an important lipid sensor and lipid transporter in eukaryotic cells. Published research, including
our own recent publications, has established the antiviral activity of structurally-diverse OSBP-
targeting small molecules against multiple RNA pathogenic viruses. These discoveries present
the opportunity for a paradigm shift in antiviral drug development: potentially drug targeting a
human host protein, OSBP, that is required for viral proliferation of a broad-spectrum of RNA
viruses, as opposed to targeting viral proteins present in individual viruses. We have discovered
that transient, low dose treatment with the OSBP-targeting compound OSW-1-compound induces
a longterm, multigenerational repression of OSBP, and the cells with repressed OSBP show a
pronounced inhibition of ssRNA viral replication. Our preliminary results show that the OSW-1-
compound has prophylactic antiviral activity at low nanomolar concentrations against several
ssRNA viruses, including against one coronavirus tested. The longterm repression of OSBP,
triggered by OSW-1, has no effect on cellular division, viability, or morphology.
 The purpose of this proposal is to understand the cellular role of OSBP in innate antiviral
response. Our preliminary results show that OSBP: 1) regulates mTORC1 activity, 2) induces
autophagy; 3) slows global protein translation; and 4) activates alternative splicing nonsense-
mediated decay (AS-NMD) process, which is an RNA regulatory process. All of these OSBP-
involved cellular processes would limit ssRNA viral replication individually, but there is little insight
into the organization of these systems to establish a coordinated antiviral response.Our overall
hypothesis is that OSBP serves in a major regulatory role to coordinate a multifaceted innate
antiviral response to ssRNA infection. We propose a complete model of how OSBP senses early-
stage viral infection and then triggers a multisystem response to block viral replication in cells,
including through modulating mTOR1C activity and the AS-NMD system."
10789951,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents, and it is well recognized
that HIV care and treatment among children (birth to 9 years) and young adolescents (10-14 years) lags behind
that of adults, leading to numerous calls to action. Despite a global consensus toward eliminating new HIV
infections in these age groups, assessing progress against targets is impeded, as current estimates do not
include substantial amounts of locally-available data. Additionally, new HIV infections in young adolescents have
not been quantified. The global HIV burden in these age groups is currently estimated by two groups: the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) study and UNAIDS, both of which currently assume no new HIV infections for those
under 15. Both groups use the Spectrum child model, which relies largely on estimated HIV prevalence among
adult women, treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and other assumptions to estimate the
HIV burden among children and young adolescents. One of the assumptions is that new HIV infections among
those under 15 come from only one source – mother-to-child transmission – assuming no sexual activity and
zero HIV incidence in young adolescents. In addition to behavioral factors, evidence shows that the risk of HIV
transmission is influenced by biomedical factors (e.g., HIV testing rates, antiretroviral therapy coverage) and
structural factors (e.g., national wealth, access to education, health care quality and access). However, there
has been no systematic study of the impact of these factors on the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. Given the
complexity of the epidemic and the interplay of contributing factors, additional data and analyses are needed to
understand the relative impact of these factors. Developing methods to triangulate newly acquired data sources
is crucial to enhancing understanding of the drivers of the epidemic, and to generating more robust HIV burden
estimates for children and adolescents. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to address the limitations of existing
methods by triangulating empirical data sources to produce more accurate and comprehensive estimates of
pediatric HIV burden, including an understanding of how biomedical, behavioral, and structural factors impact
the burden among children and adolescents. Our proposal advances beyond existing work by providing the first-
ever estimates of new HIV infections among young adolescents, and by incorporating these results into an
interactive visualization platform to help key stakeholders understand the current and projected future burden of
HIV/AIDS among children and adolescents under different scenarios. This project is comprised of four Specific
Aims: (1) Incorporate currently unused data sources to estimate mother-to-child transmission and HIV burden
among children (0-9 years); (2) Estimate new infections among young adolescents (10-14 years); (3) Quantify
the impact of biomedical, behavioral, and structural factors on HIV transmission probabilities and mortality among
children and young adolescents; and (4) Forecast future burden of HIV among children and adolescents through
2040 based on current trends in incidence, prevalence, and mortality, and exposure to risk and protective factors."
10836481,"The Yale-DRC Translational Research Core promotes novel and cutting edge clinical research in diabetes and
related metabolic disorders with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that may lead to the treatment,
prevention or ultimately the cure of diabetes. The role of this core is translational: to enable Yale DRC
investigators to harvest the discoveries in basic medicine, and to apply them to investigations to understand
human pathophysiology. While animals models and studies in vitro provide insights into human pathobiology,
the processes in humans may not be equivalent to these experimental systems, therefore ultimately, to gain
knowledge about human disease, studies with humans are necessary. The Overarching Aim of the Yale DRC
Translational Research Core is to provide the infrastructure required to support Yale’s large group of NIH-
funded clinical investigators, who are conducting clinical diabetes research including those serving as Yale
Principal Investigators in NIDDK multi-center studies. During the current grant period, this objective has been
extended to include a full range of support for an outstanding group of emerging young physician investigators
engaged in diabetes research at the Schools of Medicine, Nursing and Public Health. The primary purposes of
the Yale-DRC Translational Research Core are to: 1) in a cost-effective manner provide specialized clinical
and translational research infrastructure for the investigators to conduct complex diabetes-related studies (e.g.
insulin-glucose clamps, magnetic resonance imaging or spectroscopy studies; PET studies, stable isotope
infusions; indirect calorimetry; body composition; muscle biopsies, dietary interventions and closed-loop insulin
delivery) in adults and children with diabetes and related metabolic disorders, 2) centralize personnel and
practices, provide services and reduce the costs, for the Yale DRC membership to enable and facilitate
translational studies. By providing these services, a broad range of investigators may conduct studies with
human material. In addition, through collaborations with the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation, services
needed to conduct investigator-initiated clinical trials are provided, 3) support the training of clinical scientists
who can fulfill the Yale DRC research mission and emerge as leaders in translational investigations. In summary,
the Yale DRC Translational Research Core, which stands alone in its translational mission, represents a vital
asset of the Yale DRC in fulfilling its objectives."
10836489,"Abstract
The Pilot and Feasibility grant program of the Yale DRC is managed through the Pilot and Feasibility Core. The
functions of the Core are to solicit applications from investigators in the Yale School of Medicine and
throughout Yale University, to carry out peer review of the applications, and to select meritorious projects for
support. Grants are awarded for up to 2 years depending on progress that is made in the first year of funding
and plans for the 2nd year. The Core has been directed by Kevan Herold, MD. Sonia Caprio, MD will join as the
Co-Director. The Co-Directors work with an oversight committee that makes final funding selections of grants
for support. Since the inception of the Yale DRC in 1993, interest and applications to the program has been
very high: In the past two funding cycles, 46 applications were supported that had received a median priority
score on review of 2.33. The majority of the applications are from new investigators followed by established
investigators who are new to diabetes. Thus the program continues to be an important tool for building the
research base for diabetes investigation at Yale. Current key personnel in the DRC began their careers with
P+F awards from the Yale DRC. Many of the awardees have used the P+F award to obtain preliminary data to
apply for external grant support. In the past 2 funding cycles there have been over 20 new external grants
made to P+F investigators and the estimated return on investment of the P+F program is 15-fold. The studies
supported by the P+F program have resulted in more than 40 peer -reviewed publications during the last two
funding cycles. The P+F program has also been a mechanism for initiation of new collaborations often
between basic and translational scientists. Examples of these collaborations include studies of innate immune
pathways that are associated with hepatic insulin resistance cellular mechanisms of glucose metabolism in
adipocytes, and brain metabolism. In summary, the P+F core plays a vital role in new discoveries, attracting
new investigators to the diabetes field, and recruiting established investigators who are new to diabetes or are
developing a new area of diabetes-related research. In the future, we plan to extend the impact of the P+F
program by co-supporting P+F awards with the Liver Center, Yale Center for Clinical Investigation and the
Pepper Center for Aging."
10848183,"All living cells possess mechanisms that partition the chromosomal DNA into actively transcribed,
accessible domains, and transcriptionally silent domains densely packed by DNA-bound proteins. In
Escherichia coli, nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) assemble into nucleoprotein filaments that cover
several kilobase-long regions of DNA, silencing expression of horizontally acquired xenogenes, virulence
factors or enzymes needed for utilization of exotic nutrients. While silencing of promoters, frequently by
exclusion of RNA polymerase, is well studied, silencing during RNA chain elongation has only recently
come to light. E. coli H-NS and its homolog StpA are NAPs that directly bind to AT-rich DNA and inhibit
transcription initiation and elongation. The available data show that the transcription elongation complex
is involved in both maintenance and relief of NAP-mediated silencing. Recent data implicate the ω
subunit of RNA polymerase in regulation of global DNA topology and transcription of xenogeneic regions.
A universally conserved elongation factor, NusG, and termination factor Rho, which are associated with
RNA polymerase genome-wide and stop synthesis of RNAs that are not actively translated, cooperate
with H-NS to silence xenogenes and other inactive genes. Conversely, we showed that a specialized
NusG paralog, RfaH, which is required for expression of xenogeneic operons, excludes NusG and Rho
from the transcribing RNA polymerase and counteracts NAP-mediated silencing. We propose to
elucidate molecular mechanisms which control the accessibility of bacterial chromatin, focusing on poorly
understood regulation during transcription elongation. In Aim 1, we will investigate effects of the
ubiquitous ω subunit on RNA polymerase structure and activity. We will identify cellular factors that
interact with ω using genetics and proteomics, characterize ω-induced changes in transcription
complexes, and investigate ω effects on in vitro RNA synthesis. In Aim 2, we will study regulation of Rho-
dependent termination. We posit that hyperactive Rho may be harmful during slow growth or translational
stress and will investigate mechanisms by which Rho activity may be globally downregulated, e.g., by
changing Rho conformation, promoting the formation of inactive Rho filaments, or blocking Rho binding
to RNA. In Aim 3, we will identify new factors that contribute to maintenance of E. coli heterochromatin;
determine contributions of different NAPs, Rho, and ω to silencing; and elucidate the molecular
mechanism by which RfaH counter-silences NAPs in vitro."
10786086,"1 Summary:
 2 CD4 T cell activation provides a model system for studying molecular mechanisms that coordinate a wide variety
 3 of often competing physiological processes. When CD4 T cells encounter an antigen in the proper context, they
 4 rapidly accumulate biomass, undergo extensive expansion, and differentiate into functional lineages that spe-
 5 cialize on cytokine production. Robust and effective CD4 T cell-mediated immune responses require proper al-
 6 location of metabolic resources through the central carbon metabolic pathways to sustain energetically costly
 7 processes like growth, proliferation, and cytokine production. Also, ancillary metabolic pathways, such as amino
 8 acid catabolism and polyamine (PA) biosynthesis, are critical to regulating T cell proliferation and inflammation.
 9 The objective of this proposal is to understand how the arginine-polyamine metabolic axis is regulated during
10 T cell activation and ultimately contributes to inflammation and autoimmunity. Our lab recently revealed that the
11 transcription factor, c-Myc, controls an ancillary metabolic pathway that connects arginine (Arg) catabolism to
12 the biosynthesis of PAs, which are an essential class of polycationic metabolites ubiquitously present in all living
13 organisms. Unlike most other amino acids that are primarily used for anabolic protein synthesis during T cell
14 activation, most cellular Arg is catabolized and funneled into synthesizing PA (Arg-PA metabolic axis). Genetic
15 and pharmacological perturbation in the intracellular PA pool suppresses proliferation, suppresses TH1 and TH17
16 differentiation, but enhances iTreg differentiation. Hence, we hypothesize that the arginine-polyamine metabolic
17 axis orchestrates a metabolic checkpoint to optimize CD4 Teff cell proliferation and inflammatory re-
18 sponse. This checkpoint may be therapeutically exploited by polyamine blocking therapies. The aims of
19 this proposal are to 1) decipher the Arg-PA metabolic axis reprogramming and assess the impact of crucial
20 metabolic steps on Teff cells in the context of modulating Myc; 2) determine the outcomes of modulating Arg-PA
21 axis in regulating the effector function of T cells; 3) assess the contribution of PA de novo biosynthesis and the
22 PA salvage pathway to the intracellular PA-pool and T cell proliferation and effector function, and 4) develop and
23 test complementary enzymatic, genetic, and dietary strategies to exploit the Arg-PA axis to modulate inflamma-
24 tory response and autoimmunity in animal models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Collectively, the
25 expected outcomes of this project are significant as it will reveal the fundamental principles of the emerging
26 connections between cell metabolism, immune signaling, and T cell differentiation. These studies are critical to
27 developing novel approaches and therapeutic interventions that improve clinical outcomes of inflammatory and
28 autoimmune diseases."

 This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. The
goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate with the advanced skills needed to establish an independent
research program in the area of glaucoma diagnostic testing with special expertise in test error correction and
predictive modeling of future glaucoma outcomes. To facilitate this long-term goal, in the current proposal, the
candidate’s main research goal is to reduce the time and number of tests necessary to detect glaucoma
worsening by (1) correcting for errors in previously obtained visual field (VF) and peripapillary optical
coherence tomography (OCT) tests by using multilevel models with Bayesian analysis (MLB) and generative
adversarial networks (GAN) (2) stratifying eyes at high and low risk for rapid glaucoma worsening at the
baseline clinical visit using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). These aims are based on high quality
preliminary data which show that: (1) the effect of VF reliability metrics and OCT signal strength on test error
can be quantified and thus corrected for and (2) machine learning methods can predict risk of future VF
progression with fair accuracy with baseline visit VF data alone and therefore adding structural (OCT) and
clinical information from the baseline visit is likely to improve model accuracy. The main hypotheses of the
proposed research aims are (1) correcting for test errors with MLB and GAN will reduce the time needed to
detect worsening by 10 and 20% respectively (2) combining baseline visit structural (OCT), functional (VF) and
clinical data as inputs into DCNNs will allow us to achieve an area under the receiver operating curve of at
least 0.8 at predicting the risk of future rapid glaucoma worsening. The candidate proposes a comprehensive
training plan, combining formal coursework, meetings, seminars and workshops overseen by his diverse group
of mentors. Specific training goals include: (1) Receiving training in multi-level regression modeling and
Bayesian analysis techniques. (2) Becoming adept at data science with a special emphasis on learning
Python for data extraction, manipulation and analysis. (3) Furthering knowledge of machine learning
techniques with a specific emphasis on deep learning including DCNNs and GANs. (4) Continuing training in
the ethical and responsible conduct of research. The training plan will be executed in coordination with the set
of research activities mentioned above. Results from this research proposal will be used to develop a
subsequent R01 research proposal that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent researcher."

 We are developing eCD4-Ig, an antibody-like molecule constructed from CD4, a coreceptor-mimetic
peptide, and an antibody Fc, as a long-acting injectable therapeutic for HIV. Our progress to-date
includes having extended the plasma half-life of eCD4-Ig to the point that it now rivals or surpasses that
of the leading broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) being developed as long-acting injectables. In a
head-to-head comparison of pharmacokinetics (PK) in the human FcRn-transgenic mouse model,
eCD4-Ig had significantly better PK than a VRC01 protein that had a half-life of 71 days in humans
(Gaudinski et al., PLoS Med, 2018). With support from NIAID, we have developed a CHO cell line for
manufacturing eCD4-Ig under cGMP conditions. However, in-depth analysis of the composition of the
N-linked glycans (NLGs) at N297 of the Fc of the protein made by the cell line has highlighted a
problem shared by the entire field: The large majority of the NLGs are forms detrimental to PK. This
problem is particularly pronounced among the afucosylated forms that are active for antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Indeed, only a few percent of the NLGs are afucosylated
forms that allow both ADCC and a long half-life. Therefore, we propose glycoengineering our cell line
for manufacturing eCD4-Ig. To do so, we will develop a glycoengineering gene cassette, introduce it
into the cell line, and derive a glycoengineered clone for manufacturing eCD4-Ig under cGMP
conditions. Although our primary goal is to manufacture eCD4-Ig protein consisting almost entirely of a
single long-lived glycoform that is active for ADCC, the same glycoengineering gene cassette can be
used to manufacture other antibody therapeutics, including bNAbs, to similarly extend effector function
and plasma half-life. This work will reduce the therapeutic concentration and increase the interval at
which long-acting protein therapeutics for treating and preventing HIV infection can be dosed."

Broadly neutralizing antibodies are likely to be an important component of an HIV-1 vaccine. The HIV-1 Envelope
(Env) glycoprotein is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and has been a focus of immunogen designs. Yet
diverse recombinant (rec) Envs do not display detectable binding to the inferred germline (gl) of certain bNAbs,
such as the VRC01-class bNAbs, which are the focus of our IPCAVD project. Rec Envs capable of binding
glVRC01 bNAbs have been designed and induced the production of glVRC01 bNAbs when used as
immunogens. In this IPCAVD, we propose to determine if self-amplifying (sa) mRNA expressing our germline-
targeting 426c.Mod.Core prime and HxB2.WT.Core boost immunogens, expressed either as secreted
nanoparticles (-C4b) or membrane-anchored (gp160ΔCT), will initiate the maturation of VRC01 B cell response
in humans. The Scientific Core Two will provide high quality reagents to Scientific Projects One and Two and
Scientific Core One of this IPCAVD as well as structural information on selected vaccine-elicited Mab of interest
in complex with their antigens, to delineate their epitopes. This information will help us to better understand the
B cell response elicited by the saRNA constructs compared to rec Env immunogens."
10771243,"ABSTRACT PROJECT ONE
We have reported on the design of a germline-targeting recombinant (rec) HIV-1 Env-derived immunogen,
426c.Mod.Core-C4b, that activates naïve B cells that express germline VRC01-class BCRs and on “booster”
rec protein immunogen, HxB2.WT.Core-C4b, that improves the maturation of the VRC01-class antibodies
elicited by 426c.Mod.Core-C4b. This maturation is, however, incomplete and additional immunizations with
heterologous Envs, yet to be identified, will be necessary to complete the maturation process that leads to the
production of broadly neutralizing VRC01-class antibodies. The identification of such Envs will require
extensive experimentation. To expedite this process, we are exploring alternative vaccination methodologies to
rec protein immunizations, such as self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine platforms. RNA vaccines offer
several advantages over rec protein immunogens as the RNA immunogen sequences can easily be modified,
they are more easily produced, and they do not require extensive purification steps. Also, they are less
expensive and faster to GMP-manufacture and they do not require adjuvants. So far however, not much is
known on how the quality of anti-Env B cell and antibody responses elicited by saRNA vaccines and by
adjuvanted rec Env protein immunogens compare. To address this point, in this Scientific Project One, we will
characterize the VRC01 B cell and antibody responses elicited by the 426c.Mod.Core-C4b germline-targeting
Env and the HxB2.WT.Core-C4b boost Env when delivered by saRNA vaccines. We will compare these
responses to those generated by the corresponding adjuvanted rec protein nanoparticles. We will also
examine whether the form of the immunogen expressed by the saRNA vaccines (either as secreted protein
nanoparticles or as membrane-anchored proteins) influences the quality of the VRC01 B cell and antibody
responses. In addition, the qualities of the VRC01 B cell and antibody responses will be evaluated in the
following three prime-boost modalities: (a) saRNA prime and saRNA boost; (b) saRNA prime and rec protein
boost; and (c) rec protein prime and saRNA boost. We propose an accelerated immunization schedule that
relies on our expertise on VRC01-class antibodies, Env-immunogen-design, BCR analysis and antibody
characterization, as well as our expertise with saRNA vaccine modalities. Our proposed studies are central to
the goals of this IPCAVD grant."

Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is a highly prevalent and impactful condition with significant burden on the
healthcare system. Across the lifespan, dysphagia is associated with excess risk of mortality, increased length
of stay, aspiration pneumonia, and malnutrition thereby elevating medical costs and resource utilization. Not only
a health problem, dysphagia also adversely affects quality of life and daily function with disproportionate impact
on cancer survivors. Adoption of evidence-based methods into clinical practice lags decades behind discovery.
One such gap is adoption of evidence-based practices (EBP) by speech-language pathologists in dysphagia
management. Evidence-based dysphagia care begins with evidence-based swallowing evaluation. Significant
progress has been made in the field of dysphagia to develop evidence-based evaluation methods, with particular
emphasis on physiologic characterization of swallowing. The relative safety and efficiency of swallowing, that is
how well a food or liquid bolus is kept out of the airway and clears fully through the pharynx into the esophagus,
is a fundamental driver of clinical decision making – yet, remains inconsistently assessed and reported in clinical
practice. To address this gap, the investigators’ developed DIGEST™ (Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing
Toxicity). DIGEST is an EBP tool to grade the severity of pharyngeal dysphagia based on results of a
radiographic (videofluoroscopic) modified barium swallow (MBS) study. DIGEST uses a basic flowsheet and
rubric (available open access via PMC) to summarize the patterns of penetration/aspiration and pharyngeal
residue observed on the MBS as markers of swallowing safety and efficiency. DIGEST is a pragmatic yet robust
measure validated in the head and neck cancer population, and adopted into routine practice at the PI’s institution
with over 11,000 MBS graded in the clinic using the methodology since development in 2016. Peer-reviewed
research shows adoption of DIGEST in external academic medical settings and federally funded clinical trials.
Despite this promise, several obstacles still limit widespread adoption in routine cancer care. These include
scalability to fit diverse clinical contexts outside the PI’s environment and uncertainty about best implementation
strategies. The long-term goal of this project is to improve dysphagia care and patient outcomes through reliable
adoption of DIGEST into routine clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that DIGEST scales-up maintaining
validity in diverse cancer populations under common clinical practice variations with reliable adoption facilitated
by an active implementation strategy. The objective of this application is to use dissemination and
implementation (D&I) science to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) demonstrate validity of DIGEST in
diverse oncology populations and imaging acquisition protocols, 2) examine context and fidelity of natural
dissemination of DIGEST in real-world, early adopters, and 3) evaluate active implementation strategies to
improve reach and fidelity of DIGEST in clinical practice. With dense multi-site networks and content expertise,
the investigators are uniquely equipped to conduct the proposed D&I project. We expect this work to improve
care by narrowing the research-to-practice gap in dysphagia diagnostics."

10747442,"Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause a chronic, debilitating disease afflicting
>200 million people in >70 countries. Since there are limited anti-schistosome drugs
available and since these is no vaccine to prevent infection, we aim here to generate and
test nanobody-based immunotherapeutics targeting essential surface-exposed parasite
proteins as a novel intervention to control schistosomiasis. Nanobodies (camelid single-
domain antibodies or VHHs) are small, versatile binding agents that can be multimerized
for enhanced activities and delivered effectively by formulated mRNA. We have identified
and characterized three S. mansoni tegumental ectoenzymes (SmNPP5, SmT-AChE,
SmCA) that represent novel molecular targets for intervention to treat schistosomiasis.
Each of the three enzymes is exposed at the host parasite interface and each is essential
for the parasite to infect its vertebrate host. We aim to generate nanobodies that inhibit the
function of these three target enzymes (each enzyme has been purified in functional form
in CHO-S cells). The small size, stability to heat and pH extremes, low immunogenicity,
and facility to express as multimers with enhanced activities, makes VHHs preferred
therapeutic agents. We exploit advances in RNA therapeutics as our strategy to efficiently
and economically deliver sustained levels of serum VHH-based therapeutics. Our overall
goal is to generate a simple, practical, and potent anti-schistosome therapeutic that
curtails disease at all stages of infection. In sum, we have identified new, well
characterized, accessible and rational targets for anti-schistosome intervention, and
we incorporate an innovative, novel, cutting-edge approach to control
schistosomiasis. We have assembled a strong team and have on-hand all reagents and
tools necessary to ensure the success of this project. Our data will act as a proof of
principle supporting an approach that, in the longer term, could form the basis of a new
therapeutic for human schistosomiasis, as well as for other debilitating helminth diseases."
10789985,"Project Summary
 The work described in this proposal aims to address the longstanding challenge of controlling the
enantioselectivity and regioselectivity of synthetically valuable reactions mediated by radical intermediates. This
work will develop novel mechanisms for generating free radical intermediates within protein active sites.
Evolution of the protein will be conducted to enhance the chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity of the reactions
performed within their protein active site. Building on findings in the previous funding period, we will develop
couplings reactions between nitronates and alkyl halides. These reactions have two possible products: a redox-
neutral reaction to afford chiral 𝛼-tertiary nitroalkanes and a reductive coupling to prepare cross-coupled
products. We will design catalysts to favor each outcome. Secondly, we will develop a regioselective coupling
of alkyl radicals with arenes. In this project, we will engineer the protein scaffold to favor functionalization at
positions that are untouched using existing synthetic methods. Thirdly, we will explore alkene
difunctionalization. In one manifold, we will oxidize radical intermediates to form carbocations which can be
quenched with various nucleophiles. In a second approach, we will exploit Smiles rearrangements for radical
termination. These approaches will enable the rapid synthesis of highly substituted products while also enabling
the development of catalysts to precisely control the stereochemistry of stereocenters formed in C–C bond-
forming events. In this application, we will also develop a new strategy for radical initiation using oxidative
decarboxylation. This activation mode will be applied to the synthesis of secondary amines. Finally, we will
create a biocatalytic cross-coupling reaction, where alkylated flavin adducts mimic the reactivity of
organometallic intermediates. This method will enable the coupling of carboxylic acids and alkyl halides without
using a metalloprotein. Together, these methods and the goals proposed in the Specific Aims have the potential
to streamline the synthesis of biological probes and drug targets, creating a significant benefit to human health
and associated biomedical sciences."

Zona incerta (ZI), a brain region located between the ventral thalamus and the hypothalamus, has been revealed
to regulate food intake by latest findings. We reported that g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the ZI regulate
food intake through inhibitory projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT). In addition to GABA neurons,
dopamine (DA) neurons have been found in the ZI for decades. However, little is known about their function in
the behavioral regulation. In our pilot studies, we used TH-Cre mice to target ZI DA neurons and found that
chemogenetic activation of ZI DA neurons potently increased motivation to obtain food reward. Based on our
pilot data, we hypothesize that: 1) ZI DA neurons regulate feeding motivation to control food consumption. 2)
ZI DA neurons encode feeding behaviors and respond to metabolic hunger signals. 3) the PVT serves as one of
the important postsynaptic areas for ZI DA neurons to exert the functional control on feeding. To test our
hypothesis, we will use adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to induce Cre-dependent expression of excitatory
hM3Dq, inhibitory hM4Di, or ChR2 selectively in ZI DA neurons of TH-Cre mice. Chemogenetic activation and
silencing will be employed to selectively manipulate ZI DA neurons for testing their role in the control of food
motivation using progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement and real-time food consumption and meal
pattern using Feeding Experimental Devices (FED). We will also use optogenetics to selectively activate ZI DA
projections to determine the role of PVT neurons in feeding regulation induced by ZI DA neurons. In addition to
the behavioral studies, we will perform slice electrophysiology in combination with optogenetics to dissect
functional ZI DA pathways. In vivo fiber photometry will be applied to examine how ZI DA neurons encode feeding
behaviors including food seeking and consumption and slice electrophysiology will be used to study the activity
response of ZI DA neurons to metabolic hunger signals. Together, the proposed studies in this application will
reveal novel ZI DA pathways in feeding control. The expected outcome from the proposed studies will
significantly expand our view of how ZI and central DA signaling regulate feeding motivation and food
consumption."
10682475,"Cognitive impairment is prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed among the 1 million Americans living with
multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, 67% of adults with MS demonstrate cognitive impairment, particularly slowed
cognitive processing speed (CPS), and this is associated with worse fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality
of life (QOL). This underscores the importance of identifying efficacious approaches for managing CPS
impairment and its consequences among those with MS. There is merit in a remotely-delivered physical activity
(PA) intervention for managing MS-related CPS dysfunction in MS. We have provided evidence from a pilot,
randomized controlled trial (RCT) that an Internet-delivered PA intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful
improvement in CPS among those with mild MS-related ambulatory disability; there were additional
improvements in fatigue, depression, anxiety, and QOL. Importantly, the pilot RCT did not a priori recruit
persons with MS who had objective CPS impairment nor examine sustainability of CPS changes over time,
and it further involved a waitlist control that did not account for the effects of attention and social contact. We
leverage our experiences and preliminary results, and propose an appropriately-powered, Phase-II, RCT of a
highly-developed and refined Internet-delivered PA intervention for yielding immediate and sustained
improvements in remotely-assessed CPS among persons with mild MS-related ambulatory disability who
demonstrate impaired CPS. The proposed study, if successful, will provide Class I evidence regarding the
efficacy of a 6-month, Internet-delivered, PA intervention compared with an active control condition for
improving important outcomes in 280 adults with MS who present with both mild MS ambulatory disability and
impaired CPS. The primary outcome is the remotely-delivered Symbol Digit Modalities Test as a measure of
CPS; the secondary outcomes are self-report measures of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and QOL; the tertiary
outcome is accelerometry as a device-based measure of PA. The conditions will be delivered by persons who
are uninvolved in screening, recruitment, random assignment, and outcome assessment. We will collect
outcome data on 3 occasions over a 12-month period (i.e., pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and
6-month follow-up). The outcome data will be collected using a blinded assessor. Data analyses will involve
intent-to-treat principles, and mixed-effects models and logistic regression. The proposed research may yield
“real-world” guidelines for free-living PA change that can be implemented for the treatment of CPS impairment
in MS. Such an opportunity for rehabilitation of cognitive function using an approach with broad reach and
scalability is paramount considering the prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed nature of CPS impairment in
MS and limited resources for its treatment. The proposed research is further consistent with the National
Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research’s mission of fostering the development of scientific knowledge for
enhancing the health, productivity, independence, and QOL."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth reduces quality and years of life. Disparities in T2D emerge early in life and
disproportionately impact low-income and minority youth. T2D is the result of complex processes involving
biological susceptibility and interdependent social, behavioral, and environmental factors that represent the root
causes of disparities. Obesity, insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction have been the focus of many
clinical studies aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of T2D in youth. However, multiple factors directly
and indirectly contribute to risk including unhealthy behaviors, puberty, genetic predisposition, and epigenetic
modulation. These additional factors are influenced by the social and environmental context that must but
considered to advance our understanding of T2D in high-risk populations. Our transdisciplinary team has
extensive experience understanding, preventing, and managing T2D among vulnerable and underrepresented
youth. For over a decade, our research has been guided by a Community Advisory Board that has informed
multiple NIH-funded studies focused on T2D in vulnerable populations. Our overall approach to T2D research
is framed within an Expanded Ecodevelopmental Model that considers cultural, environmental, and social
contexts that influence individual health behaviors and health outcomes during critical life periods. We will apply
this model and leverage high-volume pediatric endocrine practice situated within one of the nation’s largest
integrated pediatric healthcare systems to recruit a diverse sample of youth with obesity and prediabetes. To
further support this work, we have developed a robust community engagement strategy to ensure that the
research extends the available science AND advances towards health equity in the local community. Our
transdisciplinary team is well-suited to contribute to a national consortium that identifies high-risk youth,
understands the pathophysiology of T2D, and ultimately improves the health of this population.
With this context, we propose the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Enroll, phenotype, and prospectively follow an ethnically diverse cohort of 6000 (400/site)
children ages 8-14 with obesity and prediabetes.
Specific Aim 2: Integrate free living assessments of glycemia and health behaviors.
Specific Aim 3: Document family, social and environmental conditions that contribute to T2D risk.
Specific Aim 4: Collect and bank fasting blood samples to support genomic and metabolomic analyses using
validation and discovery approaches.
Specific Aim 5: Examine the individual and potential interactive effects of biological, behavioral, and social
determinants of T2D risk."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by hyperactivation of T cells, B cells and dendritic
cells (DCs), production of autoantibodies to nucleic acid-associated and other self-molecules, and immune
complex-mediated inflammatory damage in multiple organs. Mechanistic assessments in both mouse
models and humans have implicated innate immune pathways of nucleic acid sensing in lupus
pathogenesis, particularly Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDCs), production of type I interferons, and expression of an interferon-inducible gene signature often
correlating with disease activity. Additional studies including by our laboratory have shown that pathogenic
TLR responses in systemic autoimmunity require the participation of the peptide/histidine transporter
SLC15A4, suggesting that inhibition of this transporter may be an effective therapeutic approach. Very
recent studies, however, suggested that SLC15A4 does not act as a transporter but rather as binding
partner of TASL, which in turn facilitates TLR signaling. Thus, the focus of this proposal is to define
mechanistically how SLC15A4 and TASL contribute to TLR activation. For this we will use a novel TASL-
deficient mouse model that will allow to separate the SLC15A4 role as a transporter vs. its role as a platform
that facilitates recruitment of TASL. Crucially, these studies will clarify if pharmacologic inhibition of the
SLC15A4 transporter activity is an appropriate strategy, or if instead targeting TASL would be a better
approach to reduce inflammatory responses in lupus and other autoimmune conditions."
10746464,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Synapses are fundamental units of communication in the nervous system, where immense
diversity in structure and function serve to tune and calibrate information transfer. Defects in the
ability of synapses to properly diversify contribute to the etiology of a variety of
neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. One means of generating
diversity in synaptic function is through molecular heterogeneity, where combinations of distinct
genes are expressed at individual synapses to enable specific functional properties. However, it
has become increasingly clear, though difficult to resolve, that remarkable synaptic diversity can
be achieved from a limited set of molecular machinery. In principle, the Drosophila neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) is a uniquely powerful model to address how synaptic diversity is generated given
the sophisticated genetic, electrophysiological, and imaging approaches. In this system, two
distinct motor neurons converge to co-innervate individual muscle targets, where transmission
from a strong and weak input together drive muscle contraction in the motor circuit. However, an
inability to selectively isolate transmission from either input has been a major limitation towards
understanding synaptic diversity in this system. Here, we propose to use expression of a unique
Botulinum NeuroToxin (BoNT) to selectively silence transmission at strong or weak synaptic
inputs. Preliminary data suggests that while each neuron is largely composed of the same
molecular machinery at active zones, one core component, previously thought to function
universally at all active zones, actually subserves dramatically different roles at strong vs weak
synapses. We will use BoNT silencing, super resolution imaging, and the latest calcium reporters
targeted to release sites to illuminate differences in active zone nanostructure and function
between strong and weak synapses. We will also leverage new innovations in CRISPR
mutagenesis to dissect the specialized functions of eight core active zone components at strong
vs weak synapses. Finally, we will interrogate how these core active zone components are
uniquely targeted for modulation and remodeling at strong vs weak synapses in the context of
homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Together, these approaches will unlock fundamental insights into
how glutamatergic synaptic diversity is established and adaptively modified through plasticity.
Ultimately, this understanding will illuminate key mechanisms through which heterogeneous
functional properties at glutamatergic release sites are enabled by a limited molecular toolkit."
10796830,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is on the rise among youth in the US and worldwide, and disproportionately affects racial
and ethnic minority populations including American Indians. The number of at-risk youth continues to increase
alongside the child obesity epidemic, with an unprecedented proportion of youth developing T2D during puberty.
The public health implications of this trend are highly significant, as debilitating complications are likely to
manifest by early adulthood during what should be the most active and productive years of life. Prevention of
youth-onset T2D is crucial as the course of disease is more aggressive than the typical “adult-onset T2D”. Yet
current knowledge of the pathophysiology of youth-onset T2D is limited, so it is still unclear whom to target or
how to prevent youth-onset T2D. Puberty is a critical period for T2D development, as this life stage is
characterized by marked changes in insulin sensitivity that do not always resolve by the end of puberty. Prior
studies largely used cross-sectional or case-control designs, or longitudinal protocols that rarely spanned the
duration of puberty, precluding a holistic synthesis of how longitudinal patterns of change in biomarkers of
glucose-insulin homeostasis culminate in youth-onset T2D. Deciphering the pathways leading to youth-onset
T2D is fundamental to understanding pre-clinical disease progression, which has potential to directly inform
targeted prevention approaches. With RFA-DK-21-002, the NIDDK seeks to establish a cohort of early pubertal
youth at risk for T2D to better understand the pathophysiology of youth-onset T2D. We propose here a
Colorado|Navajo clinical site that will recruit for this consortium 400 rural-dwelling American Indian youth, the
subgroup at highest risk for youth-onset T2D. Under leadership from the University of Colorado, this clinical site
will be based in a rural community on the Navajo Nation where we have conducted youth diabetes research
since 2000. We will enroll youth in early puberty (Tanner Stages 2-3) who have elevated risk for youth-onset
T2D based on overweight or obesity status (BMI ≥85th percentile) and self-identification with American Indian
race. Participants will be followed for 33 months, on average, undergoing annual 2-hour oral glucose tolerance
tests (n= 3-4 per participant) and semi-annual visits (n= 3-4 per participant) for collection of additional
biospecimens and data on physiological, behavioral, familial, and psychosocial factors associated with T2D risk.
Our specific aims are: 1) locally, recruit 400 American Indian youth in the early stages of puberty (Tanner stage
2-3) with overweight or obesity, and follow them longitudinally to assess the risk of T2D; 2) across the consortium,
identify patterns of change in biomarkers of glucose-insulin homeostasis that culminate in development of youth-
onset T2D; and 3) across the consortium, develop prediction models for youth-onset T2D and identify sub-
phenotypes of incident youth-onset T2D."
10818374,"Machine learning (ML) is poised to enable faster and more accurate interpretation of medical images by
augmenting the capabilities of experts. The cost and difficulty of generating expert quality labelled image data
is the primary limitation preventing faster progress and deployment in more domains. Success of ML
techniques for medical image interpretation may reduce the burden on radiologists, reducing errors arising
from fatigue or interruption, while simultaneously reducing costs and increasing speed and accuracy for
patients. Our overall objective for this research is to dramatically reduce the burden of creating high quality
reference labels by requiring only a small set of such labels from experts. We propose to address this problem
by creating innovative algorithms that will construct reference quality labelled data with little input from domain
experts, thus dramatically reducing the cost of labelling. This will enable us to apply ML techniques to generate
high quality labels of the large amounts of unlabeled data that are already available, which in turn will facilitate
the assessment of potential quantitative imaging biomarkers. We will develop, extend and evaluate novel
algorithms that represent three distinct strategies for reducing labelling cost. These three strategies are
learning from unlabelled data incorporating a novel strategy for characterizing uncertainty, optimizing sample
selection for expert quality labelling with a novel form of Active Learning especially suited for deep learning,
and reducing the cost of achieving quality labeling by replacing or augmenting an expert with a crowd of
inexperts. We will then implement and distribute these novel algorithms, facilitating the replication of our
experiments. Finally, we will demonstrate the practical efficacy of these three strategies by applying them to
the important challenge of identifying quantitative imaging biomarkers that best capture alterations in brain
structure that are associated with characteristics of ASD. These fundamental advances in informatics
algorithms will reduce the cost and increase the rate of obtaining quality labels, which will in turn facilitate the
widespread adoption and deployment of machine learning algorithms for image interpretation. Ultimately, this
will stimulate the development of new imaging biomarkers that hold the potential to dramatically improve
clinical decision-making and patient outcomes."
10831431,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rate of weight gain in the first year of life is a robust risk factor for future obesity. The use of food to soothe
has been linked to greater weight gain and has been theorized to contribute to future reward-driven or
emotional overeating. However, avoiding the use of food to soothe is challenging for mothers, particularly for
children who are less easily soothed by other strategies. Conceptual models to date have viewed infant
distress due to hunger as distinct from infant distress due to other causes. These models encourage a
separation of food as nutrition from food as soothing. However, diverse literatures converge to suggest that
emotion, mother-infant attachment, maternal feeding, and infant eating behavior are appropriately intertwined
and co-develop in adaptive ways. This proposal seeks to test an entirely novel comprehensive model of
bidirectional biobehavioral mechanisms underlying the development of an integrated system of emotion,
attachment, and nutritive intake in the mother-infant dyad across birth, 3 months, and 6 months. Further, we
propose to test the association of this system with maternal feeding behavior, child eating behavior, dietary
intake, and adiposity to age 3 years. Using novel experimental methods in a cohort of 120 children, we will
address the following aims: Aim 1: To test the cross-lagged associations of maternal-infant dyadic stress
physiology and maternal-infant dyadic oxytocin physiology with feeding to soothe and infant adiposity. H1a:
Greater maternal and infant cortisol response and heart rate elevation in response to an infant stressor
predicts more use of feeding to soothe and greater infant adiposity. H1b: Lower maternal and infant oxytocin
response to caregiving predicts greater use of feeding to soothe, and greater infant adiposity. Aim 2: To test
the cross-lagged associations of sucrose effects on infant opioid physiology with feeding to soothe and infant
adiposity. H2: Behavioral response to sucrose characterized by greater relief of pain, greater relief of distress,
and greater hedonic response predicts greater use of feeding to soothe and greater infant adiposity. Aim 3: To
test the cross-lagged associations of the potency of maternal social interaction effects on infant eating with
feeding to soothe and infant adiposity. H3: Greater effect of social interaction on increasing infant willingness to
work for food, reducing capacity for caloric compensation, and relieving distress following a feeding delay
predicts greater use of feeding to soothe and greater infant adiposity. Aim 4: To test the association of the
‘emotion-attachment- nutritive intake-system’ in infancy with maternal feeding behavior, child eating behavior,
child dietary intake, and child adiposity at age 3 years. H4: Greater maternal-infant dyadic stress physiology,
lower maternal-infant dyadic oxytocin physiology, greater sucrose effects on infant opioid physiology, and
greater potency of maternal social interaction effects on eating in infancy predicts greater indulgent feeding,
eating in the absence of hunger, overeating following caloric preload, reinforcing value of food, affective
response to food delay, dietary intake of sweets, and adiposity at age 3 years."

Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease, more rapidly progressive than adult-onset
disease, and is associated with increased comorbidities. Yet, it is not clear which high-risk youth will eventually
progress to T2D. T2D pathogenesis is related to complex hormonal mechanisms that result in β-cell dysfunction,
influenced by genetic, epigenetic, social and environmental factors. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
prevent youth-onset T2D. Our aims are to identify the risk factors and pathophysiologic changes that lead to the
development of youth-onset T2D. We will collaborate as a member of a consortium of clinical centers to achieve
these aims. We will leverage our community and stakeholders’ engagement, our robust research infrastructure
and the diverse high-risk patient population at our Center, to recruit a high-risk diverse cohort of children from
early through mid-puberty (age range 8 to 14 years, Tanner stage II-IV at enrollment), with normal glucose
tolerance and with prediabetes. We will screen 300 children aiming to retain 200 children longitudinally, perform
in-depth assessments and survey them for the progression to T2D. We will investigate complementary pathways
which, by disrupting the delicate balance between insulin sensitivity and secretion, are most likely to modulate
the risk of progression to T2D in youth. To that end, we will 1) characterize the evolution of β-cell dysfunction in
relation to changes in adiposity, sex steroids and growth factors during the pubertal transition. We will combine
clinical phenotypes with physiologic measures of glucose tolerance, β-cell function and insulin sensitivity (derived
from serial oral glucose tolerance tests), circulating metabolites, body composition and abdominal fat changes
(dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging); 2) employ novel epigenetic markers of
DNA methylation at correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIVs) to evaluate epigenetic
changes that may predispose to β-cell dysfunction; and 3) evaluate social and behavioral determinants of health
that could lead to long-term disease phenotype through promotion of adiposity and activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (as measured by urinary catecholamines and cortisol), and inflammation
pathways. Our innovative study design will allow us to determine the evolution of the risk factors for youth-onset
T2D during the pubertal transition, the underlying metabolic changes, and the modifying social and
environmental effects, in the context of genetic/epigenetic susceptibility. The findings from this study are highly
significant to improve the identification of high-risk children vulnerable to progression to T2D, and characterize
the pathophysiology of the disease during a critical window of childhood growth and development. The
knowledge gained will allow the consortium to develop risk stratification algorithms and design personalized
precision interventions, to prevent youth-onset T2D."
10756157,"Schistosomes infect 200 million of the world’s poorest people. Although these parasites kill
250,000 people annually, and rob millions more the ability to lead healthy and productive
lives, treatment of schistosome infection relies on a single drug (Praziquantel). Unfortunately,
Praziquantel is not a magic bullet. Indeed, praziquantel is not equally effective against all
intramammalian stages of the parasite’s life cycle and it suffers from a variable cure rate in
some endemic settings. This later point, raises the specter that praziquantel-resistant
parasites could emerge as organizations ramp up mass drug administration programs.
Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that strains with reduced sensitivity to
praziquantel can be rapidly selected in the laboratory. Therefore, efforts to develop the next
generation of antischistosome therapies to replace praziquantel are key to a sustained effort
to eradicate this disease. Drug development efforts against schistosomes suffer from two
important limitations. First, the large size of the adult parasites (~1cm in length) makes
screening thousands of compounds for activity against the worm impractical. The second
important limitation is that we only know the function of a small number of proteins in these
worms making it challenging conduct informed target-based drug discovery efforts. To
address these issues, we have conducted the first large-scale loss-of-function RNA
interference (RNAi) screen in adult schistosomes. Using this platform, we have performed
over 2000 individual RNAi knockdown experiments in adult Schistosoma mansoni and
identified nearly two hundred genes, a large fraction of which are potentially druggable, that
are essential for parasite survival and/or neuromuscular function both in vitro and in vivo
inside mice. To capitalize on these studies we will execute three specific aims to discover
and experimentally prioritize druggable targets in the schistosome. In Specific Aim 1, we will
utilize RNAi and in silico approaches to identify and prioritize druggable targets that are
essential in vitro and in vivo in three medically relevant schistosome species. In Specific Aim
2, we will experimentally validate the druggability of the highest priority targets from Aim 1 by
assessing the performance of these targets in small-scale high throughput small molecule
screens. These studies will identify both validated druggable targets in the schistosome that
can form the basis of future drug discovery campaigns and compounds poised for lead
optimization efforts."
10794336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV and methamphetamine (MA) use are global health problems with devastating human and societal
consequences. HIV and methamphetamine use also produce independent and additive impairments in
neurocognition, and current clinical and basic science research suggest complex and currently inadequately
understood interactions between HIV and MA pathophysiologies. We therefore propose to conduct
comprehensive characterization, at the single cell/nuclear level, of human brain tissue and regionally specified
organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. For these single nuclear (sn)RNA-seq and
snATAC-seq analyses, we will sample 3 brain regions (prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and basolateral
amygdala) critical for the neurobiological response to MA use in 20 brains from each of two donor groups,
HIV+MA+ and HIV-MA+. These data generation efforts will complement ongoing efforts in these same brain
regions from HIV-MA- and HIV+MA- donors and allow us to elucidate differences in gene expression and key
biological pathways that occur in response to MA use, HIV, or the combination of the two. In addition, we will
assay brain cell types for HIV transcripts, allowing us to identify cellular reservoirs of HIV in donor brains.
These efforts will be aided by the use of human cortical organoid and medial ganglionic eminence organoid
cultures, which offer complex, region-matched model systems recapitulating in vivo-like cellular diversity and
microenvironments without potentially confounding factors including patient history, varying co-morbidities,
prolonged postmortem intervals, or tissue degradation. We will then apply cutting edge and novel data analysis
pipelines to integrate snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data and identify cell population and gene expression
differences between cell clusters (i.e., putative cell types) in different conditions. These data will also be
integrated with external datasets from the SCORCH Consortium and other multi-omic data including genotype,
RNA-seq, HiC, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq data from both healthy subjects and subjects with HIV infection,
neurological disease, or a history of drug abuse. Finally, we will use multiplexed immunohistochemistry and
single molecular fluorescent in situ hybridization to validate the cell type specific expression and co-expression
of candidate genes, biological processes, and gene regulatory networks implicated in the etiology of HIV or MA
pathophysiology. All data generation protocols and data analysis tools will be made freely available to the
research community, and all data generated will be provided as both raw and processed resources. Taken
together, the proposed experiments will generate invaluable resources and offer new biological insights into
the human brain and its disorders."
10800712,"Abstract
 Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to
remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this
procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence
of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential
pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular
cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an
important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our
team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial
and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint
degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in
the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is
unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before
and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall
hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the
joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are
combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined
clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.
 Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and
composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients
with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after
surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue
metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry.
Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage
degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors,
biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of
cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment
approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as
physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration."
10769865,"Project Summary: Continuous Evolution of Proteins with Novel Therapeutic Potential
 The direct manipulation of genes and gene products in vivo has enormous therapeutic potential, and many
strategies to achieve these goals are swiftly advancing toward clinical use. Proteins that can manipulate DNA,
RNA, and proteins in living cells, including genome editing technologies that enable the precise correction of
disease-causing mutations in vivo, have exemplified the promise of such approaches both for research and
therapeutic applications. While many of these approaches have shown promise in initial research studies,
proteins often require extensive development and tailoring to acquire the activity, specificity, and stability needed
to serve as impactful research tools or leads for therapeutic development. As new macromolecular therapeutic
modalities continue to be developed at a remarkable rate, methods to generate proteins on a rapid time scale
with tailor-made functions are needed. Ideally such methods will be versatile and can be applied to many
classes of problems in the life sciences.
 Our lab developed phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), a technology to evolve biomolecules ≥100-
fold faster than using conventional laboratory evolution approaches, with minimal required researcher
intervention. We have demonstrated the ability of PACE to evolve many different classes of proteins with new
and altered activities, specificities, and other desirable properties such as soluble expression in E. coli. Proteins
evolved using PACE have shown broad utility in multiple non-bacterial settings, including genome editing agents
that have been applied to rescue human cell and animal models of genetic diseases, and insecticidal proteins
that kill agricultural pests. These developments establish PACE as a broadly applicable and highly enabling
technology for generating therapeutically and biotechnologically relevant proteins.
 We propose to apply PACE to evolve novel proteins with therapeutic potential, or that enable new
technologies for therapeutics discovery. These proteins include next-generation precision genome editing
agents that can be more easily delivered in vivo or are more efficient and clinically relevant; self-delivering
proteases that cleave endogenous protein targets implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and brain cancer;
and small molecule-binding proteins that enable drug-induced target protein degradation. Success would
provide a foundation for innovative therapeutic strategies to correct mutations that cause human genetic
diseases, and to reprogram self-delivering proteases as catalytic drugs to treat brain diseases. In addition, by
creating drug-sensitive alleles that allow a protein of interest to be degraded in a small molecule-dependent
manner, the proposed research would establish powerful new functional genomics tools to reveal biological
functions and validate therapeutics targets. Collectively, the proposed research integrates powerful protein
evolution technologies with enzymes that precisely manipulate genomes and proteomes to advance
therapeutics science."
10588187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, with over 223,000 infections, almost
13,000 deaths, and 1 billion dollars in healthcare cost in the United States every year. C. difficile infection starts
when infectious spores are ingested and germinate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to produce the vegetative
cells that cause the disease. In order to establish an infection, C. difficile must colonize the human colon,
however, the factors that allow C. difficile to successfully colonize the intestine remain largely unknown.
Hydrolytic enzymes such as collagenases and gelatinases have been known to help multiple pathogens to
colonize distinct niches within the human body by facilitating penetration into host tissues, contributing to the
dissemination of toxins, and increasing the availability of nutrients for the pathogen to use. These enzymes allow
the degradation of collagen and its derivative gelatin, which are ubiquitous components of mammalian tissues
(including gastrointestinal tissue). I hypothesize that the collagenase enzymes in C. difficile are colonization
factors that allow this bacterium to degrade host collagen and gelatin, and that these hydrolytic
activities improve C. difficile intestinal colonization and persistence in the gut to increase virulence. The
overall objective of this application is to identify what enzyme(s) are responsible for the collagenolytic and
gelatinolytic activities observed in C. difficile strains, and how these activities impact pathogenesis and the host.
To test this hypothesis, and in pursuit of the overall goal, I am determined to complete the following Specific
Aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of U32 peptidases CD0703 and CD1228 in collagen and gelatin degradation.
Aim 2. Examine the role of the collagenase/gelatinase in C. difficile pathogenesis and colonization of
the host intestine. The completion of these aims will identify the enzyme(s) responsible for the hydrolytic activities
observed in C. difficile and determine the contribution of these hydrolytic activities during C. difficile infection.
Elucidating these could provide novel targets for prevention or treatment of C. difficile infection."
10755359,"Efforts to meet the increasing need for kidney transplantation have resulted in more
kidney procurements from older and sicker donors, but have also unfortunately led to
greater discard rates of procured kidneys. Although a subset of these organs are
unsuitable for transplantation, many kidneys are unnecessarily discarded due to the
inability to accurately assess graft quality and predict graft outcomes, often driven by
unfavorable scores on the kidney donor profile index (KDPI), a widely used but
inadequate metric for evaluating the quality of donated kidneys. The objective of the
Deceased Donor Study is to gain insight into the biological processes that affect kidney
quality during donor death and organ procurement. Phases 1 and 2 of the study
generated novel insights into donor pathophysiology and revealed limitations in organ
quality assessment, which motivate this renewal application. After evaluating >30 urine
biomarkers collected from >1,500 donors, a protective effect for increasing donor
urinary levels of repair biomarkers (e.g., YKL-40, uromodulin, and osteopontin), on long-
term graft function in >2,500 recipients was demonstrated. In phase 3, these urinary
repair biomarker results will begin to be validated and implemented in organ allocation
process using real-time point-of-care tests. In collaboration with organ procurement
organizations, repair biomarkers in samples from 500 donors with acute kidney injury
(AKI) or high-risk KDPIs will be measured prospectively on site. Additional racial
diversity will be included in our cohort in collaboration with the multicenter APOL1 Long-
term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network to assess the differential response in
recipient allograft outcomes to the APOL1 genotype more commonly present in Black
donors. Lastly, in collaboration with the United Network for Organ Sharing laboratory,
“adjusted” KDPIs will be provided for donors with AKI based on creatinine trajectory,
genetic risk variants, and biomarker information, with the aim of improving kidney
acceptability. These new tools may also provide a platform for enhancing understanding
of the natural history of deceased-donor kidney transplantation, advancing the science
of renal injury and repair as it relates to donor race, and determining the best
approaches for transplanting kidneys at risk for discard."
10754286,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
This is a revised version of a new R01 grant that characterizes stable epigenetic changes that are induced in
mouse limbic brain regions in response to early life stress (ELS) which then increase an individual's
susceptibility to subsequent stress for a lifetime. This work has been supported over the past ten years by an
NIMH Conte Center, however, that Center has now “sun-setted”—it cannot be renewed—hence, this new
proposal to continue this original line of research. Our innovative hypothesis is that ELS induces stable
“chromatin scars” that drive long-lived changes in gene expression, which then mediate downstream changes
in cell and circuit function and ultimately behavioral responses to chronic stress in adulthood. We concentrate
on nucleus accumbens (NAc) based on its central role in brain reward and motivation and on empirical findings
of its central role in controlling stress susceptibility. We utilize open-ended, unbiased proteomic and next-
generation sequencing approaches to first identify the most robust and significant putative chromatin scars in
NAc in a cell-type-specific manner and to then characterize those mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and
behavioral levels. Importantly, we investigate only those mechanisms that are validated in postmortem NAc of
depressed humans. One major focus is H3K79me2 (dimethylation of Lys79 of histone H3), the induction of
which is the most significant histone modification caused by ELS in NAc of both male and female mice. The
methyltransferase (DOT1L) and demethylase (KDM2B) that control H3K79me2 are both induced in NAc by
ELS, effects specific to D2-type medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Bidirectional viral-mediated manipulation of
DOT1L or KDM2B selectively in D2 NAc MSNs of male and female mice establishes the role played by these
enzymes in mediating the ability of ELS to increase stress susceptibility based on rapid behavioral screening
assays. We will now extend measures of stress susceptibility to numerous, more sophisticated behavioral
procedures with greater translational potential, and test the ability of a DOT1L inhibitor, now in clinical trials for
certain cancers, to reverse ELS-induced stress susceptibility upon systemic administration, further promoting
the translational potential of the proposed research. As well, we have shown by RNAseq that DOT1L
overexpression in D2 MSNs mimics a large portion of gene expression changes induced by ELS in this cell
type, while DOT1L knockdown blocks ELS action. We will now map H3K79me2 enrichment genome-wide in
D2 MSNs by CUT&RUNseq to identify networks of genes whose altered expression by ELS is mediated by this
histone mark. We will also generate more complete open-ended proteomic and transcriptomic datasets and
characterize additional putative chromatin scars induced in NAc by ELS. Substantial preliminary data, for
example, implicate H3K27me1 as a prominent chromatin scare that predominates in D1 MSNs of male mice
only. Together, this work will characterize novel mechanisms that drive a persisting state of enhanced stress
susceptibility and offer insight into new ways of reversing such susceptibility in adulthood."
10770524,"SUMMARY: Current anti-VEGF-A therapies inhibit choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a subset of patients
with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NV-AMD). However, long-term treatment with such anti-
VEGF-A therapies may impair physiological functions of the choriocapillaris and retina for which VEGF-A is
needed. Moreover, disease progression can occur despite continuous anti-VEGF-A treatment. Thus, novel
therapies for NV-AMD are urgently needed that target specifically disease-associated mechanisms without
impairing growth factors and cellular pathways that are required for homeostatic functions of the retina and
choroid. Inhibiting the inflammatory pathways that promote CNV would be such a promising novel approach that
would not interfere with the normal functions of healthy retinal and choroidal cells. In this context, the
inflammasome, a proinflammatory protein complex that promotes pathologic angiogenesis through the
generation of IL-1b and which has been reported to be activated in AMD, has become an area of much interest
in the AMD field. However, previous studies have focused mainly on the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells and
conflicting data have resulted in an unclear picture of the role of the inflammasome for AMD pathogenesis. By
utilizing a genetic mouse model of NV-AMD, Vegfahyper mice, we provide now new data that resolve key open
questions in the AMD field and help explain some of the conflicting data. Our findings demonstrate that
inflammasome activation in activated macrophages and microglia but not in RPE cells promotes CNV. Thus, a
lack of inflammasome activity in the RPE does not mean that the inflammasome does not play a role in AMD
pathogenesis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that inflammasome activation can occur in CNV macrophages
and microglia despite NLRP3 deficiency. Based on these findings we propose that activation of both NLRP3
inflammasomes as well as non-NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophages/microglia promotes CNV. Our new data
in Vegfahyper mice and in eyes from patients with NV-AMD suggest that the AIM2 inflammasome is a key
contributor to overall inflammasome activation in these macrophages and/or microglia. Thus, we hypothesize
that both the NLRP3 and the AIM2 inflammasomes promote NV-AMD through their activation in macrophages
and microglia that infiltrate and induce early CNV. Notably, a role of the AIM2 inflammasome for AMD
pathogenesis has previously not been considered. Thus, our preliminary data and published work provide a
strong scientific premise for these hypotheses, and the proposed experiments have a high novelty, high
rigor, and strong clinical relevance, as their outcome will serve as a framework for novel therapies that target
inflammasome activation in patients with NV-AMD. Our proposal will utilize both genetic as well as pharmacologic
approaches in two well-established mouse models of NV-AMD as well as experiments in human AMD eyes, to
define the roles of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes for NV-AMD."
10755364,"Emotional dysregulation constitutes a serious public health problem and novel approaches are needed to
effectively address it transdiagnostically. Despite rapid advancements in affective and cognitive neuroscience,
there have been few attempts to translate basic findings into novel interventions. In addition, the relevance of
different nodes in the emotion regulation network to psychopathology and to successful reduction of emotional
arousal is not yet fully understood. Noninvasive neurostimulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS), is a powerful tool with which dysfunction can be alleviated temporarily, by modulating
neural activation. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to examine immediate neural and behavioral
changes following neuromodulation enhanced emotion regulation training for transdiagnostic adults who report
difficulties calming down when upset. The central hypothesis is that neurostimulation enhances the
acquisition of emotion regulation skills and leads to remediated neural function in the emotion regulation
network. Our long-term goal is to develop novel interventions that harness neuroscientific findings to advance
behavioral treatments.
The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the unique neural and behavioral effects of a one-session training
combining cognitive restructuring (CR), an emotion regulation skill, with excitatory rTMS over the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The secondary aim is to identify key changes in the emotion regulation neural
network following the combined intervention versus each of the components alone. The third aim is to explore
personalized biomarkers for response to emotion regulation training. To achieve these aims, 240 rTMS naïve,
community adults who meet criteria for affective or stress DSM-5 disorders (excluding if co-occurring anorexia,
alcohol and substance use, bipolar I, or psychotic disorders) and who self-report high emotional dysregulation
and low use of CR will participate in brain imaging while undergoing an emotional regulation task. Participants
will be randomly assigned to CR training (groups 1 & 2) or to psychoeducation about emotions (group 3; aimed
to control for nonspecific factors). Participants will be reminded of recent stressors and will undergo real
(groups 1 & 3) or sham (group 2) high frequency rTMS, targeted using fMRI results. Participants who learned
CR will practice this skill during rTMS in a one-time session, and physiological arousal will be monitored
throughout the emotion induction and regulation practice. Following this training, participants will undergo
another functional scan and an exit interview to assess for immediate neural and behavioral changes. Bio-
behavioral measures of emotion regulation will be assessed at a one week and a one month follow up visit. If
successful, our line of research will provide key mechanistic information to develop a novel transdiagnostic
treatment for affective and stress disorders."
10731758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infectious insults are common during pregnancy; over the nine months of gestation ~60% of pregnant women
self-report at least one illness, with viral upper respiratory tract (URT) infections being the most common.
Although URT-trophic viruses replicate in the respiratory epithelium, the induced inflammatory cytokines like
type I interferon (IFN) circulate systemically and can access the placenta. Recent work has shown that virally
induced type I IFNs can be major drivers of adverse effects on fetal development. URT infections during
pregnancy, however, are not typically linked to birth defects or miscarriage. It was therefore unclear why
maternal infection with a pathogen like an influenza virus, which also induces to fetal IFN exposure, would not
compromise fetal health. We hypothesized that an uncharacterized IFN regulatory pathway was the answer to
this apparent discrepancy. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screen, we identified a G-protein
coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) dependent signaling pathway that protected fetal health from type I IFN
signaling during maternal influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Disruption of this pathway led to fetal phenotypes
as severe as those caused by direct congenital infections. Importantly, the activities of this pathway were
restricted to reproductive and fetal tissues; alterations of its activity had no measurable effect on maternal
health during IAV infection. The major goal of this application is to understand how GPER1-mediated signaling
normally protects fetal health from inflammatory maternal cytokines such as type I IFN. In aim 1, we will define
how GPER1-induced GPCR signaling suppresses IFN-induced JAK/STAT signaling and interferon-stimulated
gene expression. These experiments will define a previously unknown mechanism for control of IFN signaling.
In aim 2, we will characterize where and when GPER1 signaling is required to protect fetal health, as well as
the effects of GPER1 dysregulation on cell physiology both in vivo and in primary human placental organoid
cultures. These experiments will allow basic mechanistic insights into how maternal inflammation compromises
fetal development. Finally, in aim 3, we will explore the consequences of IFN signaling on placental
structure/function when GPER1 is absent and also evaluate the potential of hyper-activating GPER1 signaling
under the inflammatory conditions that normally harm fetal development. Together, these studies will not only
allow for a more complete understanding of IFN regulatory mechanisms and the fetal/maternal immune
response but could also serve as the basis for an eventual first-in-class treatment designed to protect the fetus
from inflammation without compromising maternal immunity."

10763022,"Schizophrenia is a major public health problem associated with core motivational deficits that are amongst the
strongest predictors of impaired functional outcomes. Without motivation, people are unable to maintain their
pursuit of employment or educational goals, engage in treatment, and regularly participate in healthy life
decisions. Current pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia have demonstrated limited
effectiveness for improving this core symptom. Motivation Skills Training (MST) is a novel intervention that
addresses this clinical need. The premise of MST is that knowledge about one’s level and sources of
motivation underlies the ability to regulate (i.e., understand and manage) motivation, and that motivation self-
regulation can in turn facilitate task initiation and persistence. By facilitating goal-directed behavior, MST aims
to enhance daily functioning and goal attainment in people with schizophrenia. MST is unique from existing
interventions in that it directly teaches people about motivation and how to self-regulate motivation,
empowering individuals to become active agents in controlling their own motivation and behavior. Preliminary
work provides a clear conceptual rationale for targeting motivation skills in people with schizophrenia. Pilot
efficacy data support the next phase of intervention testing, to evaluate the effectiveness of MST in a
randomized controlled trial (RCT). This study uses a 2-phase deployment-focused model of intervention testing
to establish the feasibility, acceptability and pilot effectiveness of MST for adults ages 18-65 with a
schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. An initial open trial of MST in one outpatient clinic (N=10) will evaluate
target engagement and yield valued stakeholder input on the acceptability and clinical utility of MST content
and format, informing refinements to the treatment manual. A subsequent RCT (N=80) conducted at four
outpatient clinics will test the effectiveness of MST versus a Healthy Behaviors Control (HBC) group, both
conducted in the context of routine recovery-oriented services. Clinic staff will be trained to provide MST and
HBC in weekly groups over approximately 12 weeks. We will test the hypothesis that MST is superior to HBC
for improving motivation, goal attainment, and quality of life. We will evaluate change in motivation as the
mechanism through which functional outcomes improve from baseline to post-treatment and 2-month follow-
up. We will explore the generalizability of MST effects by expanding outcome measures to include changes in
executive functioning, clinically rated community functioning and psychiatric symptom severity. This study will
provide the preliminary effectiveness data as well as data on the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, randomizing,
and retaining participants to guide the design of a larger fully powered trial. If teaching people with
schizophrenia the knowledge and skills needed to self-regulate motivation improves volitional behavior, MST
will have the potential to have a widespread impact on improving the lives of people with schizophrenia."
10799665,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genetic variation influences drug response phenotypes and is a pillar of precision
medicine — choosing the right drug for the right patient at the right dose and time. A public resource of
pharmacogenomics knowledge is critical — both to catalyze basic discovery of the molecular mechanisms that drive
variability in drug response and to support the implementation of clinical research to understand how to best deliver
pharmacogenomics in the clinic. The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) is the premier public repository of
pharmacogenomics knowledge. PharmGKB curators focus on high quality extraction and representation of knowledge in
the primary literature, and capture information about individual genetic variations that impact drug response, the potential
clinical impact of these variations, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of drug response, the
pharmacogenomic requirements in regulatory documents (labels), and guidelines for genome-driven prescribing. The
PharmGKB website hosts annually on average 5.2 million webpage views (without bots) and provides flexible access to
pharmacogenomics knowledge on multiple devices. Most importantly, PharmGKB serves as a hub for the research
community in pharmacogenomics and precision medicine — integrating its contents with critical resources and
organizations including ClinVar, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), the FDA, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics
Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and others. In this proposal, we request support for PharmGKB as a Biomedical
Knowledgebase, and outline a plan to (1) annotate, aggregate, integrate, and disseminate pharmacogenomic knowledge
from sources utilizing community curation and semi-automated methods to assist knowledge acquisition, (2) build
curation and user-specific interfaces that catalyze the discovery and use of pharmacogenomic knowledge, providing the
content of our knowledgebase in novel ways that are useful to our users, (3) collaborate and integrate with ongoing
national and international efforts dedicated to the implementation of genomic medicine by providing the best scientific
knowledge to support these important programs and (4) develop a new long-term and conceptual framework for broadly
integrating available PGx knowledgebases into genomic medicine."

There is a critical need for investigators to have ready access to a dedicated resource to evaluate new
regenerative medicine and gene therapy/somatic cell genome editing applications with nonhuman primates for
the treatment of human diseases. This application is focused on meeting this need through the improvement
and validation of the rhesus monkey model and related tools and technologies to address new approaches to
treat inherited disorders that impact a range of organ systems; and by providing investigators with opportunities
to obtain data for new NIH grant applications and for the conduct of investigational new drug (IND)-enabling
studies. The potential ramifications of gene transfer/genome editing at any age underscores the importance of
rigorous assessments of safety in the rhesus monkey model system which closely recapitulates human
physiology. The proposed resource program will be of significant interest to investigators and a range of NIH
Institutes as the opportunities will cut across a spectrum of organ systems and diseases. The goals will be
accomplished through the following Specific Aims: (1) Enhance tools and technologies for translational gene-
based approaches in the rhesus monkey model for utilization by the research community; (2) Improve
preclinical xenogeneic models for use by the research community to study human hematopoietic cells in the

Therapy/Somatic Cell Genome Editing Resource Program for model validation and therapeutic testing. Our
translational team will meet the goals of the RFA by improving and validating the monkey model system for
translational research across the lifespan; enhancing biological resources, tools, technologies, and research
protocols; and utilizing an established and proven infrastructure that has a successful track record in providing
collaborative research opportunities to investigators nationwide. To ensure accessibility for investigators, a call
for validation studies will be circulated to launch the resource. The program will provide a pipeline for
preclinical and IND-enabling investigations for the development and testing of new treatments for a range of
common and rare diseases."
10760334,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, there are few therapies that
are effective in treating this malignant disease. With less than 10% of patients who have HCC surviving beyond
5 years, it is important to identify additional therapeutic vulnerabilities. Metabolic alterations are a key feature of
HCC pathogenesis, and represent targets that may reveal liabilities in HCC. Glucose-6-Phosphatase (G6PC) is
recurrently downregulated in HCC and the magnitude of this downregulation correlates with patient outcome.
Sequencing studies of HCCs reveal that somatic mutations occur in a subset of these malignancies. Additional
evidence for G6PC involvement in HCC comes from Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1a (GSD1a), where
germline mutations in G6PC lead to benign and malignant forms of liver cancer without cirrhosis. The functional
relevance of recurrent mutations in G6PC or loss of G6PC expression to HCC pathogenesis in unclear. I
hypothesize that loss of G6PC stimulates anabolic metabolic pathways required for tumor cell growth and are
sufficient to drive hepatocyte proliferation and tumor initiation. The Specific Aims of this proposal aim to (1)
determine how loss of G6PC alters metabolism to support tumor growth, (2) test whether G6PC can increase
proliferation, and (3) explore ways in which G6PC loss influences liver tumors initiation and progression in mouse
HCC models. We will use G6PC deficient in vitro and in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate aspects of GSD1a
biology in patients, and stable isotope tracing to dissect how loss of G6PC rewires metabolic pathways.
Altogether, these Aims will elucidate how G6PC loss influences non-cirrhotic development of HCC, and will
provide insight into Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1a. We hope to identify metabolic liabilities in HCC
pathogenesis that may provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease."
10762989,"Project Summary
Although effective therapies exist in many cancers, an initial response to therapy is often followed by relapse.
An extreme example is multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy in the bone marrow, which responds to
treatment in almost all patients, but which cannot be cured. Myeloma patients therefore receive many different
lines of therapy during the course of their disease. Repeated bone marrow biopsies are crucial for monitoring
of treatment response and for informing the optimal choice of treatment and are therefore currently
recommended with any change in treatment. However, the excessive number of biopsies over time creates an
enormous burden for patients, and these tissue biopsies are often not performed beyond initial diagnosis. In
addition, bone marrow biopsies only capture myeloma cells from a single site, and therefore do not provide a
complete representation of the heterogeneity and ongoing evolution of this multifocal disease that is
characterized by patchy bone marrow involvement. It is therefore imperative to develop novel approaches that
allow to frequently assess myeloma evolution during therapy and choose those treatments that are most
efficacious. We are proposing to use novel “liquid biopsy” approaches to replace bone marrow biopsy by
interrogating circulating myeloma cells and cell-free DNA in myeloma patients, obtained from a simple blood
draw. We hypothesize that liquid biopsy provides more comprehensive and clinically relevant insights into the
molecular dynamics and genomic evolution of myeloma than can be obtained through single-site bone marrow
biopsies. To accomplish this task, we have pioneered technologies for highly sensitive isolation and deep
molecular and genomic characterization of circulating multiple myeloma cells (CMMCs) with single cell
resolution, as well as whole genome and targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). We will leverage these
technologies to inform clinical decision-making in a way that is impossible with the current practice of using
bone marrow biopsies as standard-of-care. Specifically, we will demonstrate that: 1) Liquid biopsy is a better
predictor of survival than parameters currently used in clinical routine, 2) Liquid biopsy has greater sensitivity
and specificity to detect established prognostic and predictive genetic disease variants than bone marrow
biopsy, the current gold-standard, 3) Liquid biopsy provides a therapeutically more relevant representation of
the clonal composition and actionable treatment targets of myeloma than bone marrow biopsy, 4) Liquid biopsy
outperforms bone marrow biopsy in determining minimal residual disease (MRD) status. Importantly, replacing
repeated invasive biopsies with liquid biopsy from a simple blood draw will dramatically reduce risk and
discomfort for patients. We expect that the concepts we are investigating will be practice-changing for the care
of myeloma patients and will be broadly relevant across many different cancers and produce important new
opportunities for therapies."
10755686,"Anxiety disorders are the most common form of pediatric psychiatric illness, affecting up to 30% and severely
impairing up to 20% of all youth prior to age 18. Unfortunately, up to 50% of children remain symptomatic even
with best available treatments, making anxiety disorders a major public health problem. To devise new
treatments for anxiety disorders, more research is needed into underlying brain mechanisms. Research
studying mechanisms suggests that anxiety disorders are linked to alterations in attention, including increased
attention to threatening stimuli (e.g., feared objects or sounds). However, more recent research suggests these
attention alterations may be due to a larger problem in which attention is increased to all stimuli (e.g., any loud
noise, flash of light, etc.). This alteration in attention seems to be the opposite of ADHD, the prototypical
disorder of attention in childhood and also a common childhood psychiatric disorder. In ADHD, children appear
to have a generalized decrease in attention to suddenly appearing stimuli (e.g., children with ADHD might not
hear their name called). Intriguingly, although anxiety and ADHD appear to demonstrate opposing attention-
related problems, these disorders occur in the same child more often than expected by chance. Understanding
the brain mechanisms underlying attention alterations in pediatric anxiety and ADHD is critical in designing
new treatments that attempt to target or ‘correct’ problems in these brain mechanisms. In this study, we test
the hypothesis that attention-related brain circuitry is overactive in anxiety disorders such that bright objects
and errors elicit increased activity compared to children with no disorder. We further predict this circuitry is
underactive in ADHD such that bright objects and errors elicit diminished activity increases. We hypothesize
that children with both anxiety and ADHD have an intermediate level of activity (similar to children with no
disorder), though less is known in this area. Finally, we predict that peer observation (a mild threat/stressor)
further exacerbates the overly active attention-related brain circuitry in children with anxiety. To test these
hypotheses, we use cutting-edge neuroscience tools to provide a nuanced characterization of attention-related
brain circuitry in N=300 children ages 10-12 years with anxiety disorders (n=75), ADHD (n=75), both anxiety
and ADHD (n=75), and no psychiatric disorder (n=75). Children play a computer game during which we
measure how suddenly appearing objects capture their attention. Brain activity is measured using functional
MRI, pinpointing the specific brain locations that are disrupted; and electroencephalography (EEG), providing
precise timing information. We characterize attention-related brain circuitry when children are being observed
by a peer versus without this stressor. This study will provide a comprehensive description of circuit-level
mechanisms of altered attention in pediatric anxiety, ADHD, and co-morbid conditions, providing mechanistic
targets for novel treatment design. Results could ultimately have major public health impact, by assisting in the
design of new treatments for two of the most prevalent and impairing childhood psychiatric disorders."
10749930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of this research is to improve adult outcomes for people with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Adolescents and young adults with ASD tend to have worse outcomes, with respect to employment,
education, and quality of life, than neurotypical peers. These outcomes include under-enrollment into college,
unemployment, and limited functional independence. Research-informed transition planning that addresses
core impairments in skills related to adult autonomy, including self-knowledge, self-determination, and self-
regulation, may improve outcomes for this growing population. In prior research, we developed a stakeholder-
involved transition program (STEPS: Stepped Transition in Education Program for Students with ASD) and
found it to be feasible, acceptable, and efficacious. Data from a small randomized controlled trial (RCT)
focusing on feasibility indicated that it was acceptable to participants and suggested STEPS was effective in
improving readiness for transition to adulthood. We will now test the effectiveness of STEPS, and engagement
of target mechanisms, in partnership with four community agencies. This study is designed as a Hybrid Type 1,
which focuses primarily on intervention effectiveness with a secondary focus on factors related to
implementation. We assess the immediate (post-treatment) and longer-term (six month follow-up) clinical
outcomes of adult functional outcomes and vocational engagement. We will also determine the degree to
which STEPS leads to change in the theoretical mediating mechanisms (i.e., adult autonomy skills) and
formally test mediation (i.e., the degree to which change in adult autonomy skills leads to change in adult
functional outcomes). From the providers, we will seek qualitative information on implementation such as
thoughts on STEPS’ cultural sensitivity, and quantitative data on the appropriateness, feasibility, and
acceptability of STEPS. We also track providers’ sustained use of STEPS with their clients in the six months
after study enrollment has ended. This research will produce findings that have the potential to shift clinical
practice related to transition to adulthood for people with ASD. In light of the fact that approximately 70,000
people with ASD age into adulthood every year and the economic burden associated with ASD, the potential
public health impact of this research is considerable."

Andrew Heitzer, PhD, is an Assistant Member in the Psychology and Biobehavioral Sciences Department at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is the development of Dr. Heitzer into an independent investigator focused on implementing behavioral interventions to improve neurocognitive and academic outcomes in patients diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD). Dr. Heitzer has organized a mentorship team with distinguished records of NIH funding who are committed to advancing his career. Mentors have expertise in dissemination and implementation science, intervention adaptation and development, mixed-methods research, and conduct of behavioral clinical trials in SCD. SCD is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin characterized by early and progressive neurocognitive dysfunction affecting 100,000 individuals in the United States. Pervasive neurocognitive difficulties significantly contribute to poor academic performance in mathematics, reading, and writing. A critical gap exists in developing evidence-based interventions to address the substantial functional consequences of cognitive deficits in SCD. Attempts to address neurocognitive deficits in SCD through behavioral approaches have struggled with adherence, limiting their effectiveness. Addressing barriers to adherence and increasing accessibility is critical to intervention success. This is particularly true for patients with SCD, who are predominately racial minorities from underserved communities. These families are less likely to report developmental concerns, experience more significant stigma for seeking help, and underutilize early intervention services for children with developmental delays. Behavioral interventions early in life can potentially prevent later neurodevelopmental and academic deficits. Specifically, interventions that target school readiness skills, including early literacy, numeracy, and self-regulation, produce lasting improvements in attention, working memory, and academic performance. Although several evidence-based school readiness interventions exist, they have not considered the contextual factors unique to patients with SCD. The specific aims are: 1) Adapt a behavioral intervention to improve school readiness for preschoolers with SCD; 2) Conduct a pilot trial of the adapted school readiness intervention compared to routine care to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. This will be the first study to adapt and test an intervention approach fitted for patients with SCD, facilitating the development of targeted interventions with great potential for improving the quality of life for all children living with SCD. Data collected from the pilot trial will provide the foundation to apply for an R01-funded study to test the intervention’s efficacy facilitated by an ongoing multi-site longitudinal cohort study led by St. Jude."

the respiratory health risks of e-cig use, we propose an ancillary study to R01ES029967 (6th percentile, Fall
2019) to evaluate associations between e-cig use and subclinical lung injury, as well as the potential
contribution of metals contained in e-cig aerosols. Risk of inhaling metals via e-cigs is poorly understood,
although at least one EVALI case was linked to cobalt in a vape pen. Our team has shown that e-cig aerosols
frequently contain potentially toxic levels of metals with established links to lung disease. Hence, we propose
to study e-cig users for evidence of subclinical lung disease in the context of state-of-the-science
metal measurements. Subclinical lung disease can be detected and characterized using quantitative imaging
measures of lung structure and function that have been pioneered by our investigative group. We have shown
that lung features on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predict incident
clinical lung disease. We have also found that these imaging measures may detect e-cig and metal-related
subclinical lung injury. This study will use imaging measures of subclinical lung disease to support
inferences regarding the long-term clinical respiratory risks of e-cig use and e-cig-related metal
exposure. Parent study R01ES029967 will examine the relationships between e-cig use, metals, and
subclinical cardiovascular disease by recruiting 520 participants in New York City, ages 18-50 years old,
including 130 current e-cig users (vapers) who never smoked tobacco, 130 current vapers/former smokers,
130 dual current vapers/current smokers, and 130 never vapers/never smokers. Measurements will include
gold-standard quantification of metals in e-cig aerosols as well as in blood or urine, in addition to detailed
assessments of endothelial health and preclinical cardiovascular disease. With this ancillary study, we
propose to add innovative ultra-low dose CT (N=400 participants) and cardiopulmonary MRI (N=200
participants) – plus spirometry, DLCO, and relevant confounders – to test the following Aims:
Aim 1: Determine the associations of e-cig use with imaging measures of subclinical lung disease.
Aim 2: Determine the associations of metal exposures with imaging measures of subclinical lung disease.
Exploratory Aim 3: Explore effect modification and mediation of Aim 1 associations by metal exposures.
This study will address major gaps in knowledge regarding the respiratory health risks of e-cig use, which is
increasingly common in young adults. It will test robust biological hypotheses regarding e-cigs and subclinical
lung disease using innovative imaging measures developed and applied by the investigative team; moreover, it
will examine the role of metal exposure, an established pulmonary toxin, in e-cig-related lung injury. The
results will be suitable to help inform public health campaigns and regulation regarding e-cigarettes."
10792958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid overdose is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated mortality with most of these events occurring
through the 12 months after delivery rather than the 9 months before delivery. Historically, the bulk of research
on opioid use disorder (OUD) in this population has focused on pregnancy rather than postpartum. The ‘Fourth
Trimester’ carries significant unique stressors, and women with OUD are especially vulnerable given the addi-
tional stressors they face specific to addiction. Comprehensive treatment during pregnancy includes medica-
tion for OUD (MOUD) with wrap-around services such as behavioral health and prenatal care. However, post-
partum OUD treatment continuation rates are poor, opioid-related deaths increase, and even for women on
MOUD within the month of delivery, postpartum overdose risk is not diminished. We urgently need evidence to
guide how to improve not only postpartum OUD treatment continuation but also its effectiveness at strengthen-
ing recovery, operationalized as abstinence or decreased substance use with improved quality of life. A novel
approach to address this critical knowledge gap is to assess a woman’s multidimensional profile (‘phenotype’)
at the pregnancy to postpartum transition then use that information to tailor her treatment regimen (e.g., dosing
of buprenorphine, addition of other medications, targeted behavioral therapies) going forward after delivery.
Multidimensional (‘phenotypic’) variables that determine one’s profile include biological, neurobehavioral and
psychosocial factors. This strategy is in line with our current understanding of addiction having a neurobiologi-
cal basis modified by one’s psychosocial context that can vary over the lifecourse. The proposed research has
three aims: (1) Obtain qualitative data from women on MOUD and providers in perinatal addiction on chal-
lenges and promoters of recovery specific to the postpartum period, (2) Use this data to systematically revise a
battery developed by NIDA in collaboration with the VCU Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies to tailor it for
women in the postpartum transition and to be feasible in a busy clinical environment, (3) Assess correlations
between multidimensional variables, treatment and recovery outcomes through 12 months after delivery. The
data from this innovative study will inform a clinical trial of an individualized treatment regimen for postpartum
women on MOUD. This project focuses on two high priority areas to NIDA –personalization of addiction treat-
ments and OUD through the perinatal period. The PI, Dr. Martin, is an Early-Career Investigator, obstetrician-
gynecologist and addiction medicine physician. This career development award will fill gaps in her training nec-
essary for her transition to independence in addictions research (in line with Notice of Special Interest NOT-
DA-20-037). Specifically, Dr. Martin will advance her knowledge and skills in clinical trials, mixed methods re-
search, addiction therapeutics, neurobehavioral science, advanced statistical analyses, professional develop-
ment as well as the responsible and ethical conduct of research. She will work closely with a mentorship team
and consultants with expertise across these specialties to carry out her career objectives and research aims."

The revised South African Research Ethics Training Initiative IV (SARETI IV) Masters in Social Science (Health
Research Ethics) program, based at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, will foster advanced African capacity for
the ethics review and implementation of health research, with a special focus on strengthening legal capacity on
research ethics committees (RECs). Health research on the continent has increased exponentially alongside a
complex and evolving legal framework. However, curricula in Africa have not focused on the core legal framework
governing health research ethics nor related ancillary and novel legal issues. Ethics guidelines in several African
countries require a legal member on RECs – yet few are capacitated to meet the expansive demands of this
role. These gaps will be addressed in SARETI IV through focused law modules within a multi-disciplinary Masters
degree with funding for 20–25 students over the 5-year period. Additional self-funded students will enroll for
modules or degrees.
This holistic training program comprises: (1) face-to-face modular coursework; (2) practical work with local RECs,
and leading NIH-funded organizations (the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa
(CAPRISA) and the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC)); (3) an expanded research project on a health
research ethics topic relevant to the student's home institution or country, leading to publication of a peer-
reviewed paper and supported through the program’s expanded social sciences and empirical bioethics
offerings; (4) participation in skills development workshops focused on critical analysis, writing and presentation
skills; and (5) structured mentoring support through individual coaching, a virtual mentorship community and
peer support.
Students will complete an annual capstone assessment to evaluate their assimilation of practical and theoretical
knowledge through a ‘mock’ REC activity. As a leadership incentive, the top student from every academic year
will (1) receive a scholarship to attend the FIC/NIH SARETI PhD-hosted Africa-wide Health Research Ethics
Symposium (AHRES); (2) be appointed as an honorary REC member for a year to advance their review capacity;
and (3) receive additional career coaching.
The SARETI graduates and faculty will contribute to the ethical conduct of appropriate health research and
development in Africa by building REC capacity, training legal REC members, developing social science
expertise for research ethics questions, and by promoting the global development and profile of African research
ethics scholarship."
10802416,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [CFS] is a disabling illness primarily affecting women.
Post exertional malaise [PEM], thought to be the sine qua non of CFS, takes the form of a broad increase in
symptoms occurring sometime after the cessation of often minimal exertion. Capturing and quantifying PEM
remains problematic. Recent reports pointing to a possible metabolic deficit occurring on the second of two
sequential cardiopulmonary exercise tests [CPET] done to exhaustion have attracted a great deal of attention
for two reasons: as a metabolic manifestation of PEM and for use in proving patient disability. Specifically, the
initial reports indicated that CFS patients failed to replicate their metabolic peak VO2 result on the second day
of testing with an earlier onset of the anaerobic threshold defined as the oxygen consumption at the ventilatory
threshold (VO2VT). Subsequent studies did not confirm the inability to replicate the peak VO2 on day #2 but did
confirm the reduction in VO2VT from levels seen on day #1.
However, we identified two problems with the work that has been done on 2-CPET testing: (1) the results are
always presented as aggregate differences from day #1 to day #2 across different patients. Since CFS is
defined clinically, it probably is comprised of multiple subgroups all with the same phenomenology but different
pathophysiological causes. This would mean that only some – but not every – patient would show the
abnormality in VO2VT on day #2 or severe PEM thereafter. (2) Although the researchers claim that this
abnormality is a marker of PEM, there are no data linking patients who show this cardiopulmonary abnormality
to the timing and severity of PEM. The overarching goal of this proposal is to overcome these deficiencies.
A critical still unanswered question is why some CFS patients manifest VO2VT earlier on day #2 of CPET. We
hypothesize that the reason for this is due to reduced total blood volume [TBV] leading to a reduced stroke
volume [SV]. One of our early studies showed reduced SV in a subgroup of severely ill patients; later work
from another group confirmed this finding, also in severely ill patients, and provided evidence to attribute this to
reduced TBV. We hypothesize that exercise on day #1 will lead to insensible fluid loss related to sweating and
deep rapid breathing which will further exacerbate
thatthese changes will
lead
to
decreases
in
reductions in TBV and SV. Accordingly, we hypothesize
VO 2VTon day #2 CPET and that these decreases may be
prevented by fluid expansion. We will evaluate these hypotheses by stratifying CFS on severity of symptoms,
by determining TBV before each CPET, by measuring stroke volume during exercise using an inert gas
rebreathing method, and by replenishing circulating volume intravenously for half the subjects shown to have
reduced blood volume before day #2 testing. Finally we will determine how these changes relate to PEM.
We will study 80 CFS patients [40 in the Severe and 40 in the Non-Severe categories] and compare the data
from them to 40 matched healthy controls to address four aims to answer these research questions."

The primary goal of this training proposal is to understand, with mechanistic granularity, how mu opioid receptors
(MORs) modulate motivated `wanting' versus affective `liking' in nucleus accumbens (NAc). During the proposed
K99 training period, I will be trained in two in vivo physiology/imaging approaches (fiber photometry and 1-photon
microscopy) and on intracellular/molecular effector systems. Additionally, I will actively participate in
professional/career training opportunities and have frequent meetings with my mentoring committee to prepare
to apply and succeed in an independent faculty position. The first research aim of my proposal seeks to
understand the temporal dynamics and effects of endogenous MOR signaling in the DRNEnkNAc pathway. My
previous postdoctoral research, using pharmacology, genetics, and optogenetics/chemogenetics, has identified
the terminals of an enkephalinergic dorsal raphe nucleus projection to NAc as the site of MOR action for
modulating food intake behaviors. To better understand how MOR signaling affects this pathway, I will use two
in vivo imaging approaches, fiber photometry and microendoscopy, to determine how endogenous MOR signals
shape neural circuit activity during motivated behaviors (Aim 1, K99). Additionally, because the roles of specific
intracellular signaling cascades have not been well defined in brain reward circuits, I will manipulate G-protein
and beta-arrestin signaling pathways to determine how each of them contributes to behavior (Aim 2, K99). During
the K99 phase, I will also be preparing to lead my own research lab. I will actively participate in scientific society
leadership positions (chairing symposia, steering committees), learn about how to direct a lab (budgeting and
administrative tasks), and continue to further my scholarly knowledgebase (planned interactions with my mentor
and committee members). For the R00 “independent” phase of my proposal, I propose to build on the mentored
training above to examine what mechanisms and circuits underlie MOR-mediated affective `liking' in NAc (Aim
3). These studies are of interest because growing evidence suggests that though NAc MORs can robustly
modulate both motivation and affect, they likely do so via different neural mechanisms. Understanding how these
biopsychological systems are dissociable, even within a specific neurochemical class, has important implications
for developing novel therapeutic drugs that are efficacious without also having a propensity for abuse. I will
selectively disrupt or restore MOR function using multiple genetic mouse models and viral vector interventions,
as well as record endogenous neuronal responses in vivo using microendoscopic approaches. I will perform
these experiments while testing mice on the affective test reactivity (TR) test, which classifies and quantifies
innate orofacial reactions to taste stimuli and has been used effectively for decades to measure the affective
value of taste stimuli. The knowledge gained from these studies and mentorship opportunities will greatly
facilitate the development of my own research program, preparing me for the next phase of my career."

Interpretation of the clinical significance of somatic variants in cancer remains a major challenge in cancer
diagnosis, prognosis and treatment prediction. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has established
extensive infrastructure including tools, web resources, procedures, and expert panel templates to help
communities of experts establish the clinical relevance of genes and variants. However, ClinGen’s effort is
almost exclusively focused on the interpretation of germline variants and their role in heritable phenotypes,
leaving a significant gap in clinical interpretation of somatic variants in cancer. Concurrently the Global Alliance
for Genomics in Health (GA4GH) has begun to develop standards for genomic data interoperability. The
Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) resource provides a sophisticated variant knowledge
curation interface. In this application, we propose to create a knowledgebase of high quality assertions of the
clinical significance of somatic variants in cancer that utilizes the CIViC platform, adapts the procedures of
ClinGen to somatic variant interpretation and implements the interoperability standards of the GA4GH. This
effort is needed to broadly enable research and clinical translation involving the use of somatic cancer variant
knowledge as it relates to oncogenicity, diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response. By adapting the
ClinGen germline model, we will establish processes to engage the expert community and facilitate the
creation of Somatic Cancer Variant Curation Expert Panels (SC-VCEPs). Formation of these SC-VCEPs will
support creation of a ClinGen Somatic Knowledgebase of clinical cancer variant assertions curated and
approved by experts. SC-VCEPs will be the primary drivers of curation and domain specific guideline creation.
We will adopt and guide ongoing development of several emerging standards that enable the Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles for genomic knowledge sharing. Specifically, we will
adopt the GA4GH Variation Representation Specification (VRS) and associated genomic knowledge
framework of the GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Work Stream. We will also use our
expert-driven curation activities to inform and develop curation and minimal information standards. Finally, we
will use natural language processing (NLP) to accelerate a set of defined human knowledge curation tasks that
currently limit the rate of human curation. Specifically, NLP will be used to (1) streamline curator activities
through integration of text-mined data directly into CIViC; (2) prioritize papers based on their likely evidence
level such as clinical trials or case reports; (3) identify and match a larger variety of cancer variant types
through a variant hierarchy system; and (4) automate simple but time-consuming tasks such as enforcing
consistent synonym usage. Our ultimate goal is to support a large community of domain-specific expert panels
working together to create a public knowledgebase of cancer variants and their clinical relevance."

10792596,"Significance: In every heartbeat, cardiac muscle cells generate contractile force to pump blood into circulation
against a mechanical load. Cardiomyocytes also sense load changes and adjust the contractility to maintain
cardiac output. Excessive overload in pathological conditions leads to heart diseases such as arrhythmias and
heart failure. However, fundamental knowledge gaps still exist in the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
mechano-transduction in cardiomyocytes, and therapeutic treatments for mechanical stress associated heart
diseases (e.g., hypertension induced arrhythmias and heart failure, DCM, HFpEF) are severely limited to date.
Innovations: Previous experiments using load-free cardiomyocytes largely missed mechanical load effects on
regulating cardiomyocytes. We will develop an innovative Cell-in-Gel-TR technology to control mechanical load
at the single-cell level. Our studies reveal that the mechanical load on the cell during contraction can feedback
to regulate the 3 dynamic systems in excitation-Ca2+ signaling-contraction (E-C) coupling; closing these
feedback loops enables the cardiomyocyte to autoregulate E-C coupling in response to load changes. This
conceptual innovation will be explored in our R35 research to understand how mechanical load affects
cardiomyocyte function and heart diseases. Research Plan: The central theme of my research is to elucidate
how the 3 dynamic systems in E-C coupling feedforward and feedback to control the heart function as a
dynamically regulated smart pump. In R35, we will expand and deepen our research beyond the 2 R01s to do
multi-scale systematic studies of the mechano-transduction mechanisms and functional consequences. (1)
Molecular level study to decipher mechano-chemo-electro-transduction (MCET) pathways, identify the key
players, and determine molecular mechanisms. (2) Cell level study to investigate how mechanical load
regulates the dynamic systems of excitation-Ca2+ signaling-contraction coupling. (3) Heart level study to
probe how mechanical load regulates the intact heart function. (4) Study of heart diseases to understand
why/how pathological overload leads to cardiac remodeling, arrhythmias, and heart failure. These 4 parts are
designed to inform and enhance one another to provide a comprehensive view on how mechano-transduction
pathways work at molecular level, integrate at the cell level, and manifest to the heart’s ability to autoregulate
contractility in response to mechanical load changes in health and diseases. Capability and Adaptability: The
strength of my research stems from interdisciplinary approach. The history of my research shows a strong
track record in developing new technologies by combining rigorous methods in physics, chemistry, and biology.
In R35, I will continue developing innovative solutions and to use cutting-edge technologies to achieve the
transformative research goals. Expected Outcome and Impact: The research outcome will shift the paradigm
of cardiac E-C coupling to Autoregulatory Model, which will open new conceptual framework for understanding
how mechanical load affects heart diseases and help identify molecular targets for developing new therapies."
10793563,"Summary
The goal of this grant is to understand the role of SHH signaling in regulation of regenerative healing in
mammalian skin wounds. Most mammals including humans are deficient in regenerative skin healing. After
injury, wound healing typically results in 'repair' (also defined as fibrosis/scarring). This process fails to fully
restore the lost tissue to its original form, resulting in “a cellular band-aid”. The inability of mammals to regenerate
normal skin is most notably illustrated by the lack of skin appendages including hair follicles in the wound scar. A
major hurdle in hair follicle regeneration in skin wounds is the failure to reestablish the hair follicle inductive niche
known as the dermal papilla (DP).
 Here, we show that SHH activation within 'repaired' (scarring) wound dermis induces de novo DP
formation leading to HFN. These data clearly demonstrate that myofibroblasts within scarring wounds are not
intrinsically incapable of forming the regenerative niche. We hypothesize that scarring cells may possess
the regenerative potential but are missing the crucial developmental cue, SHH. To address this
hypothesis, first, we will ask if Wnt signaling, which is active in fibrotic wounds, is required for SHH-driven DP
formation and resultant HFN in wounds. For this we will perform loss-of-function studies on b-catenin, an
essential effector of canonical Wnt signaling, in genetically modified wounds with ectopic SHH activation
(Aim1). We will also examine the potential of mature Wnt-active fibroblasts to convert to DP in Hh-activated
wounds after healing is complete. These experiments will address the potential plasticity of fully differentiated
cells and how induction by the Hh pathway may alter their phenotype (Aim 1). Second, preliminary single cell
RNAseq analyses comparing Hh-activated and WT wounds have identified downstream expression of several
BMPs following Hh activation. We will examine the role of BMP signaling in mediating the function of Hh signaling
through loss- and gain-of-function studies on BMP receptor signaling. We will also examine the ability of
immediate Hh regulators Gli1 and 2, to directly bind BMP gene regulatory sites by Chip-Seq analysis (Aim
2). Third, human wounds strongly resemble 'repaired' murine wounds in many traits. We will test whether
human wounds can respond to SHH signals to produce DP by introducing viral active-SmoM2 or soluble SHH
agonists into xenograft-and-wounding models. Importantly, we will delineate the response of human dermal cells
to SHH through single cell RNAseq analyses, and also compare these results with those from murine wounds
(Aim3). These combined studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms required to induce hair
follicle regeneration in an otherwise hairless wound environment and will provide essential new information about
how human wounds may compare with murine wounds and be manipulated for improved healing."

Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the
factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological
mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre-
clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to
understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified
an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females
and was associated with an augmented response to the foot shock unconditioned stimulus. A better
understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues
for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We have collected preliminary data
implicating the neural projections from the anterior cingulate (ACC) to ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
(vlPAG) as a potentially novel, sex-dependent circuit that integrates sensory pain information into conditioned
and unconditioned fear responses. We propose here to explore sex differences in this circuit at both the
structural and functional level. First, we will use a retrograde tracer to perform a quantitative mapping of ACC-
vlPAG projections, then we will characterize the post-synaptic vlPAG targets of ACC afferents using trans-
synaptic viral approaches combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Next, we will record ACC-vlPAG
activity during fear conditioning using fiber photometry to correlate activity to stimulus presentation and
behavioral responses, and finally test the causal role this circuit plays in driving darting using circuit-specific
chemogenetic techniques. Together, these studies can provide insight into sex-dependent circuit mechanisms
underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability."

Diabetes is a disorder of glucose homeostasis that causes excess hospitalization, morbidity and early mortality
among the more than 34.2 million disease-affected Americans. Consequently, developing pharmacologic
methods to preserve β-cell function and/or stimulate β-cell mass expansion is of intense interest. Presently, the
creation of improved diabetes medications is stymied by a dearth of safe therapeutic targets. In fact, on-target
but off-tissue drug effects are slowing progress across multiple diabetes therapeutic domains including β-cell
regeneration, β-cell preservation, and immune-protection. In principle, stimulating the regeneration of insulin-
producing β-cells could be used to restore or enhance endogenous insulin production capacity. Recently, we
developed several new highly potent chemical inducers of human β-cell proliferation. However, the non-selective
growth-promoting activity of these molecules prevents further clinical development. Consequently, a “modular”
(readily transferable) system for β-cell-targeted drug delivery is needed to realize the next generation of diabetes
therapeutics. To address this challenge, we are developing a β-cell-targeted drug delivery module based upon
the uniquely high zinc content of β-cells. In this system, a zinc-chelating moiety is covalently integrated into a
replication-promoting (cargo) compound to generate a bi-functional compound (βRepZnC) that selectively
enhances β-cell drug accumulation and replication-promoting activity. Here, we combine a medicinal chemistry
effort with systematic in vitro and in vivo interrogation to advance our platform technology for β-cell-targeted drug
delivery. In Aim 1, we will define the chemical “rules” that govern zinc-dependent β-cell targeting. We will
synthesize and assay diverse βRepZnCs where cargo/chelator composition, zinc-binding affinity and
physicochemical properties are systematically varied. In Aim 2, we will examine the in vivo β-cell selectivity
(accumulation and replication-promoting activity) of systemically-delivered βRepZnCs. We will use desorption
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MSI) to measure tissue-specific drug accumulation and predict
tissue-specific bioactivity. This work will demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of novel βRepZnC therapeutics in
multiple diabetes mouse models and deliver a validated methodology; overcoming a major barrier to developing
cell-targeted therapeutics: the lack of a facile method for in vivo measurement of tissue-specific drug delivery.
In Aim 3, we will use CRISPR technology to genetically dissect the pathways that control β-cell zinc and zinc-
binding drug accumulation. As part of this effort, we will genetically enhance β-cell βRepZnCs accumulation and
β-cell selective replication induction. Overall, our studies will advance a modular technology for β-cell-targeted
drug delivery, optimize βRepZnCs, validate a greatly needed tool for assessing cell-targeted drug delivery in vivo
and provide fundamental (targetable) insights into β-cell biology."

Evidence-based psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression consistently
produce strong, clinically meaningful effects for many individuals. However, these interventions also have
significant dropout rates, a large minority of individuals continue to have debilitating symptoms, and even those
who respond may be vulnerable to relapse upon future stressors. More efficient and mechanistically precise
interventions are needed. Consistent with the cross-cutting theme of studying the role of the environment in the
NIMH Strategic Plan, the etiologic role of exposure to destabilizing, stressful life events is common to both
PTSD and depression. Not only do they share common distress-related triggers, symptoms, and maintaining
processes, but they also commonly co-occur (upwards of 60%). Current PTSD and depression treatments
typically focus on their respective disorders rather than on common processes that maintain psychopathology;
and, importantly, they do not explicitly target positive adaptive processes associated with resilience. Decades
of experimental studies, prospective studies, and psychotherapy trials have identified interconnected
maladaptive and adaptive processes associated with persistent psychopathology after stressful, destabilizing
events. These maladaptive processes include: 1) unproductive event processing; 2) avoidance; and 3) reward
sensitivity and processing deficits. These processes prolong negative mood, interfere with adaptive coping and
processing of emotional material, and increase sensitivity to future stressful life events. PATH (Positive
Processes and Transition to Health) directly targets these maladaptive processes while also teaching parallel
adaptive skills (constructive processing, approach, and positive emotion processing and reward seeking). Six,
90-min sessions target individuals who have experienced a destabilizing life event and have persistent
stressor-related symptoms. PATH utilizes life event processing (revisiting, meaning making), focusing
repeatedly on an identified destabilizing life event, positive life events, and future events as a framework to
identify maladaptive processes and teach constructive processing skills. In a small open trial (R61, N = 45), we
will examine whether PATH engages the key targets of unproductive processing, avoidance, and reward
deficits. Next, we will conduct a randomized trial of PATH (R33, N = 135), comparing PATH to a Progressive
Muscle Relaxation, seeking to replicate changes in the targets in a larger sample and examine PATH's impact
on stressor-related psychopathology (PTSD, depression). PATH, a brief and focused treatment that targets key
psychological processes common to PTSD and MDD, has the potential to reduce dropout, improve treatment
engagement and outcomes, identify potential treatment mechanisms, and ultimately reduce the costly human
and economic burden of stressor-related psychopathology."
10901828,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rates of anxiety and depression in youth are substantial, causing a major unmet need for effective
interventions. Although some progress has been made in preventing these internalizing problems in
adolescents, further research is needed that specifically targets theoretically and empirically supported
risk processes. An important and salient risk factor found to increase the likelihood of anxiety and
depression is negative affectivity – a partially heritable trait propensity to experience and express more
frequent, intense, and enduring aversive emotional states. The proposed randomized controlled
prevention trial builds on our finding from our longitudinal study that elevated levels of negative
affectivity during adolescence prospectively predicted internalizing disorders in early adulthood
(Zinbarg et al., 2016); moreover, this relation was mediated by changes in momentary negative affect
(mNA) measured with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (Adam et al., 2018). The first phase
(R61) of the proposed selective prevention trial will test whether an app-based, coach-supported
mindfulness intervention as compared to an assessment-only control reduces momentary negative
affect, measured with ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in 120 adolescents (age 12-16) at-
risk based on their having high levels of trait negative affectivity. EMA will be used to measure average
daily mood, (the “Target”) collected six times a day across three days at pre-, mid-, and post-
intervention. “Target” engagement will be defined as a medium effect size (>.40) in the comparison of
youth randomized to MBI versus control on the target – momentary negative affect – at post-test,
adjusting for pre-test levels. We also will assess the dose-response relation by testing the association
between number of sessions and exercises completed with changes in momentary negative affect and
weekly mood ratings. In the second phase (R33), we will conduct a replication trial with a new sample
of 360 at-risk (i.e., high trait negative affectivity) youths (ages 12-16) randomized to one of three
conditions – MBI, a nonspecific control, or an assessment-only control. Youth will be evaluated with
regard to the target (i.e., mNA), internalizing symptoms and disorders, and functioning (e.g., social,
academic) at baseline and post-intervention (R61 and R33), and at a 6-month follow-up (R33). Finally,
in the R33 we will test if significant reductions in momentary negative affect are associated with
improvements (or less worsening) in internalizing symptoms and fewer onsets of internalizing disorders."
10809577,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among all U.S. citizens and is the 2nd leading cause of death among
youth and emerging adults between the ages of 15 and 29. One group that is particularly vulnerable to suicide
is sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). SGM is an umbrella term used to describe individuals who identify as
non-exclusively heterosexual (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual) and/or as transgender/non-binary (e.g., identify as a
gender different from their birth sex). Indeed, recent U.S. representative findings from 2017 underscore striking
disparities in suicidality between sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents, with 23% of sexual minority
youth reporting one or more suicide attempts (in the past 12 months) vs. 5.4% of heterosexual youth. Prevalence
of lifetime suicide attempts among gender minorities is also substantially elevated compared to the general
population, with 45% of 18-24-year-old transgender individuals reporting a history of one more suicide attempts.
Despite these substantial health disparities in suicide among SGM youth/emerging adults, no known suicide
prevention programs exist for this highly vulnerable population. Given this crucial gap in the literature, the
proposed study will adapt and test an innovative intervention that integrates patient navigation with the Safety
Planning Intervention (PN+SPI) for SGM youth/emerging adults designed to target mechanisms (e.g., reductions
in thwarted belongingness and increases in suicide-related coping skills) that theoretically underlie suicide. If the
PN+SPI intervention displays a clinically meaningful effect on the purported targets (i.e., reductions in thwarted
belongingness and increases in suicide-related coping skills) during the open-phase trial (R61 phase) and is
feasible and acceptable, we will subsequently move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial of the PN+SPI by comparing it to SPI alone to assess feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary efficacy. During the randomized controlled trial, in which we will sample 170 youth and emerging
adult SGMs, we will also evaluate the mechanisms of action of the PN+SPI intervention through longitudinal
analysis. The proposed project has substantial public health significance as SGMs are one of the most vulnerable
groups for suicidality globally. Given the brevity of the PN+SPI intervention and its emphasis on safety planning
and accessing community resources, the PN+SPI intervention has high potential for wide dissemination and
public health impact."

10844351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This is an application for continued support for years 46-50 of a postdoctoral training program in
medical genetics based in the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics (DMHG) at Baylor College of
Medicine (BCM). The DMHG is a bridging department with major clinical activities and strong programs in
basic, translational, and clinical research. It uniquely integrates many of the activities that are traditionally
found dispersed through many academic departments and centers at most US academic institutions into a
single department at BCM. At our core, the training mission unifies all three domains and the success of this
training program over the past five decades reflects that integration. The emphasis of this postdoctoral
program is on medical and human genetics and on molecular approaches. There are 90 training faculty, 67
with primary and 23 with secondary appointments in the DMHG (compared with 90 at the last competing
renewal submitted in 2017). Our strategic plan has enhanced the training environment including new faculty
recruitment, development of new clinical training tracks, formation of a diagnostic laboratory joint venture,
development of a virtual platform to facilitate patient engagement in clinical care, education, and research, and
establishment of an Office of Community Engagement and Diversity (OCED). However, the core of the DMHG
mission remains research spanning all areas of human and model organism genetics with focus on medical
genetic practice. Trainees derive mainly from ACGME accredited residency and fellowship programs. The
focus of the program is to attract highly qualified ABMGG MD, MD/PhD, and PhD trainees who seek an
intensive research experience. In the past four years of this cycle of funding, 82% of 12 month slots were
assigned to such trainees. Powerful drivers of training include faculty integration within the DMHG Division of
Research affairs including multiple NIH funded centers, clinical implementation of innovative technologies in
the genetic diagnostic arena, and integration of these elements into clinical training. Our stellar alumni who
now populate our and many other medical genetics programs is evidence of the success of this integrated
approach. Major strengths of the training environment include a large clinical genetics component; large,
comprehensive, and sophisticated diagnostic laboratories; high national ranking of NIH funding and awards
among US genetics departments (1st for over decade); NIH Large Scale Sequencing Center; NIH Intellectual
and Developmental Disability Research Center; NIH Center for Mendelian Genomics now GREGoR; NIH
Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Clinical Site (CS), Sequencing Core (SC), and Model Organism

10789871,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Insufficient T cell infiltration is a major challenge in adoptive transfer therapies like CAR-T. Therefore, one
strategy to improve therapy is to enhance T cell trafficking into tumors. However, current therapies targeting T
cell activities largely consist of immune checkpoint modulators, and very little innovation has occurred in
therapeutic design targeting T cell intrinsic regulators of intratumoral accumulation. This is due, in part, to an
incomplete understanding of the regulatory pathways involved in T cell trafficking. We recently identified Adapter
protein 2 associated kinase 1 (Aak1) as an important regulator of T cell chemotaxis into tumors in an in vivo
forward genetic screen. The primary objective of this project is to measure the translational potential of AAK1 as
a therapeutic target in cancer to augment adoptive transfer therapies, with the additional goal of better
understanding molecular functions of Aak1 as a regulator of chemokine receptor Cxcr3 internalization. These
goals will be accomplished in three aims. Aim 1 will quantify the impact of genetic modification of Aak1 on tumor
infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells in a preclinical solid tumor model. Aim 2 will determine whether Aak1
kinase activity is required for chemokine-induced internalization of Cxcr3 in primary T cells. Aim 3 will measure
the degree to which Aak1 modification impacts therapeutic efficacy in adoptive transfer therapies. This proposal
has several innovative aspects, including characterization of a novel, T cell specific Aak1 knockout mouse,
functional and mechanistic testing of a novel Aak1 mutant construct, and evaluation of Aak1 as a novel
therapeutic target to limit T cell chemotaxis into inflamed tissue. Successful completion of this project will benefit
development of novel treatment strategies for solid tumors, and findings can broadly be applied to any T cell
adoptive transfer approach and is not limited to individual CAR or TCR engineered platforms."

10857031,"Summary/Abstract: 
 Fibrotic diseases are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive 
disease with no effective treatment except lung transplant. PH is also a risk factor for other health 
complications including lung cancer. A major characteristic of PF is increased deposition of extracellular matrix 
(ECM) that leads to lung tissue stiffening and loss of function. PF is a heterogeneous disease characterized by 
aberrant signaling pathways of oxidative stress (OS), TGFβ, and NF-κB. We have previously reported 
increased ROS and activation of MAPK, NF-κB, and TGFβ in alveolar epithelial cells following treatment with 
known lung fibrotic toxicants silica and multi-walled carbon nanoparticles (MWCNT). Our previous studies also 
showed increased expression of Col3A1 and TGFβ in alveolar epithelial cells in response to MWCNT. While 
PF is multifactorial, studies have linked reactive oxygen species (ROS) and aberrant microRNAs (miRs) in lung 
fibrosis development. How exactly ROS regulate miRs that drive lung fibrosis development remains largely 
unknown and is the focus of the present application. In our study of human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells 
exposed to MWCNT, we found that: (1) miR-1 is downregulated; (2) TSP-1 is up-regulated; and (3) exogenous 
mimic miR-1 suppresses TSP-1, a major activator of TGFβ. These findings suggest that miR-1 and TSP-1 are 
regulated by MWCNT and targeting miR-1 and TSP-1 might inhibit TGFβ-mediated fibrotic response. The 
central hypothesis of the current project is that ROS suppress miR-1 which promotes increased TSP-1 and 
active TGFβ fibrotic signaling. Specific aims are: (1) determine the mechansims by which miR-1 is regulated; 
(2) determine the mechanistic link between miR-1 and fibrotic signaling via TSP-1/TGFβ (or other pathways 
emerging from mRNASeq data); and (3) determine the function of miR-1 in lung fibrosis in vivo by analyzing 
whether a model of bleomycin- and MWCNT-lung fibrosis in mice and exogenous miR-1 treated mice are less 
prone to lung fibrosis than control miR-1 untreated mice. The proposed study will elucidate cellular and 
molecular mechanism involved in lung fibrosis by targeting TSP-1 via miR-1. This hypothesis, if proven, will 
establish a potential microRNA therapy in pulmonary fibrosis."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the care of patients with metastatic melanoma.
Unfortunately, not all patients benefit from this therapy, and rational combinatorial strategies to enhance ICI
efficacy in therapy non-responders are needed. We and others have shown that patients with liver metastases
derive limited clinical benefit from ICI across a wide variety of disease types. In preclinical colorectal and
melanoma models, we discovered that liver metastases cause immunotherapy resistance by siphoning tumor-
specific T cells from systemic circulation. Within the liver, activated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells undergo
apoptosis. Consequently, liver metastases create a systemic immune desert in preclinical models. Similarly,
patients with liver metastases have reduced peripheral T cell numbers and diminished tumoral T cell diversity
and function. In preclinical models, liver-directed radiotherapy reduces and metabolically refines
immunosuppressive hepatic macrophages, increases hepatic T cell survival, and reduces hepatic siphoning of
T cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that liver SBRT address ICI resistance in melanoma patients
with liver metastases. We are now prospectively testing this strategy of combining liver SBRT with ipilimumab
and nivolumab in melanoma patients with liver metastases. In Aim 1, we will determine whether liver SBRT
combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab reverses hepatic and systemic immune dysfunction in patients
enrolled on our investigator initiated clinical trial by correlating tumoral and peripheral blood immune changes
with response. In Aim 2, we will determine how liver SBRT combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab reverses
hepatic and systemic immune dysfunction in preclinical models of liver metastases. In Aim 3, we will determine
whether liver SBRT modulates hepatic myeloid purine production and signaling to promote immune responses
in metastatic melanoma. The completion of these aims as well as the associated clinical trial will establish the
safety of liver SBRT with ipilimumab and nivolumab, provide preliminary efficacy measures of combination
therapy, allow the development of biomarkers of response in preclinical models of liver metastases, and
evaluate biomarkers of response in patients. The ultimate goal of this work is to test rationally-developed novel
combination of radiotherapy and ICI in hopes of improving the care of melanoma patients with liver metastases
who are resistant to immunotherapy."

 While a growing body of work has contributed to our understanding of synapse
assembly, less is known about how synapses are maintained throughout life. This long life of
synapses is crucial for the sustained function of neural circuits, including those supporting
cognition, movement, and other vital functions. However, maintaining long-lived synaptic
connections presents a cell biological challenge, as synaptic proteins have finite lifetimes,
synaptic vesicles turnover rapidly, and protein synthesis is scarce in the presynaptic
compartment. This project will study the mechanisms of presynaptic maintenance, using C.
elegans as a model system. In Aim 1, I will investigate the proteins involved in maintaining
synaptic structures, using the auxin-inducible degron system to remove the candidate proteins
SYD-2, SYD-1, SAD-1, CDK-5, and PCT-1 from the mature nervous system. Changes in
synapse organization will be assessed using endogenous, cell-type specific markers of synaptic
vesicles and active zone proteins. In Aim 2, I will identify regulators of the presynaptic
scaffolding protein SYD-2. I will implement a visual forward genetic screen to identify candidates
that regulate SYD-2 stability, using a pulse-chase SYD-2 HaloTag approach to visualize SYD-2
turnover. In Aim 3, I will identify regulators of SYD-2 through the use of Split-TurboID proximity
biotinylation to detect interacting partners of SYD-2 in the presynaptic compartment. Candidate
regulators of SYD-2 turnover will be assessed using the SYD-2 HaloTag system. This work will
identify key synaptic maintenance proteins and their regulators. Understanding the mechanisms
that maintain stable synapses provides therapeutic avenues for preserving synapses in aging
and neurodegenerative diseases. This project, performed in the laboratory of Dr. Kang Shen at
Stanford University, provides a strong training opportunity for me in the fields of cell biology and
neuroscience, and I will gain new experience with the C. elegans model system, genetic
manipulations, and microscopy."
10808054,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT:
Venous malformations (VM) originate from impaired development of the venous network, resulting in massively
dilated and dysfunctional veins. Vascular lesions are usually present at birth, continuing to expand with time and
never spontaneously regress. VM result in significant morbidity and pain often leading to serious local and
systemic complications. Standard clinical management consists of sclerotherapy and surgical resection.
However, because these therapies manage symptoms rather than targeting underlying disease etiology,
malformed veins often require repeated interventions. Therefore, novel targeted therapies for VM are of high
importance.
Gain-of function mutations in the endothelial-specific tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 have been identified as the
leading driver of VM. TIE2 has been shown to regulate both maintenance of vascular quiescence and promotion
of angiogenesis, but its role in the vascular lumen expansion has not been explored. Research into the molecular
and cellular abnormalities which result from hyperactive TIE2 will provide the necessary groundwork for the
development of the targeted molecular treatments for VM. Our results, recently published, show that TIE2
signaling promotes activation of c-ABL (Abelson kinase 1) and that genetic and pharmacological c-ABL targeting
significantly reduced vascular lumen size. The mechanisms leading to the pathogenic lumen expansion are still
largely unexplored and the role of c-ABL in the pathophysiology of VM and vascular anomalies is unknown.
With the identification of novel mediators of the TIE2-c-ABL signaling axis, we can now develop a research
program to investigate their role in vascular lumen expansion with the goal of identifying novel targets for VM.
To perform these studies, we will utilize our VM xenograft murine models and a recently devised in vitro three-
dimensional system to study VM lumen formation and expansion. To advance our understanding of VM, we will
employ a rigorous approach based on the complementary use of the well-established HUVEC-TIE2-L914F cell
line, VM patient derived EC and patient tissue to confirm the significance of our findings for the pathophysiology
of VM.
Additionally, our studies on VM will provide cellular and mechanistic insights to advance our understanding of
pathological and physiological vessel formation and size maintenance."

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer, affecting one in seven men. Even
when treated with a radical prostatectomy, historically about 20% of patients exhibit tumor recurrence. This
proposal will focus on the integration of two separate, complimentary datasets to better differentiate high risk
patients: multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) and whole-mount post-surgical prostate
pathology samples. We will develop radio-pathomic algorithms capable of predicting underlying pathomic
features from non-invasive imaging in order to differentiate prostate cancer with high metastatic potential. Our
overarching hypothesis is that microscopic, heterogeneous pathomic features of prostate cancer are reliably
detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic quantitative MP-MRI. Non-invasively mapping these features will
provide a clinically useful tool for differentiating aggressive from indolent prostate cancer, and for potentially
targeting with radiation.
 This proposal includes two specific aims in response to the goals outlined in PAR-19-264. Specific to
the funding opportunity announcement: Aim 1 will develop radio-pathomic approaches for defining imaging-
based biomarkers capable of distinguishing aggressive from indolent prostate cancer. This will be done at the
microscopic level in Aim 1.1 with histology, and then at the macroscopic level in Aim 1.2 with MP-MRI. Aim 1.3
will test the resilience of the radio-pathomic algorithm by intentionally perturbing the system and algorithms.
Combining the Rad-Path datasets with clinical variables in Aim 1.4 will look to improve sensitivity and specificity
for early detection and differential diagnosis, by correlating our radio-pathomic maps with other omics.
Additionally, included in Aim 1, are extensive validation experiments meant to further establish the robustness
of the radio-pathomic algorithm. In Aim 2, this project will translate the radio-pathomic algorithms to the clinic.
This will include in Aim 2.1 adapting our algorithms to two clinical MR imaging systems (GE and Siemens),
and in Aim 2.2 developing a radio-pathomic driven MRI protocol for serial imaging on a combined MR-LINAC
system, one of only two operational in the US. Completion of this project will provide a powerful set of
quantitative imaging tools to clinicians for improved differentiation of high-risk prostate cancer and for
measuring response to prostate cancer therapy."

SUMMARY
 pregnancy outcomes, including premature birth and stillbirth, are the leading causes of neonatal
and mortality. A frequent cause of preterm birth and stillbirth is intrauterine infection, which occurs
bacteria ascend from the vagina into the uterus and invade the amniotic cavity, leading to inflammation,
damage, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one such bacterium
with ascending infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The principal risk factor for this is
vaginal colonization; however the mechanisms by which GBS persist i n the 
and ascend to the uterus remain unknown. GBS colonization status is intermittent and can be transient,
reflecting a combination of GBS determinants, antagonism by commensal flora, and host immune
, female genital tract
responses. The current proposal seeks to address these dynamic aspects of GBS vaginal carriage, specifically
1) bacterial adherence to host cells/tissue of the FGT, 2) competition with vaginal microbiota, and 3) evasion of
host defense. Recent studies have demonstrated that GBS stimulates vaginal epithelial exfoliation by
activating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to loss of barrier function and GBS
dissemination to the upper FGT and fetus. We have recently discovered a GBS surface adhesin, BspC, that
directly interacts with host intermediate filaments, including keratin 19 and vimentin, a canonical marker of
EMT. We hypothesize that when EMT is induced the BspC-vimentin interaction plays an important role in GBS
vaginal persistence and ascending infection. We have further discovered that GBS has a type VII secretion
system (T7SS) that contributes to colonization. We hypothesize that T7SS is important for competition with
vaginal microbiota for niche establishment and secreting anti-eukaryotic toxins that may invoke a host immune
response. We have also demonstrated that IL-17A is produced during GBS colonization and that IL-17+ cells,
such as MAITs and  T cells, actually contributed to GBS ascending spread. We hypothesize that
IL-17
induced
BspC-vimentin These hypotheses will be addressed in the following
specific aims: AIM 1: Elucidate the contribution of BspC and intermediate filaments to GBS vaginal
persistence, AIM 2: Examine the function of newly discovered GBS T7SS in mediating vaginal niche
establishment and inter-bacterial competition, AIM 3: Determine the contribution of IL-17 and MAITs to the
pathogenesis of GBS colonization. These studies should increase our understanding of the bacterial and host
factors involved in the colonization and persistence within the FGT that impact GBS ascending infection and
neonatal disease.
IL-17 and
producing T cells in the FGT induce EMT and barrier breakdown. This comes full circle; Once EMT is
as a defensive response to initiate cellular exfoliation, GBS hijacks this process, possibly through a
interaction, to persistent in the FGT."
10794267,"Pathogenic variants in the Cyclin-dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD, MIM 300672, 105830) a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) associated with cognitive and motor dysfunction and cortical visual impairment. Recent data suggest CDD is one of the most common genetic causes of DEE. Work in CDD animal models has demonstrated the ability for disease modification and symptom reversal: worldwide efforts are now underway to develop therapeutic strategies (including gene therapy) to treat and potentially cure CDD. While there are four active clinical trials, none assesses the full spectrum of this DEE to address true disease modification. While capability for disease modifying therapies is accelerating, there is a critical barrier for clinical trial readiness that may result in failure of these therapies, not due to lack of efficacy but due to lack of validated outcome measures.  CDD has been associated historically with Rett syndrome but there are many clear distinctions and CDD has emerged as an independent disorder. Some Clinical Outcome Measures (COMs) can be adapted from Rett syndrome COMs, whereas others need to be developed specifically for CDD. Our research network is uniquely positioned to develop clinical trial readiness for CDD by pairing exceptional experience in the development and validation of outcome measures with an extensive network of CDD experts and clinical trialists. Our goals are to 1) refine and validate appropriate quantitative COMs and biomarkers and 2) conduct a multi-site clinical trial readiness study to ensure that they can be successfully implemented. We will test the hypothesis that CDD specific COMs can be refined to accurately and reproducibly track meaningful changes in clinical trials: Aim 1: Generate and validate a suite of COMs and biomarkers necessary to comprehensively assess disease modification in CDD. Aim 2: Conduct a multi-site clinical trial readiness study to assess implementation, longitudinal stability, and collect baseline COMs and EEG/evoked potential data. Overall Impact: These outcome measures will establish clinical trial readiness for CDD and generate historic baseline outcome data, ensuring optimal testing of potential new therapeutics including gene therapy. Furthermore, these measures will be adaptable to other DEEs by enabling choices of outcome measures beyond existing NINDS supported measurement tools (NeuroQoL, PROMIS, Toolbox) that are not designed for the severity of the DEE populations."
10811651,"Current research in pediatric hospice and palliative care focuses on inpatient hospice and
palliative care settings and is still largely driven by adult-based data and paradigms,
insufficiently addressing clinically significant needs of children and adolescents. The long-term
goal is to design pediatric home-based hospice and palliative care (PHBHPC) care systems
tailoring high-quality, goal-concordant, personalized care to children, adolescents, and families.
The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a single set of PHBHPC quality domains
integrating newly-identified, patient-prioritized perspectives with those from clinicians and
parents. The central hypothesis is that pediatric patients will use different language to describe
important aspects of their care than providers or parents. This hypothesis builds on the team’s
prior collaboration, using a Delphi process through which PHBHPC providers identified two
novel domains: Continuity of Care and Bereavement. This team’s subsequent study with
parents of children receiving PHBHPC identified another domain: Compassionate Care. The
rationale is that the proposed study provides the missing dimension of children themselves in
defining PHBHPC, and integrates their voices with caregivers and providers to inform
benchmarking and quality improvement, program development and evaluation. In order to
achieve the objective, the following three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Establish and define
factors children and adolescents identify as important in PHBHPC; 2) Extend and validate
existing provider and caregiver datasets to maximize representativeness and minimize historical
threat; and 3) Integrate patient-prioritized factors with those from providers and caregivers into a
single document of PHBHPC domains of quality. The proposed research is innovative, in the
applicants’ opinion, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by
shifting current research paradigms in three ways. First, the perspectives of all stakeholders are
collected and integrated: PHBHPC patients, parents or other caregivers, and providers.
Second, the focus is on PHBHPC rather than on inpatient hospice and palliative care. Third, the
gaps in populations designated by NIH as under-studied are addressed. This contribution is
expected to be significant because it will be the first to study PHBHPC quality integrating all
stakeholder input – patient, family, and clinician – enabling improved quality science through
benchmarking and data sharing, patient-reported outcomes measure development, and future
research to connect care delivery to health outcomes."
10784747,"Abstract
Lewy-Body dementias, including Parkinson’s disease Dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, are
devastating, multi-system diseases and a major cause of dementia worldwide. Patients have characteristic
symptoms that suggest dysfunction of the frontal-network, including difficulty with planning, fluctuating attention
and impaired flexible learning. The pathology of patients with dementia includes widespread aggregates of the
protein alpha-synuclein (𝛼-syn) in the frontal cortex and other extra-nigral regions. Despite this association, the
role of 𝛼-syn pathology beyond the dopaminergic system remains unclear. There is a critical need to
understand how -syn affects network function to develop treatments for Lewy Body dementias.
Our long-term goal is to develop treatments for Lewy Body Dementia by targeting circuit-level dysfunction. Our
overall hypothesis is that local -syn aggregation in the cortex disrupts prefrontal circuits, leading to executive
dysfunction. Testing this overall hypothesis requires determining the regional effect of 𝛼-syn on cellular activity
and neuronal plasticity in isolation from deficits secondary to other major neurotransmitter systems that project
to cortex. To accomplish this goal, this proposal uses viral overexpression of -syn localized to the prefrontal
cortex. By imaging the activity of individual neurons and the plasticity of dendritic spines, we can learn how
cortical cells respond to this enigmatic, disease-associated protein. We propose to use 2-photon transcranial
microscopy to determine how neuronal activity (Aim 1) and synaptic plasticity (Aim 2) respond to regional
overexpression of -syn over the course of aging. In Aim 3, we will use a rule-learning, reversal and rule-
shifting tasks adapted for head-fixed applications to determine how prefrontal-dependent learning and flexibility
respond to cortical -syn. In parallel, we will correlate cognitive performance with anatomical plasticity and
neuronal activity. Findings from this proposed research will provide targets for future studies to restore cortical
function and treat symptoms through circuit-level manipulation. In addition, by comparing outcomes across the

provide broad insights into the prefrontal cortex."
10761704,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and
homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from
studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the
three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is
poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C
data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental
domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental
domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains
represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes
either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the
progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome.
Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals
by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics,
computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues.
The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view
of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles
into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain
scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in
complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes
responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very
high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting
domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and
absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction
frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic
information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by
analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different
strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will
be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the
differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of
the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease."

Weight loss is associated with a reduction in obesity-related health risks, but can be difficult, with preventing
subsequent weight regain even more challenging. As such, understanding mechanisms underlying energy
balance regulation and identifying strategies for successful weight loss and maintenance are important goals,
and are key components of the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research.
 Food intake is a complex process involving homeostatic signals (e.g., appetite-related hormones) and
non-homeostatic signals (e.g., reinforcing properties of food). One factor that may contribute to susceptibility to
obesity is a high responsivity to high-calorie foods, which promotes increased caloric intake. Food preferences
involve learned associations thought to develop via classical conditioning through repeated pairings with
external stimuli. Improving our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these processes and
attempting to modify them may be a useful strategy for weight loss and maintenance. Therefore, the proposed
study aims to investigate the neuronal and behavioral effects of an intervention designed to alter affective
associations with food, using a novel implicit priming (IP) paradigm, in which positively or negatively valenced
images are presented immediately prior to food images, but not consciously perceived. We hypothesize that IP
will alter neuronal and behavioral responses related to food intake, reducing the appeal of high-calorie foods
and promoting weight loss and maintenance.
 The project goals are to further delineate the neuronal mechanisms underlying the intervention, establish
the impact of IP on longer-term food preferences and eating behavior, and determine if it can facilitate weight-
loss maintenance in individuals with overweight/obesity. Effects of IP on neuronal responses to visual food
cues and measures of eating behaviors (food intake, preferences) will be measured not only acutely, but also
following 12 weeks of weekly IP administrations, within the context of weight-loss maintenance. Weight and
body composition will be measured before and after the intervention, and, to assess lasting effects, 12 weeks
after the intervention has ended. Participants will be randomized to active IP, control IP (with scrambled
images as primes), or to an active control, cue exposure therapy (CET). Sex-based differences will also be
examined, as studies have observed women to have stronger, more frequent food cravings, greater neuronal
response to hedonic food cues, and greater sensitivity to disgust than men. The use of neuroimaging in this
study will provide a more sensitive measure than behavioral measures alone and will help to identify
mechanisms through which the intervention changes behavior. If the project aims are achieved, it would not
only yield new information about the neurobiology of food intake behavior, but also could represent a potential
novel intervention for treatment and prevention of obesity."

 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is extremely ubiquitous, with almost all humans acquiring the infection by the age of two.  It is manifested by several secondary acute respiratory illnesses including bronchiolitis croup, bronchitis, pneumonia and the common cold.  RSV does not elicit a protective immune response in humans, which results in recurrent infections in children and adults.  Infants infected with RSV have a high risk of developing reactive airway disease, such as asthma, through adolescence.  RSV pathogenesis in adults can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and asthma.  The elderly population is at particularly high risk. These illnesses caused by RSV infection combine to represent a massive worldwide health risk and substantial financial burden to the global healthcare system.  There is currently no approved vaccine available to prevent RSV infection or disease.  
In this SBIR Phase I proposal, BlueWillow Biologics will manufacture the cGMP seeds for producing the recombinant F-protein RSV subunit with a preserved pre-fusion conformation (PrFFP), which would enable future manufacturing of clinical material for intranasal PrFFP/NE01 vaccine. The innovative feature is the application of BlueWillow’s NanoVaxTM nanoemulsion mucosal adjuvant and delivery technology to formulate PrFFP as an intranasal vaccine.  This new strategy will activate both systemic and mucosal immunity, a key protective immune response necessary to prevent viral entry and infection locally at the respiratory mucosa including the lungs. Previous RSV vaccines currently under development using F-protein antigens have been formulated for intramuscular delivery, which does not promote mucosal immunity and may compromise their effectiveness against RSV.  
Successful completion of this SBIR phase 1 proposal will provide the foundation for the clinical development and commercial release of the first mucosal NE-RSV vaccine on the market. We will execute the license agreement with NIH-VRC to obtain cGMP seeds of CHO-DG44 seeds for PrFFP production.  Following which we will perform technology transfer from NIH-VRC to BlueWillow and master cell bank for future manufacturing will be established at CDMO. The novel combination of highly antigenic F protein in its pre-fusion conformation with our innovative NanoVaxTM nanoemulsion mucosal adjuvant technology will result in a safe and effective intranasal vaccine to prevent RSV infection and disease in the elderly. This commercial product will fulfill an enormous unmet medical need."
10760244,"Title: Developing a Clinically-Relevant Genetically Engineered Mouse Model of NUT Carcinoma
Project Summary:
A testis-specific gene called Nuclear protein in testis (NUTM1) has emerged as a recurrent fusion partner of
oncogenic fusion genes in poorly understood neoplasms. Among these neoplasms, NUT carcinoma (NC) is the
most aggressive and is the paradigm for the study of NUTM1 fusion gene-associated cancers. The majority of
NCs are associated with a chromosome translocation that joins together gene fragments of the Bromodomain-
containing protein 4 (BRD4) and the NUTM1 protein. Clinical research and experimental research based on in
vitro cell culture systems has established the BRD4-NUTM1 fusion protein as the sole driver of NC. This project
will address two vital current issues in NC research:
Issue 1: Paradoxically, although BRD4-NUTM1 suffices to drive NC, ectopic expression of BRD4-NUTM1 in
non-NC cells is unequivocally cytotoxic. Whether there is a specific cell type in which NCs originate — and how
these cells are able to circumvent the cytotoxic effects of BRD4-NUTM1 — is a mystery.
Issue 2: As the driver of NC oncogenesis, BRD4–NUTM1 is the most promising drug target for treating NC.
However, targeted therapy strategies directed against the BRD4 fragment of BRD4-NUTM1 have been
disappointing, largely because of intolerable side effects that are due to endogenous BRD4 being broadly
expressed. Targeting the testis-specific NUTM1 protein has the potential to circumvent most systematic side
effects in male patients and all side effects in female patients, yet this strategy has not been explored in a
physiological context.
Building on our expertise in genome editing technology and unique resources in genetically engineered mouse
lines, we will address these two vital NC issues by building the first genetically engineered mouse model that
can recapitulate the tissue and physiological context of NC. Aim 1 will build and characterize an inducible
chromosome translocation mouse model for NC. Our model mice will express reporter genes for tracing and
isolating NC cells that express BRD4-NUTM1. Aim 2 will identify the NC cell type of origin by analyzing genomic
data from NC-originating normal cell populations and cells in early stages of NC development. Aim 3 will leverage
in vivo inducible BRD4-NUTM1 protein degradation to model NUTM1 targeting in order to establish a targeting
strategy for treating NC with minimal side effects.
Overall Impact. This project will produce a genetically engineered mouse model of Nut Carcinoma as an entirely
new experimental tool for studying oncogenic mechanisms of BRD4-NUTM1. Our studies will transform
understanding of early-stage NC and spur therapeutic development to treat NC without intolerable side effects.
This project will also shed light on mechanisms and treatment strategies for other poorly understood cancers
with NUTM1 fusion genes."

The primary role of the Mouse Genetics Core is to facilitate the use of mouse molecular genetics at MSK for
in vivo studies of gene functions germane to cancer. Relevant fields in which MSK investigators develop and
apply mouse models include: cell growth and behavior, stem cell biology, embryonic development,
immunobiology, genome integrity, cancer biology, and experimental therapeutics. The MGC consists of 2
sections: the Transgenic/Embryology Group (TgG) and the Molecular Biology/Tissue Culture Group (MBTCG).
Major services offered by the TgG include the production of genetically engineered mice (GEM) by pronuclear
injection of DNA or CRISPR/Cas9 and by blastocyst injection of ES cells; cryopreservation and the long-term
storage of GEM lines; strain rederivation or recovery through IVF and/or embryo transfer; performance of
special embryological and animal surgical procedures; and the provision of GEM lines such as CRE and FLPe
expressing strains. The specialized molecular biology services provided by the MBTCG include transgene
DNA purification and genotyping of founder mice; the design and production of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents for
mouse genome editing; and the identification and verification of alleles carried by gene edited mice. Services
offered by the MBTCG also include performing all aspects of gene targeting in mouse ES cells and
establishing ES cells from GEM lines. An integral role of the MGC is to provide consultation and training in the
design and production of mouse models, ES cell culture, and mouse husbandry and genetics. Rapid advances
in genome editing and sequencing technologies, in combination with the steady increase in translational
research at MSK, have resulted in a significant upsurge in demand for MGC services. In addition, the Core
continues to pursue and implement new technical developments that will expedite gene editing in mice;
ongoing efforts include the use of commercially available synthetic gRNA components and the application of
electroporation to deliver CRIPSR/Cas9 into mouse zygotes. Integrating such advancements into the Core’s
services will undoubtedly increase the productivity and reduce staff time/effort to create GEM models for MSK

The Research Pharmacy (RP) Core provides a full service facility that prepares agents developed by MSK
researchers to be used as investigational drugs in preclinical or clinical studies. The Core comprises three
principal groups: the Pharmaceutical Product Facility (PPF) for drug formulation/stability and preparation; the
Clinical Grade Production (CGP) Facility for bulk product manufacturing, purification, and vialing; and the
Pharmacy Investigational Drug Service (PIDS), which provides a service to develop, procure, prepare, and
validate the preparation, packaging, and distribution of investigational drugs for clinical use. The Core services
include, but are not limited to, formulation, analysis, and evaluation of drug release rates; prediction of
interactions; and determinations of compatibility and physical stability of medications. Owing to the
infrastructure of the Core, MSK has been able to bring into early phase clinical trials multiple distinct types of
pharmacologic agents, including traditional small molecules, radiopharmaceuticals, and vaccines.
The broad range of services and collaborative work provided by the combined PPF/CGP/PIDS groups within
the RP Core has supported the research of 33 investigators from 12 Department in 37 IRB-approved protocols.
The work of the Core has contributed to 34 publications in leading general interest or cancer journals. For
example, the therapeutic antibody 3F8 is purified, manufactured, and vialed exclusively at MSK; this
therapeutic antibody forms the backbone of the Center’s research program in neuroblastoma; and has now
been validated as an effective treatment for children with refractory neuroblastoma. The Center’s large and

During the current grant period, CCSG developmental funds were used to support the mission of the Cancer
Center in 2 categories critical to the advancement of its goals: 1) additional faculty recruitment in disciplines
related to the strategic vision of the Center and 2) pilot project grants to stimulate cross-disciplinary research
involving population science. Both categories have proven rich opportunities for the Center to strengthen and
diversify its research portfolio.
Funds requested to support faculty recruitment in strategic areas have enabled the Center to attract top talent
by providing a start-up/transition package that has enabled 8 new recruits to have the resources to immediately
develop their research programs. Since their arrival at MSK, these 8 investigators have received $23.8M in
peer-reviewed funding and produced over 25 manuscripts from their laboratories.
Funds requested to support cross-disciplinary pilot projects involving PSR and other Center programs
supported 16 projects, covering the broad spectrum of areas of population research that characterize the PSR
Program, with multiple awards in each of PSR’s major programmatic themes: 1) cancer etiology and risk; 2)
health behavior and symptom control; and 3) health care delivery, access and disparities. The projects were
multidisciplinary as a requirement, and in many cases creative cross-disciplinary interactions were formed,
matching population scientists with basic laboratory investigators or clinical investigators. Results have been
exciting, with 3 of our junior investigators receiving their first NIH grants as a result of the pilot funds provided
by this program. To date, 8 peer-reviewed grants have been awarded stemming from the research conducted
in these pilot projects (4 NCI, 2 other NIH, 2 ACS). The total direct cost from these grants is $8,816,229.

mentored-training needed to address important questions related to intervention response in an amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (aMCI) diagnosed population at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. As a neuropsychologist, Dr. Gullett
has gained clinical experience in the assessment of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and
its precursor, MCI, as well as research experience using structural neuroimaging to investigate various clinical
disorders. The support provided by the K23 mechanism through the NIA will provide Dr. Gullett with the protected
mentored-training needed to build on his current skills and become an expert in clinical neuroscience, machine
learning, and behavioral interventions for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.
Career development and training plan: Dr. Gullett’s training plan consists of foundational formal coursework in 1)
clinical trials, 2) MCI and Alzheimer’s disease effects, and 3) biostatistics and machine learning investigative
techniques. These foundations will be directly applied through mentorship by experts in the fields of behavioral
cognitive interventions, neuroimaging, and machine learning, as well as a proposed in-person workshop in functional
neuroimaging analysis. This mentored-training plan will provide Dr. Gullett with the expertise to not only carry out the
proposed project, but to become a unique and invaluable resource for future collaborative efforts applying
neuroscience-based machine learning tools to investigate personalized interventions for Alzheimer’s disease.
Research plan: The proposed project will provide the clinical trials training needed for Dr. Gullett to establish the
effectiveness of a planned take-home, 12-week cognitive training program in patients with amnestic mild cognitive
impairment (N=75; Aim 1). The expert mentorship team proposed has decades of experience in behavioral clinical
trials interventions, which will provide the applicant with design and methodology guidance, as well as the recruitment
infrastructure and resources needed to successfully carry out the proposed project. Further, this project will provide
training in multi-modal neuroimaging-based machine learning to determine the baseline neural, cognitive, and

Falls and decreased physical function increase markedly with age and result in injury, hospitalization, and
death. Safe, cost-effective primary prevention strategies are needed to reduce these adverse outcomes in the
aging U.S. population. Basic, preclinical, and clinical studies suggest that flavanols, a class of nutrients present
in high concentrations in cocoa, have favorable effects on muscle and physical performance. Flavanols
decrease oxidative stress and improve biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle growth. Emerging
studies show potential benefits of supplemental cocoa flavanols on physical performance, including grip
strength and walking speed in older adults. However, there are no large, long-term randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of the effects of supplemental flavanols on falls, muscle performance, and/or fall-related injuries. In an
ancillary study to the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), which is testing the
effects of supplemental cocoa flavanols and/or multivitamin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and
cancer, we propose the first large, placebo-controlled, prospective study to determine whether supplemental
flavanols reduce falls and improve musculoskeletal health in women aged ≥ 65 and men aged ≥ 60. In the
proposed study, we will determine effects of a cocoa flavanol supplement [600 mg/d flavanols, including 80 mg
(-)- epicatechins] and/or multivitamin on the following clinically meaningful outcomes: falls in the overall
COSMOS cohort (n=21,444) and physical performance in a clinic sub-cohort (n=603). We will test the following
hypotheses: Aim 1: In the overall COSMOS cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation will reduce risk of: (a)
injurious fall(s) resulting in a visit to a healthcare provider or hospital with medical record review and (b) two or
more falls per year and (c) injurious fall(s) (not resulting in healthcare utilization) as assessed by annual
questionnaires. Aim 2: In the clinic sub-cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation will benefit physical
performance measures at 2-year post randomization, as assessed by grip strength, walking speed, and Short
Physical Performance Battery (a composite of standing balance, walking speed, and chair stands). Aim 3: In
the overall COSMOS cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation reduces incident fractures as assessed by
annual questionnaires. We will explore whether effects of cocoa flavanols on fracture outcomes are mediated
through falls and/or bone density changes. In exploratory aims we will also assess effects of multivitamins on
these same outcomes. RCTs testing effects of multivitamins on falls and musculoskeletal outcomes are
lacking. This ancillary study maximizes cost-efficiency to fill gaps in knowledge regarding effects of flavanols
for the primary prevention of falls. We expect the proposed, rigorous translational study will elucidate whether
supplemental flavanols improve musculoskeletal health and prevent falls and declining physical performance in
the increasing number of older adults in the U.S. with potential for clinical and public health benefits."

Amyloids are β-sheet rich aggregates that accumulate in various proteinopathies. This correlation has led to the
association of amyloids with the diseased state. However, organisms across biology utilize amyloids without any
apparent detrimental effects. This raises the fundamental question; how do cells assemble non-toxic amyloids
as needed? Our lab uncovered an inducible program of physiological amyloidogenesis that converts Nucleoli
into Amyloid-bodies. While investigating these amyloid-enriched, solid-like condensates, we identified that
Terminal End Nucleotidyltransferase 4b (TENT4b) stimulated the conversion of amyloidogenic liquid-to-solid
phase transition. Our preliminary results indicate that TENTs catalyze unusually long poly(A)-rich tails to drive
amyloidogenesis. These low-complexity RNA molecules act as linear polyanionic cofactors that stimulate
amyloidogenesis. This activity is inhibited by the RNA exosome which degrades tailed RNA. In addition to
physiological amyloidogenesis, TENTs also catalyze pathological amyloidogenesis which exhausts toxic
oligomeric intermediates in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease models. Depletion of the RNA exosome that
antagonizes TENTs, delays age-associated proteotoxicity in these disease models. These results suggest the
following hypothesis for this K99:R00 application: The RNA tailing machinery drives amyloidogenesis to protect
against toxic oligomeric intermediates. We plan to test this hypothesis by: Aim 1- investigating the mechanism
that drives physiological amyloidogenesis and Aim 2- testing if this machinery protects against pathological
amyloid toxicity. This research program reveals the provocative concept that cells possess enzymes dedicated
to making non-toxic amyloids, highlighting that cellular amyloidogenesis is an actively controlled process. The
cellular use of RNA to actively control protein folding bridges unrelated fields of research and offers new
approaches to combat amyloid based disease."
10757026,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how one respiratory RNA virus can induce a tremendous diversity of
host outcomes. While we have made progress in understanding clinical, cellular, and molecular correlates of
disease severity, few studies have assessed if or how specific factors present at baseline may induce severe
disease. There is a tremendous knowledge gap in whether correlates of disease severity represent causal factors
(i.e. if presence at baseline lead to more severe infection), or may actually represent generally beneficial attempts
at restoring tissue function (i.e. a resilience mechanism), that are detrimental only in select host contexts. Despite
distinct biology of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, epidemiological studies have noted that overweight and obese
individuals are at greater risk for severe infection, implicating lipid metabolism, and further genetic studies have
found mutations in the Type I/III interferon system in severe cases. Importantly, treating the underlying causes
of severe viral respiratory diseases will require a deeper understanding of the epithelial cell states that contribute
to diverse outcomes to design host-directed therapies that complement vaccination campaigns and avoid long-
lasting damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
Recently through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swabs, we have discovered that
a muted interferon antiviral response combined with an increase in intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis potential
in respiratory epithelial cells characterizes severe vs. mild-moderate COVID-19. In this same study, we also
revealed diversified subsets of secretory and goblet cells with uncharacterized functional potential, overlapping
with subsets we had previously identified in a study of seasonal influenza. Our published data, together with that
of our colleagues, mandate further investigation into how pre-existing antiviral and cholesterol biosynthetic cell
states in human respiratory epithelial cells dictate host outcomes to respiratory viral infection.
In light of these findings, we hypothesize that baseline cholesterol biosynthesis in respiratory epithelial cells is
a critical host resilience mechanism which becomes pathogenic in the absence of effective antiviral resistance
mechanisms. This overarching hypothesis can only be tested through a shift in the conceptual and experimental
approaches we traditionally deploy (New Research Direction). Successfully testing our hypothesis will address
(Aim 1) whether cholesterol biosynthesis dictates the maximum potential interferon response in airway epithelial
cells, or whether a muted interferon response underlies enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis in mice. Furthermore,
it will identify novel contributions of airway epithelial cells to local and organismal lipid metabolism. Our work will
also test (Aim 2) the stability of metabolic and antiviral cellular phenotypes in human epithelial progenitor cells.
Successful completion of our plan will lead to the development of non-invasive screening approaches to better
ascertain risk of susceptible populations to respiratory viruses, and of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to
achieve optimal balance of host defense strategies in the respiratory tract."

10757371,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cilia sparked phenomenal interest as scientists recognized them as a fundamental cellular organelle
required for signaling. Untangling the specific mechanisms that regulate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling within
the cilium is difficult since so many mutants that disrupt ciliogenesis also affect Hh signaling. We have long
focused on a small ciliary GTPase, ARL13B, that we hypothesize integrates the regulation of ciliogenesis and
Hh signaling through distinct effectors and their downstream pathways. As a GTPase, single basepair
mutations within the GTPase domain of ARL13B are predicted to disrupt individual effector pathways. ARL13B
is highly enriched in cilia. By engineering mouse expressing only an ARL13B variant that does not localize to
cilia, we genetically uncoupled the role of ARL13B in ciliogenesis from its role in signaling. We focus on
mammalian neural development and through forward genetic screens identified mouse mutants in several
proteins related to ARL13B. Additionally, other proteins in the ARL family of GTPases are implicated in cilia
and signaling through what appear to be ARL13B related mechanisms. In the next five years, we propose
using mouse mutants to define the regulatory relationships among these players in vivo and in specific cell
types. These experiments will unravel ARL13B function in ciliogenesis, traffic of proteins to/within cilia, and
Shh signal transduction at unprecedented resolution. Thus, our proposal will generate a molecular genetic
toolkit from which the field will be poised to distinguish the regulation of cilia from that of Hh signaling. This is

Nephrotoxic metal(loid)s including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) are established
kidney toxicants in humans and are each associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD affects 10-15% of
the global population and the prevalence is increasing alongside risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension and
obesity. Research conducted during perinatal developmental windows is a major gap in our understanding of
CKD etiology that is ethically and feasibly challenging in human populations. Further, a comprehensive
assessment of the effects of nephrotoxic metal mixtures (NMM) on kidney development and function remains
unknown, and fundamental gaps remain in how low-level early-life toxic exposures may alter kidney development
and maturation, initiating subclinical pathways to CKD. Perinatal life includes susceptible windows of kidney
development because life-stage-specific processes of metanephric branching, nephrogenesis, renal blood flow
regulation, and ion homeostatic processes are rapidly developing in comparison to the adult kidney. Small
alterations in bioenergetics due to NMM exposures at these life stages may set forth subtle changes in kidney
development or function that may not manifest clinically for years but can be detected and ameliorated if identified
early. Further, organismal and suborganismal responses predictive of nephrotoxicity provide mechanistic
information for formal risk assessment-based extrapolation to population-level effects. Our transdisciplinary
consortium efforts will enable risk assessment of real-life exposures to NMMs by harnessing: i) population-based
prenatal exposures to NMM from existing pregnancy cohorts and nationally-representative data among women
of reproductive age; ii) in vivo models (e.g. zebrafish, mouse) to determine the physiological impact and dose-
response of key affected pathways; iii) complementary assays in in vitro human kidney organoids to define
molecular mechanisms linking NMM exposure to adverse outcomes; and iv) experimental evidence of mixture
toxicity derived with population-relevant exposures to assess risks associated with the mixture using a ‘similar
mixture approach’ (SMACH) - a critical need valuable for risk assessors to derive regulatory guidance values
and improve public health. Moreover, the proposed studies address critical gaps in our understanding of how
NMM impact the developing kidney and will generate new findings on mechanisms as well as inform the early
life pathophysiology of adult CKD. This proposal leverages our team’s expertise in mixtures biostatistics and
epidemiology, risk assessment, metals nephrotoxicology, developmental biology, molecular renal physiology,
and bioengineering."

The biomedical research training program, CAU G-RISE Program, will build upon our current graduate
program and implement a formal training program in biomedical sciences. A major strength of the proposed
program is our track record in training underrepresented students, and our broad expertise and interests in
biomedicine giving our students a broad offering of approaches to conduct research in biomedicine. Our
primary goal is to competitively train underrepresented students in biomedical sciences, and build a
competitive and inclusive training environment that fosters a positive training experience, and in the long-term,
retention in biomedical sciences. We will require graduate student participation in academic and career
development activities that will enhance their competitive fit for the biomedical workforce. We will continue to
provide high quality research experiences, and enhance their research acumen with core facility training and
R- Suite certification. We will provide support activities to improve scientific writing skills and expect a
significant increase in applications for predoctoral fellowships. We will also strengthen peer-trainee
relationships with learning communities. To ensure a supportive training environment, our mentors will
regularly undergo training in mentorship skills which will create a community of unified expectations for student
outcomes. In the end, we expect predoctoral trainees to transition to biomedical careers and make life-long
contributions to the field. Our current training environment, along with CAU G-RISE, will produce a robust and
competitive program that will produce competitive scientists who are traditionally underrepresented in the field."

 Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are common inborn errors of hepatic metabolism. With improved therapies
such as nitrogen-scavenging agents to prevent elevated ammonia levels, patients with UCDs have increased
survival. However, even in the absence of hyperammonemia, patients with UCDs may have chronic liver
disease. Liver disease in UCDs can manifest as abnormal serum transaminases, hepatomegaly, hepatic
fibrosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Among the UCDs, the highest prevalence of chronic liver disease occurs
in argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD). Importantly, the cause for liver disease in UCDs such as ASLD is
unknown, and liver disease has not been prevented by standard therapies. Moreover, there are no therapeutic
strategies specifically targeting liver disease in ASLD or other UCDs.
 One common histopathologic finding in ASLD and other UCDs is excess hepatic glycogen deposition.
However, the mechanism underlying hepatic glycogen accumulation and its consequences on hepatic function
in UCDs are unknown. Hepatic glycogen deposition is associated with liver disease in glycogen storage
disorders and diabetic glycogenic hepatopathy. Thus, our central hypothesis is that urea cycle dysfunction and
accumulation of ammonia and other toxic metabolites disrupt hepatic energy metabolism, including glycogen
metabolism, and cause liver disease in UCDs. Studies using current mouse models of ASLD and other distal
UCDs have been complicated by the small size and shortened lifespan. To overcome this challenge and
facilitate our proposed studies, we have manipulated mouse models of ASLD and citrullinemia to extend the
lifespan and improve growth. For the proposed studies, we will use biochemical studies, genetic manipulation
and stable isotope studies in these mouse modes to address the following questions: 1) What is the
biochemical basis of hepatic glycogen accumulation in ASLD? 2) Does normalization of hepatic glycogen
levels prevent liver disease in ASLD?
 Insights from these studies have the potential to have significant impact on our understanding of the
relationship between urea cycle dysfunction and hepatic glycogen metabolism. In addition, the results may
inform chronic management strategies for patients with UCDs and may lend insights into new treatment
approaches for this group of disorders. On broader terms, our studies may elucidate mechanisms that
contribute to the regulation of hepatic glucose flux in more common disorders of glucose metabolism."

The proposed Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes using Care
Coordination, Integrated Medical and Behavioral Care and E-Health (LUNA-E) randomized
controlled trial will test the effectiveness of an innovative patient-centered, team-based, primary
care intervention in improving diabetes outcomes in Latino patients of San Ysidro Health (SYH),
a large federally qualified health center (FQHC). The proposal builds on more than 17 years of
research by our academic (San Diego State University; SDSU) community (SYH) partnership.
LUNA-E will recruit and randomize N=400 Latino adults with poorly controlled diabetes into ""usual
care plus"" (UCP) or ""special intervention"" (SI). UCP represents methods recently initiated by the
SYH Patient Centered Medical Home initiative, in which a medical assistant provides care
coordination, referrals, and brief health education in collaboration with the primary care provider.
The LUNA-E SI is a highly integrated, culturally specific for diabetes, team-based approach
informed by the Chronic Care Model of healthcare and Resources and Supports for Self-
Management Model of behavior change. The SI includes: 1) Care Coordination by a specially
trained health navigator; 2) Visits with a Behavioral Health Provider with knowledge of diabetes,
local culture, the integrated model, and psychosocial aspects of diabetes care; 3) Care integration
among the Primary Care Provider, Behavioral Health Provider and Care Coordinator via a clinical
decision support “dashboard” in the patient electronic health record (EHR); 4) Evidence-based,
culturally adapted diabetes self-management education delivered via patient portal. The study will
test hypotheses that the LUNA-E SI will lead to larger improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c
levels; Aim 1) and psychological distress (depression and anxiety symptoms; Aim 2) at 6-months
post randomization when compared to UCP, and the degree to which these differences are
explained by conceptually driven mediators (improved resources and supports for self-
management, patient activation, medication adherence and self-management behaviors; Aim 3)
A matched retrospective True Usual Care (TUC) group (N=200) will be extracted from EHR using
propensity score matching, to evaluate diabetes outcomes in UCP and SI versus patients with
little to no care coordination and health education and no study visits. A thorough process
evaluation will assess intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance (RE-AIM). LUNA-E has excellent potential for high impact and broad dissemination
due to its community partnered approach, reliance on EHR and E-Health, and implementation
within a large, exemplar FQHC primary care environment."
10810862,"Inflammation is designed to destroy, disable, or contain pathogenic invaders, but must be controlled to
avoid destruction of key host systems, like the vasculature. When the interaction between immune cells and
the vasculature goes awry, it can contribute to vascular lesions in aneurysm, atherosclerosis, and other
diseases. Our study of the interactions between innate immune cells and the arterial wall in models of
atherosclerosis – a sterile and chronic injury process with a critical inflammatory component – has revealed
broad regulation of alternative splicing responses that change the extracellular composition of the inflamed
intima and the behavior of recruited immune cells that protect the arterial wall from damage. Guided by
these data and novel in vitro CRISPR screens to probe the function of RNA binding proteins (RBP) in the
regulation endothelial inflammation, we have discovered a set of RBP responsive to innate immune cell
recruitment that are critical in orchestrating the activation of the endothelium through NFkB signaling. Here,
we test the hypothesis that one of these RBP, Elavl1, coordinates alternative splicing in the arterial intima in
response to innate immune cell recruitment to regulate chronic immune functions (Aim 1). In seeking a
deeper understanding of this immune-regulatory system, we made the unexpected discovery that, like
Elavl1, many RBP strongly bind to transposable element (TE) sequences inserted within genes and their
RNA transcripts (p<0.0001). While most TE are inactive, these vestigial TE sequences account for ~45% of
our genome, are found in nearly all genes, and can provide cryptic splice sites in transcripts that depend on
RBP activity. Thus, we aim to define the family of TE-binding RBP, to understand their regulation during
inflammatory responses, and their impact on splicing patterns and inflammatory responses through binding
to TE (Aim 2). The completion of these aims will provide new insight into the contribution of endothelial
alternative splicing responses to inflammation in chronic inflammatory states, and the contribution of
pervasive TE-derived sequence to transcript regulation through RBP that bind them, providing new avenues
to understand and treat chronic inflammation in the cardiovascular system."

 Structural plasticity of neuronal connections is crucial for the wiring and rewiring of
neuronal circuits in response to experience during development and in adulthood. Defects in
plasticity of neuronal connectivity underlie, exacerbate, or contribute to the pathogenesis of many
neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurological disorders, including age-related decline.
However, our understanding of the molecular control of structural plasticity across the lifespan
and in different neuronal contexts is far from complete, in part due to the lack of an experimentally
tractable system to study this complex process at this resolution. The well-defined nervous system
of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal system to identify the genes and molecular
mechanisms involved with direct comparison of multiple life stages. We propose to exploit a
robust model of structural plasticity we discovered in C. elegans to identify and compare
the genetic and molecular regulation of experience-dependent structural plasticity across
development, adulthood, and aging at single neuron resolution. In Aim #1, we will use the
power of C. elegans genetics to screen 20 conserved cell adhesion, scaffolding, and signaling
molecules for roles in experience-dependent structural plasticity during both development and in
early adulthood. Aim #2 will comprehensively characterize the impact of aging on a neuron,
circuit, and behavior in both sexes, and directly measure any changes in the capacity for structural
plasticity across adulthood and aging by inducing and inhibiting structural plasticity with opto- and
chemo-genetic tools. We will identify the mechanisms that maintain or degrade the capacity for
structural plasticity with age, providing novel characterization and understanding of structural
plasticity across the lifespan. In Aim #3, we will leverage the model of experience-dependent
structural plasticity in C. elegans to gain mechanistic insights into the role of multiple conserved
and disease-associated cell adhesion molecules in the regulation of structural plasticity. Using a
combination of transgenic rescue experiments and insertion of tags/tools into the endogenous
CAM genes, we will define the cellular, molecular, and temporal mechanisms by which CAMs
contribute to plasticity. The proposed experiments will directly contribute to our understanding of
the mechanisms and conserved genes that regulate experience-dependent structural plasticity.
thereby informing its role in brain health, disease, and aging, while potentially identifying novel
molecular targets for therapeutic intervention."

Protein prenylation is characterized by the addition of farnesyl (C15) or geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoids to
cysteine residues located near the C-termini of different proteins. Although originally considered to be a rare
modification, it is now clear that protein prenylation is widespread in eucaryotes and is of critical importance for
a variety of proteins involved in oncogenesis, secretion, nuclear structure, and signal transduction. It has been
estimated that as many as 2% of all proteins in mammalian cells are isoprenylated. This prevalence, coupled
with the central role that many of these modified proteins play in cellular signaling, underscores the
significance of this post-translational modification. Prenylation inhibitors were initially developed as therapeutic
agents for cancer treatment. With the development of precision medicine approaches that target specific Ras-
driven cancers, several clinical trials are ongoing. These inhibitors are also being investigated for the treatment
of a wide variety of other disease including malaria, viral infections, Parkinson's disease and progeria.
Two closely linked critical questions in the field of prenylation research concern what proteins are prenylated
and how do they change in disease? What are clearly necessary are global methods that can compare the
prenylomes in normal and disease states and allow those prenylated proteins whose levels change to be
identified. If this were possible, it would reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention in these debilitating
diseases. To address this, new isoprenoid probes for improved metabolic labeling will be synthesized and
methods to decrease sample complexity and improve probe delivery will be developed. These will be utilized in
quantitative proteomic experiments in cell culture and mouse models for disease. Another critical set of
questions is what controls prenylation efficiency and is how is prenylation regulated? To address these
questions, what are needed are strategies that allow the process of protein prenylation to be assayed in real
time in live cells. This would allow prenylation reactions to be studied in a holistic manner in the presence of all
relevant cellular components. It could open also up additional avenues for therapeutic intervention since it
could reveal new regulatory interactions that could be targeted. To accomplish this, cell penetrating peptides
with caged cysteine residues that mask their site of prenylation will be prepared and their subsequent
prenylation monitored via microscopy after uncaging in a temporally controlled manner. Complementary
experiments with full-length proteins, prepared by sortase ligation, containing the same light activated trigger
will be used to explore potential interactions with chaperone proteins that may not be observed with the simpler
peptide-based models."

Niche-derived growth factors (GFs) are essential for establishing and maintaining mammalian
spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in the adult testis. In culture, however, optimal conditions for
expansion of pure populations of self-renewing SSCs remain elusive. We recently found that
mouse SSCs possess unexpectedly robust mechanisms to counter-regulate GF signaling by
inducing expression of negative feedback regulators (NFRs), including members of the Spry
and Dusp gene families. Abrogation of specific NFRs in SSCs led to increase ERK signaling,
decreased expression of stem cell-associated genes in vitro and loss of stem cell activity upon
transplantation, suggesting that excessive GF-dependent signaling is detrimental to SSC
function and may favor differentiation. The cellular alterations that occur following perturbation
of NFRs are unknown. However, our data imply that SSCs are programmed to limit ERK
signaling within a narrow physiological range. This proposal addresses the mechanisms by
which NFRs restrict GF signaling in SSCs, prevent unscheduled differentiation, and enable
long-term propagation of SSC clones. Using genetic mouse models, SSC culture,
transplantation analysis, and a newly-developed real-time biosensor for ERK activity, we
address the following questions: (1) Which NFRs are required for SSC self-renewal? (2) How
does ablation of NFRs result in loss of stem cell activity? (3) How do NFRs control the dynamic
intracellular signaling cascades downstream of GF receptors? And (4) At which nodes in the
ERK pathway do NFRs exert their actions? In addition to providing a rational basis to improve
SSC culture systems, these studies will also identify novel adult SSC markers and shed light on
mechanisms by which cross-talk between the niche and SSCs balances self-renewal and
differentiation in vivo."

The proposed Training Grant in Genetics is the centerpiece in efforts to provide postdoctoral research training
in medical genetics in the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Genetics Training Program (HMSGTP) with an overall
goal to train future academic leaders of this discipline. The requested number of trainees per year is eight, and
these individuals comprise physicians and Ph.D.s undertaking medical genetics research. Physicians will join
the training program largely with experience in a variety of medical specialties, having done residency training
in a relevant discipline or enrolled in ACGME combined residency programs with medical genetics and genomics
(MGG). Ph.D.s may be appointed after completing training in ACGME MGG laboratory specialties or training in
laboratories pursuing foundational research in human genetics. The ACGME programs may lead to ABMGG
board certification. Advances in genetics and genomics, in particular the sequencing of the human genome, have
dramatically accelerated the pace of research in this area. Genetics and genomics are currently major drivers of
medical research and are leading to advances in diagnosis and treatment of both rare and common disorders.
Implementation of the many advances in genetics requires a well-educated, diverse and talented workforce of
genetics professionals. This Training Grant in Genetics has made possible training of physicians and scientists
in a wide variety of topics in medical genetics, enabling them to take advantage of the extraordinarily rich
academic environment present at HMS and its affiliated institutions as well as the greater Boston scientific
community notably including the Broad Institute. In addition, it has served to promote interactions between
medical geneticists and investigators and provided a forum for increasing faculty contact with trainees in didactic
sessions. Training laboratories of the HMSGTP have historically been centered now for five decades at HMS
and its affiliated institutions including Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), the HMS Department of Genetics,
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), Dana Farber Cancer Institute
(DFCI), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and also include laboratories at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and the Broad Institute. Since the last renewal of this training grant, an ever enlarging variety
of opportunities in genomic medicine have developed to enhance the focus of training in medical and human
genetics, and the program is fully integrated in HMSGTP, accredited by the ACGME in Clinical Genetics and
subspecialties of Medical Biochemical Genetics and Molecular Genetic Pathology and combined training with
Clinical Genetics leading to dual board certification (Internal Medicine/MGG, Pediatrics/MGG, Maternal-Fetal
Medicine/MGG, with an application underway for training in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility/MGG),
Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, providing the opportunity for trainees to
become active candidates for certification in a discipline(s) of medical genetics in addition to receiving research
training for two to three years."

Alzheimer’s disease is devastating for individuals and society. Impaired learning and memory, particularly in the
context of spatial navigation, is one of its early and major symptoms. Similarly, rodents recapitulating aspects of
Alzheimer’s disease also exhibit early impairments in spatial navigation. A preponderance of evidence suggests
abnormal cortical-hippocampal communication in humans with Alzheimer’s disease. Hippocampal-cortical
interactions during sleep are thought to be critical for consolidation of newly acquired memories. However, no studies
have assessed these brain dynamics during sleep in rodents modeling Tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation aspects
of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the proposed research will explore the functionality of brain dynamics during sleep
in the hippocampal-PC network in animal models of Tau and Aβ aggregation (TAβA). To do this, we will use a
triple transgenic mouse where three major genes associated with familial Alzheimer’s disease are expressed
leading to TAβA. This mouse model mimics plaque and tangle pathological hallmarks of the disease, with a
distribution pattern similar to human patients, including synaptic changes in the limbic system. In addition, all
findings will be confirmed in a transgenic rat with Aβ accumulation, plaque formation, tau accumulation, cell loss,
and spatial memory impairments. Specifically, we will: 1) assess the relationship between spatial learning and
memory, as well as brain dynamics during sleep, both within and across the hippocampus and cortex; 2) use a
novel targeted optogenetic approach to functionally dissect the relative contributions of TAβA in the
hippocampus to impaired hippocampal-cortical coupling during sleep and impaired spatial learning. 3) test the
efficacy of a non-invasive visual stimulation approach, known for clearing cortical TAβA, to relieve impaired
hippocampal-cortical coupling during sleep and impaired spatial learning. This project will provide insight into
the normal function of a circuit that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease and allow us to probe dysfunction in
this circuit that emerges in very early stages of disease progression in rodents modeling TAβA aspects of
Alzheimer’s disease. This research will allow us to begin understanding changes in this network which may
underlie the emergence of cognitive impairments observed in Alzheimer’s disease and begin testing the efficacy
of a non-invasive treatment for reversing the functional brain abnormalities and impaired cognition."

Caspase-4/-5/-11 non-canonical inflammasomes have been known to play pivotal roles in various inflammatory
and infectious diseases, such as sepsis. Current studies demonstrate that caspase-4/-5/-11 are activated by
directly sensing intracellular microbial infections, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also known as endotoxin), or
endogenous products, such as oxidized phospholipids (e.g., OxPAPC), through their N-terminal caspase
activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) and C-terminal catalytic domains, respectively. However, the
molecular mechanisms of how caspase-4/-5/-11 recognize their ligands and how caspase-4/-5/-11 are activated
upon binding ligands remain unknown. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the structural basis of non-canonical
inflammasome signaling by characterizing the interactions between caspase-4/-5/-11 and ligands - LPS and
OxPAPC, and determining the high-resolution structures of caspase/-4/-5/-11 in complex with ligands. Our
structural findings will provide new therapeutic strategies for sepsis and other non-canonical inflammasome-
associated diseases. We propose three specific aims to achieve our goal: 1) Biochemical characterization of the
interactions between caspase-4/-5/-11 and LPS-including the identification of the essential structural elements
in the LPS molecule and key residues on caspase-4/-5/-11 CARDs that are required for caspase-4/-5/-11
activation; 2) Determine high-resolution structures of caspase-4/-5/-11 CARDs both in their inactive form and in
complex with LPS; 3) Characterize the interactions between caspase-4/-11 and OxPAPC, and determine the
high resolution structures of caspase-4/-11 catalytic domains in complex with OxPAPC. We will pursue these
aims using cutting-edge experimental approaches including biochemical and biophysical characterization, X-ray
crystallography, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and cellular experiments. The proposed studies will
significantly expand our current knowledge on the mechanisms of non-canonical inflammasome signaling, and
provide rationale and a structural basis for designing novel strategies to control the activation of the non-
canonical inflammasome for better treatment of related diseases."

 The overall aim of this application is to advance PfCDPK5 and PfGARP as vaccine candidates for
falciparum malaria. P.falciparum malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more
than 500,000 deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality
rate because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited
success, and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent, unmet need to
discover new vaccine candidates. A vaccine against childhood malaria is a priority because children below the
age of 5 years are highly vulnerable to the disease. In recent studies, our laboratory discovered Schizont
Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kDa-parasite antigen that is crucial for parasite egress from an infected red
blood cell (iRBC), which was published as a comprehensive, full-length Research Article in Science.
 In a parallel approach, we have screened phage display cDNA libraries constructed from parasites
isolated at our Tanzanian field site with/without culture adaptation using positive selection with antibodies
pooled from resistant two-year-olds and negative selection with antibodies pooled from susceptible children.
We identified several independent cDNA clones encoding plasmodium falciparum glutamic acid reach protein
(PfGARP) and plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase (PfCDPK5) that were uniquely recognized by
antibodies in resistant, but not susceptible sera. Our preliminary data demonstrate that PfGARP and PfCDPK5
is critical for parasite development in side RBC and egress respectively). PfGARP expresses on the surface of
the trophozoite infected RBC and PfCDPK5 is expressed by merozoites as they rupture from erythrocytes.
Antibodies against PfGARP and PfCDPK5 block parasite growth up to 99% in vitro, and ortholog vaccine of
CDPK5 protect mice from parasitemia, and extend the survival of mice challenged with lethal P. berghei ANKA.
 Our vaccine discovery program has also identified several known invasion ligands (MSP-4 and MSP-7
collectively referred to as MSPs) In this application, we will evaluate these vaccine candidates with CDPK5 as
single fusion protein (PfCDPK5-MSP4 & PfCDPK5-MSP7) in combination with PfGARP in in vitro assays and
using multiple adjuvant systems in murine vaccine trials. The lead fusion antigen will be further evaluated for
cell mediated immune response using TFRS depletion method in murine model. The deliverables from this study
will be an adjuvant optimized tri-valent vaccine ready for Aotus/ P. falciparum challenge and Phase-1 clinical
trial in human that targets the entry, intracellular development, and the exit of the parasite cycle in ."

21 of our pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees, respectively, are currently active in academic/research-intensive
22 careers, with 77% of our post-doctoral trainees currently employed in academic research careers. Of the 37
23 post-doctoral trainees who were supported by this training grant before 2014, 54% report being PI on a research
24 grant (54%), almost all of whom have a faculty rank of Assistant Professor or higher. These data demonstrate

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is neurodegenerative movement disorder that causes a series of motor deficits. Due
to the degenerative nature of PD, effective management of motor symptoms requires frequent and accurate
motor assessment. Current approaches for PD motor assessment rely on subjectively rated clinical scales or
research-grade equipment that is expensive or data-limited. These limitations significantly restrict the ability to
perform frequent, granular assessments of motor function and highlight an important need for new approaches
that enable objective motor assessments in any setting with minimal costs of time, money, or effort.
Here, we propose an automated, video-based approach to PD motor assessment by using a state of the art
pose estimation algorithm. Briefly, pose estimation is an emerging technology that is capable of quantitatively
tracking human movement from simple digital videos recorded using common household devices (e.g.,
smartphones, tablets). The development of pose estimation algorithms for tracking human movement has
progressed rapidly in the artificial intelligence community, and there is now significant untapped potential for
leveraging this technology to perform rapid, automated motor assessments directly in home or clinic.
In Aim 1.1, we will test a pose estimation approach for gait assessment in persons with PD. Gait dysfunction is
common in PD, but it remains difficult to assess gait quantitatively in the home or clinic. Gait assessment is not
represented adequately in clinical scales of motor function in PD, and there are no good methods for objective
measurement of whole-body gait kinematics that can be used directly in the home or clinic. We will address
this need by using a video-based pose estimation workflow to perform gait assessments in persons with PD.
We will compare these results to motion capture measurements to examine how well the pose estimation
approach approximates ground-truth measurements.
In Aim 1.2, we will use our pose estimation approach to track repetitive movements in persons with PD. PD
often causes difficulty in performing repetitive movements (e.g., finger tapping); accordingly, assessment of
repetitive movements constitutes a significant portion of the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(the standard clinical scale for motor assessment in PD). This assessment is done through subjective human
ratings; here, we will test an automated, objective, video-based approach for tracking repetitive movements in
persons with PD and again compare to ground-truth motion capture measurements.
In Aim 2, we will compare and contrast motor deficits identified by pose estimation and human assessment.
Subjective visual assessment is the most common means of assessing motor function in PD, but computer
vision approaches (e.g., pose estimation) have significant potential to automate and objectivize this process.
Here, we will compare how well deficits in gait and repetitive movements detected by our pose estimation
approach align with neurologist ratings of these tasks on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale."

Significance. Cannabis use is increasing exponentially among older US adults (≥65 years), a population that is
expected to comprise over 20% of the population in coming decades. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to
cognitive impairment associated with cannabis use, and demonstrate increasingly heterogeneous patterns of
cannabis use (including cannabis use histories and current use profiles). Consequently, this rapidly growing
population of cannabis users will become a public health concern in coming years and merit preventive and
therapeutic interventions. Extant information on cannabis use patterns and their associations with cognitive
impairment is lacking in this critically understudied population. This research proposal examines associations
between a range of cannabis use measures and cognitive impairment, particularly residual impairment (i.e.,
cognitive effects observed after acute intoxication has passed), in older adult cannabis users. Career
Development Plan. Dr. Livne’s training program will include coursework and mentorship to develop his skills
and expertise in survey design, aging and cognition-related research, and generalized linear modeling, causal
modeling and longitudinal analyses. These are necessary for achieving his career goals of becoming an
independent investigator performing impactful research on the intersection between cannabis use, cognition,
and the aging population. Mentorship. Dr. Livne’s will be supported by a highly accomplished team of mentors
who are experts in substance use epidemiology, biostatistics, aging, and cognition. Research Plan. For Aim 1,
Dr. Livne will use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large nationally representative study of older US
adults, to examine associations between cannabis use predictors and domain-specific cognitive impairment,
including residual impairment, among adults ≥65 years. For Aim 2a, Dr. Livne will recruit a large online sample
of older adults via social media platforms, to describe cannabis use patterns (i.e., cannabis use histories, current
profiles of use) and examine the associations between such patterns. For Aim 2b, Dr. Livne will conduct a pilot
study of a subset of respondents from the online sample as well as sociodemographically comparable older
adults with no lifetime cannabis use. Using self-administered neuropsychological assessments, he will assess
the feasibility of integrating cognitive tests in online samples of older adults and provide preliminary data on
associations between detailed measures of cannabis use patterns and domain-specific residual cognitive
impairment, expanding on analyses from Aim 1. Public Health Impact. This project will illuminate patterns of
cannabis use and associated cognitive impairment among older adults, thus informing clinicians, researchers,
and policymakers of individual and public health risks in a growing yet understudied cannabis user population.
Subsequently, findings will inform the development of harm reduction strategies and the feasibility of utilizing
online research tools for cost-effective cognitive assessment of older adult substance users."

This resubmission is for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award entitled “The Gut
Microbiome in Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Colonization, Persistence, Infection, and
Tolerance after Lung or Liver Transplantation.” I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Transplant Infectious
Diseases physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). I require additional training to develop
expertise as a translational researcher. My objective is to study the genetic characteristics of CRE that cause
gut colonization, persistence, and infection after lung/liver transplant, the phenomenon of tolerance in CRE, and
the gut microbiota environment associated with these events. My preliminary data suggest that (1) lung/liver
transplant recipients are at high risk for CRE colonization, with a subset developing persistent CRE colonization
and recurrent infections months to years after transplant, (2) last resort antibiotics like ceftazidime-avibactam
can induce tolerance in CRE in vitro, and (3) rectal CRE colonization after lung/liver transplant is associated with
marked dysbiosis and predominance of Proteobacteria. The scientific premise of this study is that long-term
CRE colonization after lung/liver transplant is a result of persistence of antibiotic-tolerant CRE isolates
that colonize the gut early after transplant, a process which is associated with a reduction in stool
diversity and abundance of Proteobacteria and maintained by ongoing dysbiosis. To test this central
hypothesis, I will be pursuing the following specific aims: (1a) to genetically characterize longitudinal CRE
isolates from these patients; (1b) to study antibiotic tolerance and resistance after exposure of these CRE to the
CRE-active antibiotics ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, cefiderocol,
and colistin; (1c) to identify risk factors for CRE colonization after lung/liver transplant; (2a) to determine whether
post-transplant stool microbiome profiles can predict future CRE colonization; and (2b and 2c) to define the stool
microbiota environment in which CRE colonization, persistence, and infection occur. This project will provide
novel insights into the genomic epidemiology and gut microbiome of lung/liver transplant recipients through the
entire spectrum of CRE colonization and disease. The proposed work will be conducted within the Division of
Infectious Diseases at UPMC and the Center for Medicine at the Microbiome at the University of Pittsburgh,
which have the computational and technical expertise required for bacterial genomic studies and microbial and
metagenomic sequencing. I am supported by committed mentors with complementary expertise in transplant
infectious diseases, Gram-negative resistance, microbiome research, and biostatistics. I will obtain a Certificate
in Clinical Research and receive didactic and hands-on training in microbiome and genomics research. Through
my training plan and aims, I will acquire the skillset required to perform translational studies of drug-resistant
bacteria in solid organ transplant recipients and interventional microbiome trials in these patients."

 Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is structured and planned, with a goal to increase fitness. Regular
exercise is associated with slower declines in Parkinson’s-related mobility outcomes and quality of life. However,
fewer than half of people with Parkinson’s disease (PwP) achieve recommended levels of exercise. Exercise
barriers include lowknowledge and expectations of the benefits, mobility concerns, and lack of time or convenient
exercise options. Research is needed to determine how to facilitate exercise initiation, progression, and
maintenance in PwP and those with other disabilities or chronic conditions.
 Physical therapy (PT) is a healthcare service that can help PwP and other conditions to address personal
and environmental barriers to exercise. We have successfully piloted a Consultative PT program to help PwP to
increase and maintain their exercise and physical function. We distinguish Consultative PT from traditional PT
by using fewer, less frequent visits. Additionally, Consultative PT focuses on exercise promotion in the presence
of minimal or stable functional deficits, rather than brief but intense episodes of PT for functional gains. However,
referral to Consultative PT challenges traditional perceptions of PT as a treatment for mobility problems. The
proposed effectiveness-implementation hybrid type II study will systematically evaluate Consultative PT in two
dissimilar contexts to inform effective sustainment, equitable spread to other Parkinson’s programs, and future
scaling to other populations that can benefit from exercise monitoring and maintenance.
 First, we will use mixed effects regression models to evaluate differences in 12-month physical activity
trajectories between individuals enrolled during periods of (1) standard care, (2) written exercise guidance from
neurologists, and (3) ConsultativePT (Aim1). We will enroll 96 PwP per group. We hypothesize that Consultative
PT will help PwP improve and maintain exercise participation, controlling for disease-specific factors and social
determinants of health. Second, we will contrast consultative PT implementation determinants, strategies,
outcomes, and sustainment between organizations in two dissimilar communities (Aim 2). We will study
determinants at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and community levels. We hypothesize that
facilitated implementation will lead to similar fidelity, adoption, acceptability, and appropriateness between
organizations, but that the lower-resourced community will experience challenges to reach and sustainment.
 This proposal is responsive to the National Institutes of Health notice of special interest on developing and
testing multilevel physical activity interventions (NOT-OD-21-087). Additionally, the proposed project addresses
the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute on Child Health and Human Development’s research theme to
advance safe and effective therapeutic interventions for people with disabilities. Targeting two dissimilar
communities will facilitate the equity of the current and future work to help us optimize abilities for all."

pharmacologists, including women and underrepresented minorities, who have assumed prominent roles in
academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies. Qualified applicants have always filled the
training grant slots. In fact, we receive substantially more qualified applicants than available positions. Our
program is accredited by the American Board of Clinical Pharmacology. Because the Division of Clinical
Pharmacology at Indiana University has a long and distinguished record of excellence in training leaders in
clinical pharmacology and translational therapeutics and our training program currently represents one of the
strongest, most comprehensive, and cutting-edge training, we are in a unique position to successfully continue
training outstanding future leaders in the discipline."
10766793,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Prostate organogenesis starts prior to birth, with extensive tissue growth occurring during puberty in response
to androgens after the immune system is fully functional. Androgens are generally considered immune-
suppressive, so this suggests contradictory roles for immune cells in the prostate, where an immune suppressive
microenvironment is needed as new prostate-specific proteins are generated, yet immune cell functions are
required to promote morphogenesis and tissue growth during puberty. Our recent single-cell RNA sequencing
analyses of normal mouse and human prostates revealed previously unknown heterogeneity in prostate
epithelial cell types. These studies form the foundation for a new direction in which I propose to shift my focus
from prostate epithelial cells to investigate the function, developmental origins, and androgen-dependence of
immune cells in the prostate. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate immune cell regulation of
prostate organogenesis so that we can better understand the underpinnings of benign prostate disease. This
application specifically seeks to elucidate the function of macrophages during prostate organogenesis and their
potential contribution to BPH progression. Our central hypothesis is that heterogeneous populations of prostate
macrophages with distinct cellular origins and tissue-specific properties regulate the organogenesis and function
of the prostate, and their dysregulation contributes to BPH. To test our hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 will identify
the function and heterogeneity of macrophages in the developing prostate. Specific Aim 2 will determine the
cellular origins of macrophages in the developing prostate and in BPH. Specific Aim 3 will identify the androgen
signaling requirements of macrophage populations in the developing prostate and in BPH. Under Aim 1, we will
conduct immunofluorescence analysis of macrophages in prostate tissues, incorporating high-resolution 3D
imaging, live imaging, and data from single-cell RNA sequencing. For Aim 2, we will conduct genetic-lineage
tracing studies of macrophages of yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow origin. For Aim 3, we will test the role
of AR in prostate macrophages by deleting AR in macrophages during prostate organogenesis and in a mouse
model of BPH. This proposal is innovative due to the novel investigation into how immune cells contribute to
promoting prostate organogenesis both prior to and during puberty in this androgen-regulated organ; the novel
investigation into how AR functions in prostate immune cells to regulate organ morphogenesis and immune
suppression during puberty; and the use of innovative technology. The proposed research is significant because
successful completion of this proposal will elucidate the in vivo function of macrophages during prostate
organogenesis; demonstrate the cellular origin of prostate macrophages across the various stages of prostate
organogenesis; and clarify the in vivo role of cell-autonomous AR in macrophages during prostate
organogenesis. Importantly, this project will further investigate the role of macrophages in the development of
BPH, which has the potential to inform the development of improved treatment strategies for BPH."
10816376,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) proposal establishes a Center for Rural Health
Care Delivery Science at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health (D-HH), one of the most rural academic medical centers
in the United States. Nearly 20% of Americans live in non-metropolitan areas and experience poorer health
outcomes, but research on rural health care has been limited by challenges associated with relatively small
and geographically dispersed populations. Accordingly, our Center will concentrate on understanding and
solving challenges associated with the provision of health care in rural areas, focusing on a community-
engaged approach to research. The overarching goal of this COBRE is to establish a multidisciplinary research
program in rural health care delivery science and to provide expert mentorship and infrastructure to train and
support a critical mass of early-career clinician-scientists as they transition into independent researchers
dedicated to decreasing health care disparities in rural communities. To achieve this goal, the Center will
pursue the following four specific aims: (1) Integrate research expertise, mentorship, and community
engagement to establish a Center for Rural Health Care Delivery Science; (2) Enhance the transition of early-
career clinician-scientists into independent researchers through strong research support and dedicated
mentoring; (3) Assure accountability and achievement of milestones through the implementation of a rigorous
program evaluation plan; and (4) Leverage shared resources to support the Center for Rural Health Care
Delivery Science as a self-sustaining scientific community. The proposed Center will bring an innovative and
impactful approach to rural health care delivery research by focusing on the fundamental causes of rural health
disparities across systems and processes, as well as addressing barriers that impede disease detection,
access to care, and management of health conditions that are particularly prevalent in rural populations. The
initial four Research Project Leaders will address disease prevention and screening (Project 1), digital health
technologies for disease management (Project 2), as well as socio-economic factors and health policy that
impact the management of complex conditions (Project 3) and the provision of end-of-life care (Project 4). The
Center's Scientific Cores will support the Center by: (1) Strengthening methodology for mechanistic studies in
rural populations; and (2) Providing needed resources for expanding and strengthening critical relationships
between researchers and key stakeholders via community-based participatory research. COBRE funding,
coupled with substantial institutional funding and a commitment to hire additional faculty members during
Phase I, will provide an outstanding foundation for the development of a vibrant Center. In summary, the
proposed Center will support the establishment of a self-sustaining, multidisciplinary research program in rural
health care delivery science at D-HH."
10763043,"ABSTRACT
Methamphetamine (meth) is an addictive psychostimulant. Our pilot studies show that chronic meth resulted in
degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) and locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine
(NE) but not ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA or dorsal raphe (DR) serotonin (5-HT) neurons in mice. DA, NE,
and 5-HT are monoamine neurotransmitters synthesized and packaged into vesicles in axonal compartments.
Meth increases cytosolic monoamines and MAO-dependent mitochondrial stress in SNc axons but not the soma.
Pilot studies show that MAO inhibition prevented meth-induced SNc degeneration. These data suggest that
degeneration is driven by MAO-dependent axonal mitochondrial stress. However, pilot data show meth also
increased LC, VTA, and DR axonal mitochondrial stress yet chronic meth induced SNc and LC but not VTA or
DR degeneration. We found L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC)-dependent mitochondrial stress in SNc but not VTA
axons. We propose a `two-hit' hypothesis wherein both MAO- and LCC-dependent axonal mitochondrial stress
are required for degeneration. The degeneration `trigger' is meth-induced MAO-dependent axonal mitochondrial
stress and vulnerability is a consequence of axonal LCC-dependent mitochondrial stress. Since MAO- and LCC-
dependent stress converge in axons, we propose that axonal loss precedes somatic loss in a `dying-back' pattern
of degeneration. Pilot data indicate that SNc axonal mitochondrial stress was increased during abstinence. We
hypothesize this stress is MAO-dependent and contributes to degeneration during abstinence. Lastly, meth-
induced degeneration is expected to impair novel object recognition and fear conditioning which are dependent
on DA and NE, respectively. Hypotheses will be tested using two-photon laser scanning microscopy in brain
slices, genetically encoded biosensors, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of MAO/LCCs, and
immunohistochemistry. Aim 1: Determine mechanisms of mitochondrial stress in monoaminergic axons,
consequences of chronic meth on mitochondria, and whether mitochondrial stress continues during
abstinence. We hypothesize that SNc, VTA, LC, and DR axons all have meth-induced MAO-dependent
mitochondrial stress whereas SNc and LC but not VTA or DR axons will have LCC-induced mitochondrial stress.
We also hypothesize that axonal stress will remain elevated throughout abstinence from chronic meth and will
be MAO-dependent. Aim 2: Determine the roles of MAO and LCCs in chronic meth-induced degeneration
and behavioral consequences. We hypothesize that pharmacologically inhibiting or genetically deleting MAO
or LCCs will prevent chronic meth-induced degeneration of vulnerable (SNc and LC) neurons and deleting the
Ca2+ buffering protein calbindin from resistant (VTA and DR) neurons will render them vulnerable to
degeneration. We further hypothesize that degeneration will be progressive throughout abstinence and MAO-
dependent. Lastly, we hypothesize that SNc and LC degeneration will result in cognitive impairments."
10771961,"Project Summary/Abstract
Population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to healthcare are
termed “health disparities” and they are a significant concern in our society. Lack of representation of the
underserved groups—which includes minorities, financially disadvantaged, and disabled individuals—in the
biomedical research and healthcare workforce has been identified as a critical factor underlying health
disparities. Indeed, disparities in the demographics of individuals entering careers in biomedical research are
well documented. Biomedical knowledge and healthcare will benefit from broader inclusion of
underrepresented individuals engaged in biomedical research as inclusive research teams have broader
perspectives in setting research agendas, can more effectively recruit diverse subjects into clinical research
studies, and work more effectively to deliver healthcare and reduce health disparities. Experiential learning by
active engagement in research is an effective way to nurture the next generation of scientists and health care
researchers. Veterinarians conduct research important to human health through comparative studies and
animal models; unfortunately the racial and ethnic diversity in the veterinary profession is no better than that of
the biomedical research workforce in general. Thus, this proposal is designed to recruit and comprehensively
immerse both undergraduate and veterinary medical students from underrepresented groups in summer
research experiences on the campus of Michigan State University. These research experiences will be focused
on three major areas: hypertension, airway disease and blood cells and components in tissue pathology. The
objective of our education research program is to increase the number of students from underrepresented
groups who pursue biomedical research-related educational goals and career paths relevant to the mission
areas of the NHLBI. The strategy to meet this objective involves 1) providing student participants an
immersive research experience that exposes them to the various aspects of a research career, 2) cultivating
participants' science identity by facilitating the development of mentor and peer networks, and creating a
community that supports the participants' research-related interests, and 3) fostering the participants'
successes so as to give them the confidence needed to pursue a research-related career. This strategy will be
implemented through the following specific aims: (1) engage undergraduate and veterinary medical students
in high-quality mentored research in the areas of heart, lung, and blood diseases; (2) provide comprehensive
exposure to the various aspects of biomedical research through an organized program of activities; (3) bolster
the trainees' understanding of the critical concepts of responsible conduct of research; (4) recruit trainees from
populations underrepresented in the biomedical sciences; and (5) conduct comprehensive evaluations to
determine the effectiveness of our programming in enhancing diversity in health-related biomedical research."
10764796,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients who have undergone hippocampal resection to treat mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) frequently
experience memory deficits. Clinicians have few tools to preview these deficits when planning surgeries; the
Wada test, which anesthetizes each hemisphere to test memory function available in the contralateral
hemisphere, is the current medical standard. It was developed when temporal lobectomy was the primary
surgical treatment for MTLE. In contrast, modern surgical techniques such as open selective
amygdalohippocampectomy (AH) and laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) enable precise, selective lesions
while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue. The difference in scale between the preview and the resection
is one variable contributing to inconsistency in the utility of the Wada test to accurately preview memory deficits.
Clinicians need a test which more precisely targets the tissue to be removed, and thus more accurately predicts
functional consequences of losing the tissue. We propose using electrical stimulation (ES) through
stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) depth electrodes, placed in the hippocampus for clinical seizure
monitoring, to generate temporary memory deficits at the spatial scale of intended surgical resection. Although
ES of the hippocampus has been frequently employed to study the hippocampus' role in memory processes, its
clinical utility to preview the memory deficits after hippocampectomy is less studied. Because the Wada test
remains the clinical standard, we have designed our study to match its testing paradigm. Within this framework,
our proposal will study where (Aim 1), when (Aim 2), and how (Aim 3) to stimulate the hippocampus to produce
memory impairment. While the involvement of the hippocampus in memory function is undisputed, it is not clear
which subregion(s) of the hippocampus should be stimulated to impair memory function. We believe stimulating
both the head and body of the hippocampus will lead to impairment, but in Aim 1 we will also test stimulation of
the head and body individually to see whether more localized stimulation can produce the desired effect.
Similarly, the hippocampus has been implicated in both encoding and retrieval memory processes, but it is not
known which of these processes should be disrupted by ES to impair memory function. In Aim 2 we will test
stimulation in these phases individually and in both phases to determine which leads to the best impairment.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will examine how the frequency of stimulation affects impairment of memory function. The
literature reports studies using a wide range of frequencies, from 5 to 200 Hz. Because higher frequencies are
more likely to generate epileptic activity, we limit our testing to a lower range of frequencies. We will evaluate ES
at 5 Hz, which matches endogenous neurophysiological modulation within the hippocampus, and 50 Hz, which
has long been a clinical standard used to disrupt function throughout neural tissue. This proposal, a new research
direction, will establish the baseline results needed to translate ES of the hippocampus into a clinically viable
tool to preview memory deficits resulting from resection of the hippocampus in the treatment of MTLE."

The G-RISE at New Mexico State University (G-RISE@NMSU) program mission is to train PhD candidates
to become biomedical, biobehavioral, and/or bioengineering scientists prepared for leadership in the
workforce through ethical, safe, innovative, and interdisciplinary practices. Over the past 21 years, RISE at
NMSU has diversified the community of health scientists by supporting PhD degree completion for 51 NMSU
students who are underrepresented across all racial, ethnic, and minority groups. Much of the impact that
RISE has made is because of NMSU's unique status as a doctoral, research-intensive (NIH- INBRE), land
grant, minority (Hispanic) serving university with a diverse student population and a cadre of accomplished
mentors. Key outcomes of the 21-year NMSU RISE research education program are: 80.1% retention to
science careers after NMSU PhD completion; 93.4% retention to degree completion by NMSU PhDstudents;
student-authored publications; achievement of student independent support; national recognition for student
research excellence; and student entry to postdoctoral positions in R1 institutions. This new G-RISE@NMSU
application requests funds to train twelve PhD graduate scholars for the first 2-3 years of their graduate
program. Our planned program will enable completion of a PhD by >90% of the PhD scholars and their
subsequent entry to the biomedical research workforce. Trainees will be mentored in research, professional
development activities, formal courses on ethics, safety, reproducibility, and in scientific workshops that
develop cutting edge quantitative and technical skills. Mentors will be trained in how resilience and
microagressions impact URM student success and that the diversity-innovation paradox factors into their
leadership in science. Three developmental activities are planned to provide core skills to prepare students
for success in different scientific fields and careers: Activity 1: LEAD-IDEA Courses develops the research,
safety,communication and ethics skills that maximize responsible research productivity, funding success, and
degree completion in 5 years; Activity 2, START-UP (Student Training and Research through United
Partnerships) Program provides scientific and technical workshops on leadership, diversity & inclusion,
problem solving, mentoring, and metacognition. Finally, the career development programs provide employer
interaction activities and career readiness through didactic and experiential programs."
10773064,"The goal of this proposal is to determine how antigen exposure shapes subsequent Natural Killer cell
responses to HIV. We propose to identify NK functional subsets in naïve and antigen-primed human NK cells
using single-cell sequencing and multi-parametric flow cytometry. We propose to verify the relevance of
such functional subsets to NK cell-mediated host protection from HIV disease using our established in vitro
and in vivo functional assays. NK cells are innate lymphocytes that live up to their name by their ability to kill
infected or tumor cells within minutes of exposure. However, the targeting of NK cell effector functions has not
been a significant focus in vaccine development, which has mainly focused on their T and B cell counterparts
in the adaptive immune system. Recent findings from the PI of this application indicate that NK cells deserve
more attention. We recently published exciting new data that human NK cells remember prior antigen-
encounters and mediate enhanced recall responses to HIV-Envelope in humanized mice. Here, we present
unpublished new data that HIV-Env-primed memory NK cells suppress HIV viral titers upon experimental viral
challenge. These findings have opened the opportunity to harness NK memory functions for vaccine design.
However, high NK cell receptor repertoire diversity is associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition,
and NK cell receptor repertoires diversify throughout life, presumably in response to antigen exposure.
These data present a challenge for vaccine design, as both protective NK memory responses and potentially
risky NK repertoire diversifications are consequences of antigen exposure. The identification of specific
functional subsets of HIV-responsive, host-protective NK cells and their mechanisms of host protection is
therefore critically needed. Their discovery will open the door for revised vaccine designs that endure the
incorporation of NK memory, rather than harmful receptor repertoire diversity, as a host protective outcome.
Our data will enable the pre-screening of vaccines for the induction of protective NK functional subsets in pre-
clinical models and allow for improved vaccine efficacy evaluations in humans. Thereby, our studies will
provide the rationale to develop novel vaccines that exploit the antiviral activity of NK cells to protect humans
from HIV infection while avoiding harmful activity."
10775699,"Abstract
Unsupervised cluster analysis has been widely applied to omics data analysis for identifying molecular disease
subtypes, which may present distinct disease prognosis and/or unique underlying disease mechanism. The
findings can ultimately establish foundations for precision medicine. Existing disease subtyping methods in the
literature are, however, purely unsupervised. The identified disease subtypes are often irrelevant to clinical
outcome and cannot be translated into clinical practice. We hypothesize that an outcome-guided molecular
disease subtyping framework with systematic integration of multi-omics data, clinical information and biological
pathway knowledge will generate disease relevant and clinically actionable subtypes towards precision medicine.
The developed methods are expected to be applicable for a wide range of complex diseases, where disease
subtyping may be instrumental for finding novel therapeutic targets or improving treatment decisions. The
specific aims are: (1) Develop outcome-guided clustering (OG-Clust) framework for disease subtyping using a
single omics dataset. (2) Develop outcome-guided clustering (OG-Clust) framework for integrating multiple omics
datasets. (3) Application and validation in breast cancer and pediatric asthma."

There is extensive evidence that economic and social stressors shape the development of cardiovascular
disease starting early in the life course. However, it is largely unknown how social and economic stressors
affect biological processes, particularly at the cellular level and whether these processes are evident
among children and adolescents. Latinos, the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the
United States, have a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and experience higher rates of poverty
and social stressors in both childhood and adulthood compared to other racial/ethnic groups. One novel
method to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying the associations between stressors and
cardiovascular health across the life course is DNA methylation. Recently a handful of small studies have
found that stressful experiences may alter DNA methylation, thus providing a potential mechanism by
which social stressors may get under the skin. We propose to examine the association between social
stressors, in relation to DNA methylation, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and cardiometabolic health,
among children participating in the Hispanic Community Health Study /Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Youth
Study. The HCHS/SOL Youth study is a study of US Latinos, representing varied countries of origin,
conducted in the US. We propose to use existing data from 1200 participants who completed the HCH/SOL
Youth study and who provided blood samples. Existing blood samples will be assayed for DNA methylation
age, genome-wide methylation and a mtDNA damage marker. Cardiometabolic health markers (obesity,
diabetes, hypertension, inflammation and lipids) have also been assessed. Existing data also includes
assessments of current family environment as well as socio-cultural factors among children. Specifically,
we will examine 1) whether social and economic stressors are associated with DNA methylation age,
mtDNA damage and genome-wide methylation; 2) whether DNA methylation age, genome-wide
methylation and mtDNA damage is associated with cardiometabolic health among children and 3) whether
socio-cultural factors (i.e, ethnic identity, parental closeness, place of birth) modify the association between
social and economic stress and DNA methylation and mtDNA damage association. We will furthermore
implement mendelian randomization techniques to address the cross-sectional nature of the data.
Completion of this project would allow us to elucidate the impact social and economic stressors have on
epigenetic and cardiometabolic markers that may help explain how stress shapes persistent population
health disparities among Latino populations."

The combined mentorship, training and research in this K01 award will support the candidate’s long term
goal of formulating high impact, community-engaged HIV health disparities and social media-based
research focused on sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) of color in the South. HIV remains an
insidious public health concern among Black SGMY in the South. Diagnose is one of the 4 Pillars of the
Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative and routine testing is a clear priority for this population.
Infrequent or never testing for HIV has been associated with high rates of infection in Black SGMY. Routine
HIV testing could provide a central gateway for linkage to HIV prevention services for those at risk or early
access to care for those unaware of their status; however, stigma-related barriers to testing persist (e.g,
internalized homophobia, HIV-related stigma). Stigmatized Black SGMY may be more isolated and many
turn to social media. Leveraging social networks, such as through Popular Opinion Leaders (POLs), via
social media can increase social support and destigmatize and normalize routine HIV testing. Despite its
popularity, Instagram has not been utilized in HIV-focused interventions, including among Black SGMY.
Instagram influencers are authentic and credible social media users who are, in essence, POLs. This project
proposes to enhance the EHE-recommended POL intervention promoting routine HIV testing in Black
SGMY in New Orleans. The project will employ 8 Black SGMY Instagram influencers to implement a novel,
theoretically-grounded approach to crafting persuasive HIV testing messages to their followers. To this
end, the candidate will: 1) Explore HIV testing attitudes and experiences and the use of non-stigmatizing
Instagram messaging to increase routine HIV testing for Black SGMY in New Orleans; 2) Identify, recruit
and train Black SGMY Instagram influencers on HIV knowledge and social-media based messaging
strategies using a novel framework for persuasive messaging; 3) Co-develop and deliver persuasive routine
HIV testing Instagram messages with Black SGMY Instagram influencers. A team of experienced mentors
with expertise in Black SGMY health disparities, HIV intervention development, persuasion theory, social
media messaging and community-based participatory research (CBPR) will guide the candidate through
the research. The diverse training plan will consist of multidisciplinary didactic coursework, individualized
training workshops and mentoring sessions, which will allow the candidate to: 1) Understand how the
intersection of multiple stigmatized identities (i.e., racial, gender and sexual) and related experiences
contribute to HIV-related disparities among Black SGMY; 2) Develop proficiency in persuasive social
media-based health communication strategies; 3) Gain skills in the development/ adaptation,
implementation and evaluation of interventions utilizing CBPR. This K01 award will give the candidate the
additional skills and experience needed to achieve research independence."
10798122,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [ONFH] is a crippling hip disorder affecting children
and young adults that can lead to collapse of the femoral head, osteoarthritis, and the need for a hip
replacement at a young age. Clinical management of young patients with early-stage ONFH focuses on
preventing femoral head collapse, at which point little can be done to salvage the hip joint. However, one of the
primary hip preservation treatments for early-stage ONFH, core decompression surgery (which involves drilling
into the femoral head), fails to prevent disease progression in 30% or more of patients. This failure can be
attributed in part to delayed diagnosis and limited ability to predict and monitor treatment response using
current clinical imaging methods (radiography and conventional T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI]). Our long-term goal is to improve clinical outcomes for children and adults with or at risk for
ONFH through the synergistic advancement of imaging and therapies. The objective of this R01 proposal is to
address the need for better imaging to inform treatment of early-stage ONFH by characterizing the sensitivity
of advanced MRI techniques to assess bone ischemia, necrosis, and repair. Our central hypothesis is that
quantitative MRI methods are sensitive in detecting early-stage ONFH and provide quantitative measures of
the degree of ischemic injury and subsequent repair to the femoral head. We will build upon our promising
work using a piglet model of ischemic ONFH, which has demonstrated that quantitative, non-contrast-
enhanced MRI techniques, including relaxation time mapping, diffusion imaging, and perfusion imaging, are
sensitive and reliable in detecting ischemic injury to the femoral head. In Aim 1, we will expand upon our piglet
model studies to identify the cellular changes driving the sensitivity of the quantitative MRI methods to ischemic
injury and drilling-induced repair of the femoral head. Animals will be imaged in vivo at 3T MRI, and the femoral
heads will subsequently be assessed histologically. In Aims 2 and 3, we will take initial steps to clinically
translate the quantitative MRI methods by conducting pilot studies to detect early-stage injury and monitor
response to core decompression treatment in patients with ONFH. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether the
quantitative MRI methods can detect femoral head ischemia without use of a gadolinium contrast agent in a
pilot study of children with juvenile idiopathic ONFH (also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease). In Aim 3, we
will evaluate whether the quantitative MRI methods can detect a reparative response to core decompression in
a pilot study of adults being treated for early-stage ONFH, and whether the response differs in those patients
whose treatment fails to prevent femoral head collapse versus those whose treatment is successful in
preventing disease progression. Collectively, these aims are a critical step toward improving long-term
outcomes for young patients with early-stage ONFH through advancement of imaging to allow for new
opportunities for therapeutic intervention and the evaluation of the efficacy of new treatments."
10745350,"Recently, significant progress in understanding tauopathies and how tau aggregates lead to neurodegeneration has been made by the description of the atomic structures of tau filaments from human brain. We have determined structures (resolutions of up to 2.7Å) of tau filaments from three individuals with typical progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and four with variant PSP. Clinically, typical cases of PSP are characterized by postural instability, supranuclear gaze palsy, behavioral and cognitive impairment, as well as bulbar symptoms. Neuropathologically, they are defined by abundant subcortical neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads (composed of 4R tau), together with tufted astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies. Atypical forms of PSP may be distinguished by differences in tau load in specific brain regions. In all cases of PSP, tau filaments are made of a single protofilament with an ordered core (PSP fold). During our study, we identified one case that had a different tau structure. Histologically, this case was also different from PSP because displayed abundant spherical, 4R tau immunoreactive, basophilic neuronal inclusions in frontal cortex and limbic structures. We named this disease ‘limbic-predominant neuronal inclusion body 4R tauopathy’ (LNT). LNT is a novel form of 4R tauopathy. The studies proposed in this MPI application are a logical continuation of this groundbreaking work. Cryo-EM analysis of an additional “PSP” case showed a different fold and histological profile from PSP (LNT-II). The overall goal of this application is to determine the prevalence of LNT in two large cohorts of PSP cases (Indiana and Toronto cohorts), characterize LNT-I and –II, two novel 4R tauopathies, and determine whether additional novel 4R entities can be identified that were previously diagnosed as PSP. We will also provide biochemical and structural validation of in vitro and in vivo models for mechanistic and therapeutic studies. In order to achieve our goals, our proposal has three specific aims. The first is to perform neuropathologic, genetic, and cryo-EM studies on a large cohort of PSP cases to characterize the prevalence and neuropathologic features of LNT and assess whether additional entities are present (and their tau structure). Second, we will identify the molecular changes occurring in tau in LNT-I/–II and characterize the seeding ability and potency of tau in vitro. Lastly, we will characterize the propagation of tau filaments from PSP and LNT-I/-II patients using custom microfluidic devices and a murine model. We will determine the atomic structure of seeded filaments from mice and assess whether tau conformers and their structural polymorphs are propagated true to their original form in vivo."

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a ubiquitous mechanism in biology, serving as the basis for
mediating steps involving biosynthesis of metabolites, radical generation and transport, and the activation of
substrates at cofactors. The control of highly reactive radical intermediates is achieved by coupling proton and
electron transfer processes. Management of radicals in biology is of particular relevance to human health, as
enzymes operating by PCET are therapeutic targets with wide-ranging applications including chemotherapy,
anti-retroviral and anti-bacterial drugs and anti-inflammatory agents. Of the enzymes that operate by PCET,
ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are exceptional in their biological function and are paramount to health, as
the enzymes produce the DNA building blocks for life. The central role of RNRs in nucleic acid metabolism has
made the human RNR the target of five clinically used therapeutics that shut down the PCET pathway and,
consequently, nucleotide reduction. The class Ia RNR is the exemplar of biological PCET; its function
originates from a reversible long-range radical transport pathway that spans 35 Å and two subunits (α and β)
upon every turnover. An interdisciplinary approach integrates a suite of experimental methods encompassing
biochemistry, steady-state and transient biophysical spectroscopies, synthesis, and electrochemistry to target
three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 seeks to address the role of PCET in nucleotide reduction, both in the
substrate activation phase involving the conserved radical at the “top face” of the active site, as well as in the
radical substrate reduction phase at the “bottom face” of the active site. Work will be advanced by (i) leveraging
newly developed selenocysteine incorporation methodologies to alter proton inventories and electron affinities,
(ii) examining rate constants of individual steps using model compounds, and (iii) structurally capturing
forward radical transport leading into the active site. As the coupling between the proton and electron along
the radical transport pathway is the target of conformational gating by the enzyme, Specific Aim 2, is designed
to identify amino acid networks that govern allosteric PCET regulation between the α and β subunits, and to
rigorously define the structural dynamics at the interface that modulate RNR activity. This work is guided by
new structural insights afforded from cryo-EM studies, which allow both the nature of subunit interactions and
the networks of amino acids that connect the catalytic, specificity, and activity sites of the intact enzyme to be
identified. The structural and temporal visualization of subunit dynamics that come from these studies will
inform on the design of new small molecule therapeutics targeting the subunit interface. Specific Aim 3 will
utilize biochemical and molecular biology innovations to elucidate initial events of radical transfer within the β-
subunit with a focus on a critical tryptophan within the PCET pathway. These data will contribute to an
understanding of how the radical of RNR remains unreduced until required for activity, and the role of the
protein structure in coordinating PCET within β and relaying radicals to the α subunit."

Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly linked to severe pathological conditions causing cardiomyopathies and neurodegeneration. Today we can utilize fluorescent probes to detect dynamic changes in ROS levels in cell physiology and pathophysiology. However, the capabilities of many ROS sensors are currently still limited by small signal amplitudes, slow kinetics, low sensitivity, in vivo incompatibility, and restraints in cellular and subcellular targeting. Thus, monitoring ROS of oxidative stress in real-time is still very restricted. 
Our central goal in this proposal is to resolve current limitations in ROS protein sensors. We will combine structured-guided protein design and high-throughput screening of large variant libraries in an innovative approach to engineer novel ROS sensors. We expect that significantly increasing signal amplitudes, ROS sensitivity, and insensitivity to hypoxic conditions will enable us to monitor oxidative stress in a wide range of disease models. Furthermore, we will validate new sensors in stem-cell derived models for neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathies with subcellular precision. Our objective is to further maximize ROS sensor function for advanced monitoring of oxidative stress in disease models in response to acute and chronic stressors. In the first aim, we will broaden the color spectrum of this class of sensors by fusing green, yellow, and red fluorescent proteins to a ROS sensitive protein domain . Furthermore, we will create sensors that are more photostable and insensitive to varying oxygen levels compared to fluorescent proteins. In the second aim, we will use a novel engineering platform for fluorescent sensors that allows us to screen large libraries of randomized variants. The fast, iterative process has the potential to significantly accelerate the optimization of sensor frameworks established in Aim 1. In the third aim, we will validate our sensors in several realistic use scenarios to receive immediate feedback for further refinement of sensor function. This includes the monitoring of oxidative stress as an indicator for Alzheimer’s disease, ischemia and reperfusion in stem-cell-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes. This proposal is significant because oxidative stress is common and can affect every organ and cell type resulting in a large number of severe diseases. Recent progress in fluorescent microscopy allows us to utilize specific probes to monitoring physiological processes with increasing precision. The engineering of improved ROS sensors will significantly expand the utility of those methods for the analysis of cell signaling and disease progression. Our project is innovative because the proposed approach will provide the fastest throughput for the design of highly efficient ROS sensor proteins. Furthermore, the improved sensors will be able to causally link disease phenotypes to acute and chronic stressors of oxidative stress with significantly increased temporal and spatial resolution."

Macrophages play paradoxical roles in cancer: They can be tumoricidal, but in many cancers, macrophages
promote metastasis. There has been growing evidence that macrophages can modulate cell behavior via
unconventional cell contact-mediated communication in development and homeostasis. We have recently
extended these paradigms by discovering that macrophages can also engage in unconventional cell contact-
mediated communication with tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment, and that these interactions
contribute to metastasis. By visualizing and manipulating highly migratory melanoma cells and their
microenvironment in vivo, we unexpectedly found that tumor-associated macrophages transfer cytoplasmic
contents to melanoma cells in a cell contact-dependent manner. Remarkably, 70-80% of melanoma cells that
received macrophage cytoplasm disseminated from the primary tumor in both zebrafish and murine models.
We are now ideally positioned to identify key component(s) that are transferred from macrophages to tumor
cells for metastasis, and how this transfer occurs. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that perform a variety
of essential cellular functions. Mitochondria have been shown to transfer to tumor cells in vivo, restoring their
respiration and ability to form tumors. While these elegant “proof of principle” studies demonstrated that
mitochondrial lateral transfer can occur in the tumor microenvironment, the donor stromal cell(s) were not
identified, the transfer mechanism was not defined, and the fates and functions of mitochondria in tumor cells
were not characterized. Excitingly, we have found that primary human macrophages can transfer mitochondria
to human breast cancer cells and melanoma cells, two cancers in which macrophages have been shown to
play a pro-tumorigenic role. Tumor cells that receive macrophage mitochondria either by spontaneous
mitochondrial transfer in coculture, or by direct injection of purified macrophage mitochondria, exhibit increased
proliferation. Surprisingly, we find that after mitochondrial transfer occurs, the transferred mitochondria remain
as a spatially distinct population from the host mitochondrial network. Furthermore, we found that high levels of
local reactive oxygen species accumulate at transferred mitochondria, suggesting an intriguing hypothesis that
transferred mitochondria may provide a signal to tumor cells, rather than providing excess mitochondrial
function as has been previously described. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: (Aim 1) Understand how
mitochondria dynamically reorganize for mitochondrial transfer to tumor cells and (Aim 2) Determine how
mitochondrial transfer mechanistically induces cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, these experiments will
reveal whether macrophage mitochondrial transfer can instruct breast cancer and melanoma cells to become
more robust and metastatic. Our goals are to define how immune cells function in the tumor microenvironment,
and to provide a basis for developing future immunotherapies that limit metastasis."

Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at increased risk of comorbid psychiatric and medical
disorders. Comorbidity of disease poses a challenge to both the diagnosis and treatment of AUD, but the
etiologic factors underlying comorbidity are not well understood. Recent large-scale genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have identified common risk markers for AUD and several other traits. Genetic correlations
between AUD and psychiatric disorders have identified genetic overlap across multiple loci. These findings
suggest that there are common loci or biological pathways that increase risk for multiple disorders. Identifying
these loci will provide insight into the etiologic pathways for comorbid disorders, and could advance efforts to
accurately diagnose, categorize, prevent, and treat AUD and co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions.
Research to date has been limited by the lack of resources with well characterized phenotypic information
alongside genetic data for large numbers of individuals. The project proposed in this K-award application uses
information collected with a comprehensive psychiatric interview schedule in a sample of >15,000 individuals
enriched for substance use disorders to create a multi-phenotype dataset for phenome-wide association
analysis. Polygenic risk scores for the same set of individuals will be used to characterize the genetic liability
for disease. We will: 1) identify phenotypes associated with genetic liability for AUD; 2) identify whether genetic
liability for other traits is associated with AUD; 3) incorporate biological information to identify pathways that
underlie comorbid risk; and 4) include environmental factors to test for gene-environment interactions. Our
ethnically diverse sample (nearly equal numbers of African and European ancestry) will allow us to establish
the genetic liability for comorbidities in both ancestral populations. In the context of conducting this research,
this career development award will enable the applicant to obtain fundamental training in the phenomenology
and assessment of psychiatric phenotypes to allow the accurate translation of the phenotypic records into a
dataset for high-throughput genetic analysis. Additionally, the applicant will acquire the necessary skills in
genetic epidemiology to develop models for genetic liability and comorbid disease. The proposed project will
provide a foundation for future studies that would allow stratification of individuals into personalized treatment
programs based on their disease etiology, along with the promise of early identification of at-risk individuals to
target with intervention strategies."
10758265,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial tumor of young children, and the five-year overall
survival of children with high-risk disease is less than 50%. Overexpression of multidrug resistance protein 1
(MRP1), a plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, is associated with high-risk
neuroblastoma. MRP1 transports multiple neuroblastoma chemotherapeutic agents out of the cell in a
glutathione (GSH)-dependent manner. Other MRP1 substrates are transported in a GSH-independent manner,
and certain compounds stimulate MRP1-mediated GSH efflux without being transported themselves. The
mechanisms of GSH-dependent and GSH-independent MRP1 substrate transport – as well MRP1-mediated
GSH efflux – are still not well understood. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to determine the structural basis
of GSH-dependent vs. GSH-independent substrate transport by MRP1 using cryo-electron microscopy coupled
with biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based assays for MRP1 function. Specific Aim 2 of this proposal seeks
to determine the structural basis of the activation and inhibition of GSH efflux by ligands that regulate MRP1
activity. The successful completion of these aims will fill a gap in the research literature by determining the
structural basis for MRP1 substrate poly-specificity, particularly with respect to chemotherapeutic agents used
in the treatment of neuroblastoma, and will provide a basis for future therapeutic intervention.
 The proposed research strategy will be completed under the mentorship of Dr. Jue Chen in the Laboratory
of Membrane Biology and Biophysics at The Rockefeller University in New York City. The accompanying
fellowship training plan will be completed through the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program of Weill Cornell Medicine,
The Rockefeller University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The exceptional clinical and scientific
resources of these environments will facilitate the successful completion of both research and training
components. The biochemical, biophysical, and structural biology equipment and expertise available at The
Rockefeller University is unparalleled, and trainees are also encouraged to collaborate with other scientists and
institutions in New York City’s rich structural biology research network. The Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program
offers a diversity of clinical, research, and extracurricular opportunities for trainees to develop the analytical,
technical, communication, and mentoring skills necessary to become an independent physician-scientist.
Trainees are encouraged to continuously develop their clinical and scientific skills throughout both medical and
graduate phases of the MD-PhD curriculum. This curriculum is supervised by a supportive administration that
provides ample guidance for trainees to pursue productive careers promoting the health of the American public."

Radiotherapy using protons is an attractive option as it has the potential to better preserve healthy tissue
compared to radiation with photons or electrons, and because trial outcomes indicate it can replace surgery for
radical cancer treatments as well. Proton therapy makes use of the finite range of heavy charged particles with
an intensity maximum at the end of their path (Bragg peak) followed by a sharp fall-off of the dose. However,
predicting the proton range based on computed tomography (CT) scans carries an estimation uncertainty. For
treatments with proximal critical organs and limited accessibility (head and neck), high heterogeneities (lung),
or significant breath motion (liver) such uncertainty is too high and the therapy is in the best case challenging, if
not impossible. New instrumentation is needed to monitor the location of the Bragg peak to 1-2 mm accuracy
within several seconds in these challenging scenarios.
We propose to use the novel Cerenkov Charge Induction (CCI) thallium bromide (TlBr) detectors for proton
range verification (PRV) in proton therapy. CCI TlBr detectors combine the detection of Cerenkov light, which
provides sub-nanosecond timing resolution with the conventional readout of semiconductor detectors, which
provides excellent energy resolution and 3-D segmentation. Moreover, TlBr has a shorter attenuation length
than most commonly used scintillation materials for prompt-gammas up to 6.1 MeV. CCI TlBr detectors provide
a unique performance, as they offer simultaneous excellent performance in energy, time, and spatial
resolution, that fits the needs of PRV in proton therapy.
In this project, we will test the feasibility of using a non-collimated prompt gamma timing – Compton camera
(PGT-CC) camera based on pixel CCI TlBr detectors for PRV in proton therapy. We will 1) manufacture pixel
CCI TlBr detectors with optimized surface treatment to couple the photodetector and with highly-stable long-
lasting electrodes; 2) characterize the detector features of pixel CCI TlBr devices in a benchtop setting using
sealed sources, including energy, spatial, and timing resolution; 3) evaluate the performance of a PGT-CC
camera for PRV made with pixel CCI TlBr detectors in a beamline with protons accelerated to 67.5 MeV; and
4) compare the performance of our PGT-CC camera prototype with gold standard techniques following realistic
treatment protocols at a clinical beamline with protons accelerated to >200 MeV.
The accomplishment of the aims of this project will determine the potential of CCI TlBr detectors to become the
most competitive devices for PRV in proton therapy. A successful performance of the proposed detection
system would allow to exploit the benefits of proton therapy in treatment regions that are currently very
challenging, leading to increased treatment efficacy and lower toxicity in the healthy organs of the patients."

Increasing access to tobacco cessation medications is a key part of U.S. health policy’s strategy for reducing
smoking, especially for low-income smokers, who are less likely to use tobacco cessation medications than
high-income smokers are. Given that the Affordable Care Act requires Medicaid programs to cover tobacco
cessation medications, Medicaid coverage grants enrollees access to tobacco cessation medications in
principle, but over two-thirds of state Medicaid programs require doctors to obtain prior authorization from
program administrators before prescribing tobacco cessation medications. While prior authorization
requirements’ advocates argue that requiring prior authorization can ensure appropriate and cost-effective
prescribing without reducing access to helpful medications, even small prescribing hurdles have the potential
to have large impacts on prescribing behavior and medication access. Public health leaders call for removing
barriers in access to tobacco cessation medications, but it is not currently known if requiring prior authorization
meaningfully reduces overall use of these medications or if it instead ensures appropriate use without reducing
access more generally, as its advocates argue. This project proposes to estimate the impact of prior
authorization requirements in Medicaid on the use of tobacco cessation medications by using detailed data on
health care claims to study Colorado’s Medicaid program removing its prior authorization requirement for
tobacco cessation medications in 2018. A primary objective of the proposed project is to estimate the impact of
Colorado removing its prior authorization requirement on overall tobacco cessation prescriptions and related
treatments. A second objective is to estimate heterogeneous impacts of removing prior authorization
requirements for different demographic groups. The project then proposes to use the estimates to conduct
additional analyses to assess the national implications of Medicaid programs requiring prior authorization for
tobacco cessation medications. In addition, the project proposes to test for heterogeneous effects of prior
authorization requirements based on prior health conditions to assess the claim that the main effect of prior
authorization requirements is to avoid prescriptions that Medicaid programs could identify as potentially being
inappropriate. Achieving these aims will provide stakeholders with information that can be used when making
decisions about whether to require prior authorization for tobacco cessation medications and, conditional on
requiring prior authorization, to set up systems and rules that improve the prior authorization process for
tobacco cessation medications. Achieving the aims of this study will address multiple research priorities of the
National Cancer Institute by increasing knowledge about barriers in access to evidenced-based cessation
treatments, by identifying strategies to increase the use of cessation treatments for people with low
socioeconomic status, and by providing insights into how insurers can contribute to tobacco cessation."
10802400,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is responsible for numerous, highly prevalent comorbidities such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), dyslipidemia, liver diseases, and cancers - all of which are indispensably
related to adipose tissue pathologies. Adipose tissue is vital for metabolic health and undergoes pronounced
pathological changes in obesity, including chronic inflammation, decreased adipogenesis, fibrosis, and impaired
metabolic function. Here the PI proposes to test an unconventional mechanism to integrate adipose tissue
pathological changes in obesity. He demonstrates a stark accumulation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) particularly
in white adipose tissues (WAT) in both aging- and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, whereas caloric restriction (1),
the most effective intervention against metabolic dysfunctions, specifically reduces adipose IgG. IgG is the major
class of antibodies and is traditionally viewed as a circulating protein for immune defense. Administering
exogenous IgG in lean mice mimics obesity with an enriched distribution to WAT, impairs insulin sensitivity, and
induces adipose tissue inflammation. Depleting IgG in the whole body by knocking out (KO) the sole IgG
recycling protein FcRn in myeloid cells (FcRnflox/flox:LysM-Cre, FcRn-mKO) prevents high fat diet-induced weight
gain, adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunctions. Furthermore, from a therapeutic
perspective, targeting FcRn by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) inhibits IgG accumulation, improves
adipogenesis and brown remodeling, and restores metabolic functions in DIO mice. IgG treatment directly
induces inflammatory and fibrotic genes in adipocyte precursors and represses PPARg, the ultimate adipogenic
factor, resulting in impaired adipogenesis. Therefore, he hypothesizes that IgG is a critical factor that drives the
pathological remodeling of WAT and metabolic dysfunctions in obesity, and FcRn-dependent recycling is
required for its abnormal accumulation in WAT. By combining mouse genetic, biochemical, cellular, and
molecular approaches, he will critically test this hypothesis by the following specific aims. In Aim 1, he will first
understand how IgG is preferentially accumulated in WAT in obesity. Within WAT, FcRn is predominantly
expressed in adipose stromal cells (ASCs, Pdgfra+) and adipocytes. Therefore, he has conditionally knocked
out FcRn in ASCs (FcRnflox/flox:Pdgfra-Cre, FcRn-pKO) and adipocytes (FcRnflox/flox:Adipoq-Cre, FcRn-aKO). He
will dissect their respective contributions to adipose IgG accumulation and pathological remodeling. He will
further determine their effects on metabolic dysfunctions and whole-body IgG homeostasis in obesity. In Aim 2,
he will elucidate a molecular mechanism by which IgG impairs adipose functions through a Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)/PPARg axis. In summary, the proposed work will identify IgG as a pathogenic factor in the maladaptation
of WAT in obesity, thereby providing a mechanism that integrates the hallmarks of obese WAT. Uncovering the
requirement of FcRn in adipose IgG accumulation will incite a novel therapeutic strategy through targeting IgG
recycling to restore metabolic health in obesity."

There are currently no cardiovascular (CV) risk prediction tools for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
in clinical practice today. In fact, the optimal approach to CV risk stratification in patients with CKD is uncertain,
highly contested and confounded by a paucity of published data. Furthermore, traditional risk prediction models
fail in their predictive accuracy for CV events in patients with CKD, underestimating risk by up to 50%. This is
exceedingly problematic, given that CVD is the leading cause of death in CKD. This has forced clinicians to
consider alternative approaches such as the assessment of coronary artery calcification (CAC) score (by
cardiac CT) or myocardial fibrosis (by native T1 MRI) as risk stratification tools, however there remains
considerable clinical equipoise regarding their prognostic utility in CKD. Moreover, emerging evidence
suggests that evaluation of CV structure at rest rather than ascertainment of function under the stress of
exercise, may be insufficiently sensitive to accurately reflect the risk of premature CV death in CKD. Although
exercise has been shown to be among the most potent predictors of future CV evens, it is rarely assessed in
patients with CKD. Recent work by our group suggests that global indices of CV functional capacity (as
assessed by oxygen uptake (VO2) at peak exercise) using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) may offer
a potential solution for accurately prognosticating CV risk in CKD. If CPET could be used to accurately predict
future CV events and risk stratify CKD patients, this could have practice changing implications. Potential
applications include the identification of patients for earlier or more intensive medical or dialytic therapies, in
the selection and prioritization of patients for timely kidney transplantation, in pre-operative risk assessment for
major surgery and to help guide the selection of patients for coronary angiography. The overall aim of the
proposed study is therefore to define the optimal diagnostic test and CV functional index for CV risk
discrimination and prognostication. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that measurement of VO2Peak
by CPET will be superior to other diagnostic tests for predicting future CV events in patients with advanced
CKD. The present study is a proof-of-concept single-center prospective study that will recruit a total of n=140
racially and ethnically diverse advanced CKD stage 5D (hemodialysis) patients. All patients will undergo
functional (physical function testing and CPET) and structural (cardiac CT and T1 MRI) assessments at
baseline and repeat functional testing at 1-year. CV outcomes will be assessed prospectively at 3-years.
AIM 1 (A) will determine the predictive value of VO2Peak compared to other clinically used tests (cardiac CT,
T1 MRI, physical function testing) for predicting CV outcomes at 3-years; and (B) determine if changes in
VO2Peak is superior to single baseline VO2Peak for predicting cardiovascular outcomes at 3-years.
AIM 2 will develop a new risk stratification model and assess whether the inclusion of functional indices can
better prognosticate future cardiovascular outcomes in CKD compared to traditional risk scores."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease in Caucasians. Impaired
mucociliary clearance predisposes individuals with CF to chronic respiratory infections, resulting in progressive
lung damage and premature death. We and others have shown that oral bacteria infect the lungs in individuals
with CF at high concentrations. Caries and gingivitis are associated with an increased abundance of
pathogenic and often proinflammatory intraoral bacteria that can be aspirated. Dental plaque flora can cause
pneumonia, for example in mechanically-ventilated patients. Given the broader evidence of oral-respiratory
links, it is surprising that the association between oral diseases and respiratory health in CF has never been
evaluated, even though there is a plausible microbiological mechanism. The overall hypothesis of this proposal
is that oral diseases, defined as caries and gingivitis, are potentially modifiable contributors to lung disease in
CF. In this 5-year observational U01, we will enroll 210 adolescents and young adults with CF ages 12 to 30
years at 3 sites: Seattle Children’s Hospital, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and the University of
Alabama at Birmingham. The study will involve 3 study visits over 24 months. We will obtain quantitative and
qualitative data on risk factors for oral diseases; perform a standardized assessment of caries and gingivitis;
evaluate respiratory health outcomes; and collect sputum, saliva, and plaque for microbiome analyses. The
Aims are to: (1) Describe the prevalence and incidence of oral diseases in adolescents and young
adults with CF and identify corresponding risk factors with an emphasis on how to improve key oral
health behaviors; (2) Evaluate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between oral diseases and
respiratory outcomes; and (3) Explore microbiome pathways that link oral and respiratory health. The
proposed study will be the largest and first longitudinal CF oral health study to date, and the first to evaluate
respiratory outcomes associated with oral diseases in CF. Our long-term objective is to develop behavioral
randomized clinical trials for adolescents and young adults with CF to prevent oral diseases and protect
respiratory health. We also seek to elucidate mechanisms that explain the systemic health consequences of
oral diseases. More broadly, our approach provides a framework for improving the oral health of medically
compromised populations through critical epidemiologic inquiry and evidence-based interventions."
10897712,"DectiSomes are lipid nanoparticles carrying an anti-infective drug and coated with pathogen receptor that
targets them to pathogenic cells. DectiSomes reduce the effective dose for inhibition and killing of pathogens
by order(s) of magnitude relative to conventional drugs, potentially overcoming the barriers of multidrug
resistant and persister cells. Herein we propose the initial development of pan-antibacterial DectiSomes,
testing them against three pathogenic mycobacterial species. One quarter of the world’s population have latent
or active TB infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There are several million new cases of TB and
1.7 million deaths every year. M. avium and M. ulcerans cause life-threatening pulmonary and dangerous skin
infections, respectively and are excellent laboratory models of TB. Pathogenic mycobacteria and fungal
pathogens have cell walls and extensive exopolysaccharide matrices rich in oligoglycans and oligolipoglycans.
The C-type lectin pathogen receptors Dectin-1 (DEC1), Dectin-2 (DEC2) and DC-SIGN (DCS12) recognize
diverse crosslink variants of these oligoglycans and signal the immune system of a pathogen infection. In
previously publications we’ve shown that antifungal drug loaded DectiSomes coated with DEC1, DEC2 and
DCS12 effectively target and kill diverse fungal pathogens both in vitro and in vivo in mouse disease models.
 Our working hypothesis for this proposal is that antibacterial drug loaded liposomes targeted to pathogenic
bacterial by pathogen receptors will be far more efficacious than untargeted antibacterial drugs. Our strong
preliminary data supporting this hypothesis show that rhodamine red fluorescent liposomes coated with Dectin-
1, Dectin-2 and DCS12 bound to M. avium cells and their exopolysaccharide matrix orders of magnitude more
strongly than untargeted liposomes or protein coated control liposomes. To further explore this hypothesis, we
will pursue the following Specific Aims. 1. Determine the efficiency and kinetics of receptor targeted rifampin
RIF-Loaded Liposomes DEC1-RIF-LLs, DEC2-RIF-LLs and DCS12-RIF-LLs binding to M. tuberculosis, M.
avium and M. ulcerans grown under various conditions in vitro. 2. Determine the effective dose (ED) of RIF
delivered by DEC1-RIF-LLs and DEC2-RIF-LLs for 95% inhibition and/or killing (ED95) of in vitro grown M.
tuberculosis, M. avium and M. ulcerans and demonstrate improved drug efficacy. 3. Using a mouse model of
TB (i.e., infected with M. tuberculosis), demonstrate that DEC1-RIF-LLs and DEC2-RIF-LLs delivered by oral
aspiration and/or intravenous injection dramatically lower the effective dose for 95% reduction in fungal burden
(ED95) and improve lung pathophysiology, relative to untargeted RIF-LLs and free RIF.
 The expected outcome is a precision targeted antibacterial system of drug delivery that reduces the
effective dose and number of treatments to control pathogenic mycobacterial infections and hence may reduce
drug toxicity to patients. We believe that once developed DectiSome-related technologies will provide the
dramatic leap forward needed to overcome the serious current limitations to antibacterial drug development."

CRISPR-Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonucleases that is being actively used for sequence-specific DNA
recognition, genome engineering, targeted transcriptional activation/repression and genome imaging. Cas9 is
being developed as a gene therapy agent for multiple pathologies, including HIV, vision disorders, muscular
dystrophy, and hereditary disorders. The precision control of specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 is required as off-
target effects and chromosomal translocations are observed at elevated activity. Further, the ease of targeting
catalytically impaired Cas9 to any genomic locus has resulted in transformative technologies. For example, the
fusion of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to transcriptional activators or repressors has enabled gene
transcription and repression; fusion of catalytically impaired Cas9 to base-modifying enzymes has allowed base
conversion (e.g., C→T) at specific genomic sites; dCas9‒GFP fusion has made imaging genomic loci possible;
and dCas9‒acetyltransferases or deacetylases fusion has enabled epigenome editing. We propose to apply
chemical and genetic approaches develop reagents and methods that will allow precision control of specificity
of CRISPR-Cas9.

Nutrition literacy is how well a person can use information about healthy eating to make healthy food choices.
Most Americans eat high calorie and nutrient-poor diets that promote obesity and chronic disease. To improve
the health of Americans, we must increase nutrition literacy. Americans need easy to follow and easy to access
healthy eating advice so they can choose healthy eating patterns. Parents affect their child's diet in many
ways, and diet patterns formed before age five years track throughout life. In this study, we propose to engage
Latino parents and their young children (1-5 years of age) using our culturally tailored, bilingual
(English/Spanish) mobile intervention, Nutricity. Our goals are to improve eating habits for obesity and disease
prevention.
Our aims are three-fold:
 1. Give a small sample of parent-child pairs access to Nutricity for three months. We will measure whether
 children have better eating patterns at the end of the study.
 2. We will measure whether the parent-child pairs who joined the study have similar characteristics with
 parent-child pairs of the clinic who were not studied or who joined but did not finish; whether parent-
 child pairs who joined the study were engaged; and whether there were other health-related

 3. We will measure if the pediatric clinic is a good setting to study Nutricity.
As a result, we will produce a mobile program to improve child eating patterns, using few resources from
clinics. If Nutricity is effective and feasible to deliver within the pediatric clinic setting, future research will
evaluate the implementation of Nutricity on a larger scale."

10773151,"Irisin is a novel signaling peptide proteolyzed from the cell membrane-bound protein Fndc5 (fibronectin type III
domain-containing protein 5), first described by our collaborators to release from muscle during exercise and
induce a thermogenic program in beige adipose tissue. A growing body of work has highlighted another key
role for irisin in mediating the effect of exercise on bone. Early work described an anabolic action, with
intermittent low doses of irisin stimulating cortical bone formation and preventing unloading-induced bone loss
in vivo, and serum-derived irisin from exercised mice enhancing osteoblastogenesis in vitro. Our group has
employed a genetic approach to further elucidate the role of irisin in skeletal remodeling, demonstrating that
forced expression of Fndc5 in muscle markedly reduced bone formation and osteoblast numbers while
increasing sclerostin (SOST) expression and osteoclast numbers. Global genetic deletion of Fndc5 conferred
complete protection against ovariectomy-induced bone loss, marked by maintenance of osteocyte lacunae and
blocked bone resorption with no increases in Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-β Ligand (RANKL)
expression despite prolonged estrogen deprivation. Similarly, short term irisin infusions in wild type mice
resulted in higher serum levels of sclerostin and RANKL. These results highlight the breadth of irisin’s signaling
effects in bone, and the need to further understand its overall impact on resorption and remodelling. We now
have additional evidence that irisin signals directly to the osteoclast via integrin αVβ5, stimulating differentiation
and resorption. The present work endeavors to delineate the full signaling pathway in the osteoclast, while
employing novel in vivo models to test this regulation of resorption in the context of skeletal response to
exercise. We have developed a novel conditional mouse allele of Fndc5 and generated a skeletal muscle-
specific targeted null, which we will use to test the effect of muscle-derived irisin on bone response to exercise.
In parallel, we will utilize in vitro techniques to confirm the putative receptors for irisin and characterize
intracellular signal transduction in the osteoclast. To comprehensively assess irisin’s impact on bone
resorption, we will also investigate indirect effects of irisin on the osteoclast, through regulation by the
osteocyte. Finally, as osteocyte response to mechanical cues is a key aspect of this cell’s function during
exercise, we will investigate the potential interplay between irisin signaling and mechanosensitivity. We predict
pleiotropic effects of irisin – it may be a coupling factor by directly stimulating both the osteoblast and
osteoclast, and also serve a unique role as a counter regulatory hormone to maintain calcium homeostasis by
increasing resorption. By focusing on the osteoclast, this work seeks to elucidate irisin’s role in initiating bone
resorption and better understand its influence on remodeling as a whole. Such insights both provide a greater
understanding of skeletal response to exercise but inform efforts to address bone degenerative diseases by
taking advantage of native signaling pathways."

This K08 Award encompasses a research and training plan to facilitate Dr. Regina Myers' transition to an
independent clinical investigator. Dr. Myers is currently an Instructor of Pediatrics and a pediatric oncology and
cell therapy physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term
goal is to develop an independent research program that will integrate early phase clinical trials with advanced
epidemiology methodologies in order to improve outcomes for children and young adults with high-risk
hematologic malignancies. The training objectives for this award will bridge her prior experience in
immunotherapy and outcomes research to her long-term goals, and include: acquiring independence in the
design and implementation of early phase immunotherapy clinical trials, expanding her expertise in clinical
epidemiology to include advanced methods for causal inference, establishing proficiency in the assessment of
clinical trial correlative endpoints, and gaining experience with the application of synthetic control arms in
pediatric cancer clinical trials. The proposed activities will be conducted in the resource-rich environment at
CHOP/Penn and under the mentorship of an expert, multidisciplinary team led by Dr. Stephan Grupp, an
international leader in cancer immunotherapy.
CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR19) have demonstrated unprecedented
responses in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Unfortunately, however, 50% of children
and young adults relapse suffer a subsequent relapse and their prognosis after post-CAR19 relapse is dismal.
As the use of CAR19 broadens, there is a corresponding increase in the number of patients with post-CAR19
relapse, creating a critical need to identify optimal salvage treatment approaches. The proposed research aims
to improve outcomes after post-CAR19 relapse using novel and complementary clinical research approaches.
In Aim 1, Dr. Myers will perform a phase 1/2 clinical trial to test a dual-antigen targeted CAR designed to
overcome the primary mechanisms of CAR failure in children with post-CAR19 relapse. Secondary analyses will
evaluate the predictive value of specific biomarkers for CAR failure and will compare the dual-targeted CAR
against synthetic external control data. In Aim 2, Dr. Myers will assess the comparative effectiveness of existing
treatment approaches for post-CAR19 relapse using randomized clinical trial emulation methods, leveraging
clinical trial and real-world data from the largest, single-center pediatric CAR cohort.
Successful completion of this career development award will advance the field through the introduction of a
novel, dual-antigen targeted CAR and the establishment of a robust clinical research infrastructure capable of
integrating real-world data with clinical trial data to determine optimal existing treatment strategies and efficiently
assess new therapies as they become available. The proposed studies and training plan will provide an
outstanding foundation for Dr. Myers' career as a physician-scientist."
10769799,"ABSTRACT
We are at the forefront of investigating novel neurodevelopmental disorders associated with polyamines. Our
overarching hypothesis is that mutations in genes of the polyamine pathway result in pathologically unbalanced
polyamine profiles in affected individuals that lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, Bachmann-
Bupp Syndrome (BABS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by heterozygous de novo variants
in the ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene, and Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS) is an X-linked genetic
disorder that results from mutations in the spermine synthase (SMS) gene. Both ODC1 and SMS are sentinel
genes in the regulation of polyamine metabolism. However, the precise pathways linking polyamines to these
neurodevelopmental disorders are not well defined. Based on our preliminary in vitro, animal, and clinical
patient data, we hypothesize that dysregulated polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) can be
normalized, and BABS and SRS phenotypes can be reversed through pharmacological intervention.
Importantly, we have compelling data showing that BABS patients accumulate active ODC enzyme and
produce large amounts of putrescine, and we showed that the FDA-approved ODC inhibitor DFMO
(Eflornithine) significantly improves BABS patient symptoms. We further hypothesize that similar gain-of-
function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) variants in other polyamine genes (e.g., eIF5A, DHPS, DOHH, SMOX,
AZ, AZI) exist, potentially giving rise to yet unknown polyamine disorders. Unfortunately, very little is known
about the underlying mechanisms that govern the phenotypes of polyamine-linked neurodevelopmental
disorders. In light of these facts, the overall goals of this application are to unravel the molecular mechanisms
and metabolic pathways that link polyamines to BABS and SRS and test polyamine-targeting agents (DFMO,
Me2Spm, others) in transgenic BABS and SRS murine models and human patient-derived primary cells and
lymphoblastoid cell lines. The following Specific Aims are designed to pursue these goals. Aim 1: Characterize
and pharmacologically treat genetic mouse models that mimic ODC1 gain-of-function mutations of individuals
with BABS to interrogate the molecular mechanisms that govern the human BABS patient phenotype. Aim 2:
Optimize pharmacologic treatment in cells from SRS-affected individuals and in a novel genetic mouse model
that mimics a common mutation in SRS patients. Aim 3: Expand the clinical understanding of BABS and SRS
to improve clinical care of a growing family of rare diseases. As the primary purpose of this proposal is to
define molecular mechanisms and metabolic pathways that govern BABS and SRS as well as to test the
effectiveness of treatments in relevant models, it is critical that we use disorder-specific mouse models. We will
use our BABS and SRS murine models and patient-derived cell lines, as we have previously published, to
determine the in vivo effectiveness of polyamine inhibitor treatments. Our study provides the rare opportunity to
potentially cure or at least ameliorate the symptoms of BABS and SRS, two human genetic disorders."
10775777,"Project Summary/Abstract
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive brain tumors in both children and adults with no effective
therapies. Over 80% of pediatric DMG and a majority of adult DMG harbor non-synonymous mutations in histone
H3 (H3.3K27M and H3.1K27M), which dysregulate chromatin and result in aberrant Pol II transcription in brain
tumors compared to normal tissue. Aberrant transcription is not only a cause of tumorigenesis, but also a
druggable vulnerability as there are multiple studies investigating the utility of Pol II and epigenome-targeting
drugs for the treatment of cancer. Despite the initial promise of compounds targeting transcriptional dysregulation
as potential cancer therapies, none of the drugs under investigation in clinical trials have improved DMG patient
survival thus far. A critical barrier to the discovery of more effective and less toxic therapies for DMG is our lack
of functional knowledge regarding the molecular pathways connecting H3K27M mutant histones to tumor
initiation and progression. We have recently conducted CRISPR screens identifying multiple regulators of Pol II
transcriptional elongation as genetic dependencies in H3K27M mutant cells, including Elongin B (ELOB), and its
binding partner, the Von Hippel-Lindau disease protein and tumor suppressor, VHL. Further preliminary studies
reveal that genetic ablation of ELOB alters the chromatin binding patterns of H3K27M mutant histones, and
disrupts DMG gene expression. These data support our overall hypothesis that H3K27M mutant histones enlist
the activity of specific gene regulatory complexes to induce Pol II transcriptional deregulation and trigger DMG
tumorigenesis.
 Our broad, long-term goal is to identity genes and molecular pathways driving glioma-specific
transcriptional programs and to determine their roles in brain cancer development and progression. We propose
the following specific aims: 1) Establish roles for Pol II elongation regulators in pre-clinical mouse models of
DMG and investigate genetic interactions between the elongation machinery and H3K27M; 2) Apply cutting edge
next generation sequencing analyses to dissect mechanisms of crosstalk between Pol II regulatory proteins and
H3K27M and determine their roles in promoting abnormal gene regulation in DMG; 3) Investigate an unexpected
oncogenic role for Elongin/VHL complexes in promoting malignant gene expression patterns and DMG tumor
growth. The significance of this work is that these studies will reveal new insights into how H3K27M oncogenic
histones co-opt specific Pol II regulators to promote tumorigenesis, and will uncover molecular mechanisms
driving aberrant chromatin and gene regulation in DMG and other cancers."

NovaSterilis, Inc. intends to develop and commercialize its novel sterilization platform based on supercritical carbon
dioxide (scCO2) and powerful sterilant, NovaKill™ for the pharmaceutical market – NovaAPI™. Sterilization of drug
substances (or active pharmaceutical ingredients; APIs) and drug products is a challenging application due to the
complexities of many drugs and biologics and the minimal compatibility of current sterilization modalities (e.g., steam,
radiation, ethylene oxide). Sterilization in the pharmaceutical industry is typically reserved only for drug substances that
move onto final assembly (i.e., aseptic processing and packaging), which does not provide the level of protection of
sterilization. Products intended to be sterile should be terminally sterilized in their final container whenever possible
(referred to as terminal sterilization) according to the FDA. However, there are very few drug products that utilize terminal
sterilization, and with respect to drug products in sealed containers (e.g., lyophilized drugs or formulated drugs) or
prefilled syringes, the only option for drug companies is to use aseptic processing for final assembly of these products,
which is a time consuming and resource heavy process. While the global sterilization services market for drugs is significant
at roughly $6 billion USD, offering solutions to drug manufacturers for terminally sterilizing drug containing end products
would be a game changer. The global prefilled syringe market alone is estimated to be $5.4 billion USD by the end of 2021,
and currently, the only solution for final assembly of these products is through aseptic processing. This represents a
significant opportunity for the NovaSterilis NovaAPI™ solution, with the potential for enormous upside in providing safer
products, eliminating the need for aseptic processing for process-compatible products and expanding on the number and
type of drug substances/products that can be terminally sterilized.
Previous research results support continued development of the NovaSterilis platform for sterilization of drug substances
and products with the potential for developing a terminal sterilization process for final drug products in vial/syringe
format. We have partnered with a global leader in sterilization services for the broader program, which should provide
significant application, customer, and market insight to the project. iFyber has proposed the following Specific Aims in this
Fast Track proposal to prepare NovaAPI™ for commercialization:
Phase I Specific Aims:
 · Aim 1: Establish a drug substance compatibility matrix for a select number of drugs using NovaAPI™
 · Aim 2: Establish baseline conditions for terminal sterilization of end products
Phase II Specific Aims:
· Aim 3: Complete assessment of sterilization validation process for SAL 10-6 for drug substances/products.
· Aim 4: Complete sterilization residuals testing following regulatory guidelines.
· Aim 5: Establish scale up process parameters and load configuration in a 100L vessel."

The Johns Hopkins Predoctoral Training Program in Human Genetics (HG) has long been a nationally
preeminent training environment for human genetic research. It has grown steadily since its inception (1980) in
parallel to the explosive growth of genetics and genomics, and their application to medicine. Although supported
by preceptor faculty across 20 diverse departments, the HG has its administrative and philosophical home in the
McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine (DGM). Eighty faculty mentors engage in training our current
cohort of sixty-one students. The preceptors’ research includes human and model organism genetics and
genomics, study of genes and variants underlying human monogenic disorders and complex traits, quantitative
genetics, gene therapy, oncogenetics, stem cells, technology development, big data and machine learning.
 An average of 12 students graduate each year and obtain their PhD in 5.3 years (average). The objectives
of the HG program are: (1) to provide a biomedical curriculum with breadth and depth; (2) to ensure an
understanding of the fundamental roles of genetic variation in human biology, diversity, and disease; (3) to
provide robust training in rigorous, reproducible, responsible, and ethical research; (4) to equip our trainees with
relevant professional skills and the opportunity to explore career options; and (5) to recruit and foster a diverse
and inclusive training environment for all. In the first year, we introduce students to the evolving concepts of the
gene, molecular biology, genomics, cell structure and dynamics, pathways and regulation, extending deeper with
advanced topics in human genetics. We introduce a new computational bootcamp to provide fundamental
computational and statistical skills, a theme that is iterated throughout their courses. In their second year we
have developed two highly innovative courses: Systems, Genes and Mechanisms in Disease and Genomic
Technologies Applications and Considerations. The courses integrate didactic presentation with student-led
seminars, team-based problem solving and discussion, placing their genetic training in a human biological and
pathological context and equipping them for the design and implementation of contemporary genomic
experimental strategies. We provide training in rigorous and ethical experimental design and implementation,
and career planning and professional development through workshops, internship opportunities and required
courses. Our preceptors receive mentoring training; are appropriately mentored; and they are accountable.
 The overall goal of our HG program is to educate the next generation of leaders in human genetics. We
seek to train independent scientists who are passionately curious about the role that genetic variation plays in
the human condition. This education prepares our students to answer important basic science questions and to
translate this information into bio-medical advances. The success of our graduates, in pursuing academic
careers, roles in government, private sector research, or using genetics in law and public policy supports this.
We request 14 training grant slots to support training grant eligible students during their first year in the program."
10764205,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Climate change is one of the most important global problems of our time. The consequences for human health
are already being felt, and pulmonary morbidity and mortality are increasingly impacted by wildfires, urban and
rural air pollution, altered aero-allergen exposures, the repercussions of severe storms and flooding, the
changing patterns and severity of pulmonary infections, and other factors. The harms disproportionately affect
children, older people, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, and people with underlying lung disease. Although
we have known this for some time, efforts to understand the diverse pulmonary responses and injuries from
climate change and to alter their course have been woefully inadequate. There are multiple explanations for
why we have not made more progress, but one contributor is that we have not been training the next generation
to tackle the lung health consequences of climate change. Thus, our goal is to train students and
postdoctoral fellows for cutting edge research in the pulmonary impact of climate change and strategies
to mitigate the effects. We have outstanding leadership with complementary and synergistic skills; Dr. David
Stoltz in the College of Medicine in basic and translational lung biology, and Dr. Peter Thorne in the College of
Public Health in pulmonary toxicology and environmental epidemiology. We have creative and innovative
mentors in four areas of emphasis: air pollution; allergens, airway biology, and environmental challenges;
extreme weather, disasters, and global warming; and lung infections. In addition to accepting post-doctoral
fellows, we take a forward-looking approach by accepting predoctoral graduate students and offering a summer
program for medical students. We strive to recruit, train, and retain a racially, gender, geographically (including
rural), and socioeconomically diverse group of trainees who are prepared to tackle the health consequences of
climate change, especially because those are the groups most vulnerable. Our existing expertise, programs and
interests position us exceedingly well for this direction, and our trainees will benefit from multidisciplinary
research teams and programs including the Environmental Health Sciences Research Center, Iowa Superfund
Research Program, Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Center for Global & Regional Environmental
Research, and a Collaboratory on Illuminating the Nexus Between Climate Change and Public Health. Our
program is focused on comprehensive training in research to understand and mitigate the impact of climate
change on lung health via multiple modalities that include active mentored research, didactic courses, activities
that enhance writing and presentation skills, community engagement, and endeavors that facilitate career
development. We encourage collaboration, networking, and creative partnerships with multiple scientists,
healthcare providers, and community members to advance solutions to the pulmonary harms of the accelerating
climate crisis. The program also benefits from the perspective and advice of an External Advisory Committee
composed of world leaders in the health risks of climate change and lung biology."
10772012,"Delirium, an acute disorder of attention and cognition, is a common, life-threatening, and costly condition for
older adults with strong links to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In 2015, responding to
RFA-AG-16-009, we created the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS I,
R24AG054259), a collaborative interdisciplinary network of 28 investigators spanning 27 institutions which has
provided research resources, meetings, pilot grants, and intensive mentorship for >90 trainees, leading to >340
first author papers and >46 grants as principal investigator. Despite this progress, a major knowledge gap in
the field remains: safe and effective treatments for delirium. Thus, in response to PAR-20-071, we propose to
expand the existing infrastructure as NIDUS II to advance the fundamental science needed to develop more
effective treatments for delirium, and ultimately, improve outcomes for delirium in all older adults and in those
with ADRD. Our specific aims are: (1) Harmonization Core. To develop and expand innovative measurement
methods related to harmonization of delirium measures, outcomes, and predictors for clinical studies and
treatment trials, and to refine measures of delirium diagnosis and severity in patients with all stages of ADRD.
These approaches will allow us to combine data from multiple existing delirium studies; (2) Research
Resources Core. To develop and expand the NIDUS Research Hub to create a collaborative infrastructure
that will seed future interdisciplinary studies to advance delirium research (e.g., biomarker studies, intervention
development studies); (3) Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core. To award pilot and exploratory grants that will
promote collaborative interdisciplinary studies designed to utilize our infrastructure and advance research
needed to develop better treatments for delirium. For this aim, we will assemble collaborative working groups
(WG) which will address 4 scientific priority areas: (a) Measurement: Harmonize and refine measurement of
delirium and related outcomes, including patients with ADRD, and to ensure accurate and sensitive measures
for treatment trials; (b) Pathophysiology: Biomarker and mechanistic studies to advance our understanding and
identify potential therapeutic targets for treatment trials; (c) Clinical Trials: Intervention development for new
multicomponent treatment approaches; (d) Inter-Relationship of Delirium and ADRD: Epidemiologic, risk factor,
pathophysiologic, prognostic, and especially treatment studies; (4) Career Development and Outreach Core:
for early-stage investigators who will utilize the NIDUS II infrastructure and will be involved in working groups,
pilot studies, and training events. Every aspect of NIDUS II is designed to seed innovative scientific discovery,
and drive delirium research in a critically important direction: development of effective treatments for delirium,
including delirium in ADRD. While we are building on the previous network, the innovation of the new NIDUS II
network is the purposeful application and expansion of the infrastructure to advance scientific exploration and
impact in specific priority areas of greatest benefit to older Americans.

10792488,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans, in which
salivary glands are the primary target of autoreactive T cells, leading to hyposalivation, the major
disease hallmark. Hyposalivation (dry mouth) causes a variety of oral health issues and severely
compromises quality of life. SS has no cure and current treatments are predominantly palliative. Failure
of therapies for SS are inextricably linked to the inability to control autoinflammation; thus, we propose
to investigate both simultaneously. To achieve sustainable salivary secretion, development of
approaches to simultaneously enhance endogenous salivary gland regeneration and protect the glands
from further injury from autoimmune inflammation are critically needed. Our preliminary studies
strongly suggest that there are protective actions provided by intermittent fasting (IF) in SS. In non-
obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-defined spontaneous model of SS, IF enhances the proliferation of
salivary gland stem cells, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling and Peroxisome Proliferator-
Activated Receptor-driven fatty acid oxidation, which are critically involved in the expansion and
differentiation of multiple stem cell types. It also mitigates autoreactive T helper 1, T helper 17 and
cytotoxic T cell responses in the salivary gland-draining lymph nodes. The objective of this proposed
project is to determine the previously unexplored impact of IF on the activity of endogenous salivary
gland stem/progenitor cells and autoimmune inflammation in SS to unravel the underlying molecular
and cellular mechanisms of IF benefits, with the long-term goal of developing effective and targeted
therapies to fundamentally improve salivary gland function. Based on the literature and our preliminary
results, we formulated the central hypothesis that IF exerts beneficial actions on salivary gland
restoration through promoting endogenous salivary gland regeneration and diminishing T cell mediated
autoimmune inflammation in SS. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: In
Aim 1, we will dissect the potential molecular mechanisms for the impact of IF on the proliferation and
differentiation of salivary gland stem cells in the NOD mouse, a spontaneous model of SS; In Aim 2,
we will assess the impact of IF on the self-expansion and cellular plasticity of ductal salivary gland
progenitor cells and acinar cells, the function and plasticity of T cell subsets, and the attenuation of
autoimmune inflammation in the salivary tissues, using lineage tracing mouse models and an inducible
model of SS. Successful completion of this study will provide new targets for the development of
effective new therapeutics for SS-like exocrinopathy, as well as provide insight into the treatment of
xerostomia caused by radiation, medications or aging, and other autoimmune diseases that share
similarities in their pathogenesis with SS."
10808868,"Background. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting up to 1 million Veterans. AF
increases the risk of stroke by 5-fold and is associated with higher rates of death. Oral anticoagulation reduces
the risk of stroke in AF by 60%, yet such therapy is underutilized. Further, racial and ethnic disparities in
anticoagulation for AF exist, despite a 2-fold higher risk of stroke among racial and ethnic minorities with this
condition. In pilot work conducted in >40,000 Veterans with newly diagnosed AF in FY 2017, black Veterans
were significantly less likely than white Veterans to receive any form of anticoagulant, particularly safer, more
effective therapy with direct-acting oral anticoagulants. In these analyses there was up to 2.5-fold facility-level
variation in the frequency of anticoagulation and in racial and ethnic disparities in such therapy. With the
detection of these treatment disparities documented in VA, this CDA-2 will quantitatively assess the multilevel
determinants of these disparities, qualitatively identify barriers to and facilitators of equitable anticoagulation for
AF, and use these findings to develop and pilot test implementation strategies to eliminate these disparities.
Significance / Impact. Ensuring access to high-quality, equitable care for all Veterans are VA and VA HSR&D
priority areas. This CDA-2 addresses underuse of an evidence-based therapy for racial and ethnic minority
Veterans with AF—a common and costly condition. The significance of this problem is likely to increase with
the aging of the Veteran population and the steadily increasing proportion of minority Veterans receiving health
care within VA. Innovation. This CDA-2 is framed using blended health equity and implementation science
conceptual models to understand and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care. This CDA-2 uses
novel data sources to assess the association of underexamined determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in
Veterans with AF and is among the first to qualitatively examine Veteran experiences with AF and
anticoagulation. Finally, this research will be the first to develop and test implementation strategies to reduce
disparities in anticoagulation for AF. Specific Aims. Aim 1 is a quantitative study to characterize the
association between race, ethnicity, and oral anticoagulant initiation in Veterans with AF. Aim 2 is a qualitative
study to examine stakeholder perceptions of the barriers to and facilitators of equitable oral anticoagulant
initiation in Veterans with AF. Aim 3 proposes to design and pilot test an empirically-developed implementation
strategy bundle to improve equitable oral anticoagulant initiation in Veterans with AF. Methodology. Aim 1
uses a national cohort of ~130,000 Veterans with incident AF in FYs 2010-2019 to assess the patient, provider,
and facility-level determinants of the association of race, ethnicity and anticoagulation. Aim 2 will recruit and
interview providers, administrators, and Veterans with AF about barriers to and facilitators of equitable
anticoagulant initiation for AF in VA. Aim 3 uses the findings from Aims 1 and 2 to develop and pilot-test the
feasibility of a set of implementation strategies to promote equitable anticoagulant initiation within a local VA
primary care practice. Implementation / Next steps. Findings from research Aims 1-3 will set the stage for a
hybrid type 3 trial to broadly test the effectiveness of the pilot-tested implementation strategies on equitable
anticoagulant initiation in Veterans with AF. Candidate. Dr. Utibe Essien is a general internist and Core
Investigator in the VA Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion. The short-term goal of this CDA-2 is
to gain training and research experience in understanding and implementing strategies to reduce treatment
disparities in Veterans with AF. This will be achieved through in-depth training in: (1) advanced quantitative
research; (2) qualitative research; (3) implementation science; and (4) professional leadership. This CDA-2 will

10767277,"Our research is focused on the role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)—a novel mechanism of functional
connectivity between cells—in the spreading of viruses, misfolded protein aggregates (leading to
neurodegenerative diseases), as well as the part they may play in the proliferation and persistence of cancer.
TNTs have been found in numerous cell types, allowing the transport of cytosolic and membrane-bound
molecules, organelles, calcium ﬂux, and the spreading of pathogens. In vitro, these structures are very
heterogeneous and numerous disparities have emerged both in their structure and functions. Similar ﬁlopodia-
like structures also exist in vivo and in tissue explants. Unfortunately, little is currently known about the basic
mechanism of TNT formation, their structural components, or the signaling pathways involved.
 Recent studies have revealed that TNTs do play an important physiological role in both health and
disease. Indeed, TNTs are significant mediators of electrical, antigen, and genomic signaling, while also
promoting cellular recovery after ischemic, inflamatory, and hypoxic injury. What's more, retroviruses, such as
the HIV-1, HSV-1, HTLV-1, and influenza exploit these subcellular structures to facilitate infection by evading
immune surveillance. Moreover, pathogenic particles and proteins, such as Aβ, prions, and HIV-1 Nef, are
found to induce, and then usurp TNT-like structures to spread between cells. Spreading through TNTs is highly
efficient, since it avoids diffusive transfer and evades immune detection. Finally, TNTs can mediate the direct
transfer of metabolic and genetic material between tumor cells and their stroma enhancing tumor cell
chemoresistance, tumor progression, and metastasis.
 With a previous NIH SCORE SC2 Pilot Project Award, we successfully developed a novel method to
specifically isolate distinct protrusion subtypes—based on their morphology or fluorescent markers—using
laser capture microdissection (LCM). Combined with a unique fixation and protein extraction protocol, we
pushed the limits of microproteomics and demonstrated that proteins from LCM-isolated protrusions can
successfully and reproducibly be identified by mass spectrometry using ultra-high field Orbitrap technologies.
Finally, our method confirmed that different subtypes of protrusions have distinct proteomes. Therefore, our
method created a unique opportunity to characterize TNTs shedding light on their role in health and disease.
 In this SCORE SC1 grant, we propose a three-step strategy to utilize our LCM/MS method to study
TNT formation and function. This entails: 1) Expanding the TNT proteome by incorporating different cell types,
induction methods, and TNT substructures using our LCM/MS method; 2) Collecting the TNT transcriptome to
limit the detection bias of the individual platforms while at the same time cross-validating TNT protein/pathway
identiﬁcations; and, 3) Identifying conserved TNT proteins and pathways, as well as potentially druggable
proteins and biomarkers."
10774231,"Project Summary / Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC)
disorders with frequent transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Molecular events leading to AML
transformation are poorly defined and the only curative therapy is allogeneic stem cell transplantations, for
which few patients are eligible. One of the reasons for ineffective treatments is the lack of understanding
of the mechanisms of disease. Therefore, investigations into the cellular and molecular basis of genetically-
defined MDS and AML subtypes are crucial to the development of novel therapies. Deletions on chromosome
(chr) 5q (del5q) are the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in MDS and are indicative of poor prognosis in
AML. However, the functions of individual genes within del(5q) are largely unexplored. We recently reported
that TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated (FHA) domain B (TIFAB) is deleted in all reported
cases of del(5q) MDS/AML and its deletion in mice results in phenotypes reminiscent of human MDS, due
partly to aberrant innate immune signaling via TRAF6 activation; but, we also observed increases in p53
activity. To fully elucidate the mechanism of TIFAB-dependent regulation of p53, we performed a proteomics
screen for TIFAB-binding proteins. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15), a deubiquitinase that stabilizes
MDM2 and enforces p53 degradation, emerged as the lead candidate. Therefore, we devised a multi-pronged
approach in which we first, characterized the TIFAB-dependent p53 activity in our Tifab-deficient MDS model
(Aim 1A), and second, uncovered the molecular mechanism of the TIFAB-USP15 complex in regulating p53
(Aim 1B). Our findings garnered rationale for defining the function of USP15 in established malignant
hematopoiesis, which is well underway and which we propose to complete during the F99 phase of this
research program (Aim 1C). Our preliminary data indicate that USP15 is highly expressed in AML and is
important for leukemic progenitor function, but not normal HSPCs. We will employ a combination of in vivo and
in vitro approaches using our Usp15-/- model, MLL-AF9 leukemia models, and AML cell lines to elucidate the
function of USP15 in AML. In completing my dissertation research, I have acquired a strong foundation in
mouse genetics, murine models, hematopoietic malignancies including MDS and AML, cancer biology, and
cellular mechanisms. I have learned biochemical assays, structure-function studies, and genetic studies, while
gaining familiarity with screening approaches including RNA-sequencing and proteomics. With my
comprehensive training, I am positioned and highly motivated to pursue a post-doctoral research direction
elucidating the determinants of USP15 activity, while utilizing drug discovery platforms to develop small-
molecule inhibitors against this druggable target (Aim 2)."
10769758,"The inability to clinically treat tumor metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer patient
deaths. Cell migration is a pivotal step in the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells from a primary tumor to
distant organs in the body. Cell motility is governed by cell-matrix interactions, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and
cell volume regulation via the involvement of ion transporters, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), as
explained by the Osmotic Engine Model (OEM). The roles of cytoskeleton and ion transporters in cell locomotion
have been typically studied in isolation. The overarching goal of this project is to employ a multidisciplinary
approach involving state-of-the-art bioengineering and imaging tools, quantitative analysis and in vivo models to
define the relative roles and potential crosstalk between ion transporters and the cytoskeleton in breast cancer
cell migration and metastasis in vivo. This application will test the hypothesis, supported by intriguing preliminary
data, that the coordinated action of local isosmotic swelling at the leading edge and shrinkage at the trailing edge
mediated by NHE1 and SWELL1, respectively, supports migration in confinement. We further hypothesize that
NHE1 and SWELL1 act in concert with cell cytoskeleton to mediate efficient migration and metastasis. Given the
lack of targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we will prioritize TNBC cell lines and patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) tumor cells as models. In Aim 1, we will establish the functional roles of NHE1 and
SWELL1 in cell migration inside confining µ-channels of different stiffnesses, in 3D gels and in cell dissemination
from 3D breast cancer cell organoids. We will also elucidate the mechanism responsible for the polarized
distribution of NHE1 and SWELL1 at the cell front and rear, respectively, and use novel optogenetic tools to alter
their spatial polarization and test how these alterations affect the direction and efficiency of cell migration. In
parallel, we will develop an innovative mathematical model to identify the key variables that enable OEM-
mediated cell motility. In Aim 2, we will delineate the interplay between OEM and the various cytoskeletal
constituents, including b1 integrins, myosin II, actin and microtubules. Importantly, we will define the intracellular
transport mechanisms responsible for NHE1 and SWELL1 shuttling along the longitudinal cell surface. We will
also introduce a comprehensive mathematical model to decipher the crosstalk of OEM and cytoskeletal
components in regulating migration efficiency. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the effects of NHE1 and SWELL1
silencing on cell migration in natural mammary tissue tracks in vivo and examine their roles in breast cancer
growth and metastasis, using TNBC cell lines and PDXs orthotopically transplanted to the 4th mammary fat pad
of mice. We will complement mouse studies with experiments in zebrafish, which enables us to image its entire
vasculature at exceptional optical clarity, in order to delineate the roles of ion transporters in different steps of
the metastatic cascade. This application brings together a team of investigators with expertise in bioengineering,
imaging, cell & molecular biology, quantitative analysis, PDXs, in vivo studies and breast cancer biology."
10762981,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common pediatric chronic conditions, affecting 187,000 children and
adolescents in the United States. It is a complex and demanding condition that requires intensive self-
management regimens to prevent complications. Despite improvements in diabetes technology to support self-
management, nearly 85% of adolescents with T1D fail to meet recommended glycemic targets, putting them at
risk for complications, reduced life expectancy, and diminished quality of life. Understanding and improving
how adolescents are using advanced diabetes technology to perform self-management tasks in real-time can
greatly improve the health of this high-risk population. The specific aims of the proposed research are: 1)
Collect and integrate data streams from both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) to gain a new understanding of how adolescents use advanced diabetes technology in real
time for self-management, and to identify potential intervention targets and strategies, 2) Design an ecological
momentary intervention to improve self-management behaviors, 3) Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and
potential efficacy of the new ecological momentary intervention to improve glycemic control. Upon completion,
our team will prepare and submit an R01 proposal for a full-scale trial of the intervention to improve glycemic
control and psychosocial outcomes. Candidate: Dr. DeJonckheere is an adolescent health services
researcher and early career investigator focused on improving health outcomes for adolescents with T1D. Her
career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in real-time assessment to develop theory-
based interventions that optimize use of advanced diabetes technology for self-management. Building on her
experience in educational research and adolescent engagement, this K01 award will support her to develop
and evaluate self-management interventions to improve how adolescents with T1D use diabetes technology in
everyday life. The specific aims are aligned with training aims in the career development plan: 1) develop
expertise in real-time data collection through mobile applications to study how adolescents use advanced
diabetes technology and data; 2) gain skills in the use of natural language processing techniques to rapidly
analyze longitudinal, real-time qualitative data; 3) build skills in the development and testing of evidence- and
theory-based intervention for adolescents with T1D; and 4) acquire knowledge in the biological processes and
standards of care of T1D in adolescence. The career development plan will support Dr. DeJonckheere to
achieve her training goals through dedicated mentorship by a team of leading investigators, advanced didactic
coursework, execution of the proposed research plan, and participation in the broader scientific community.
The University of Michigan, University of Michigan Medical School, and Department of Family Medicine provide
strong institutional support and an excellent environment to complete the proposed career development award."

10745968,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A demonstrable need to train and retain veterinarian-scientists is outlined by several National Research Council
reports (2004, 2005 and 2013) as well as by the National Institutes of Health Physician-Scientist Workforce
Report (2014). In response, the mission of the Comparative Medical Scientist Training Program (CMSTP), is to
prepare post-DVM PhD students to become exceptional veterinarian-scientists in comparative medicine at the
University of California, Davis (UC Davis). This post-doctoral T32, currently in its 34th year, has been very
successful in training veterinarian-scientists for research careers with >90% utilizing their research training.
Specifically, 34 trainees have participated in the program with 9 in faculty positions, 4 in postdoctoral fellowships,
3 in government, 6 in industry, 9 completing their PhD (5 currently in CMSTP), 1 in a clinical residency and only
2 in non-research clinical positions over the past 15 years. To ensure the success of our new trainees, we
propose a comprehensive 4-year CMSTP at UC Davis, which supports 8-9 DVMs/year to pursue their PhD.
Institutional commitment provides 2 students/yr with a summer rotation program, in which they select a research
mentor from 1 of our 36 faculty trainers before entering graduate school. In the first year, students take classes
and prepare for their PhD qualifying exam. Successful students would then receive 1 of 6 three-year T32
fellowships to support their laboratory research in years 2-4 of their graduate career; the School of Veterinary
Medicine (SVM) will support one additional training slot. We will prepare trainees for the next stage of their
careers through provision of research colloquia, individualized mentoring, networking opportunities, and grant
writing workshops. Thus, CMSTP provides a comprehensive, integrated research-mentoring program for DVMs
at UC Davis, particularly those from historically marginalized and disadvantaged backgrounds, to remove
barriers that exist and deter some from pursuing a research career. Over the last funding period, 6 of 14 CMSFP
trainees were from underrepresented groups in science (43%) thus demonstrating our success at and
commitment to recruiting and retaining a diverse body of trainees. The CMSTP takes advantage of outstanding
research and teaching opportunities in the biological sciences at UC Davis by bringing together faculty from the
SVM, the nation’s top veterinary school, the School of Medicine, the College of Engineering, and the College of
Biological Sciences. Most of our training faculty participate in established Centers and Institutes that promote
collaborations and employ diverse evidence-based approaches to solving scientific problems through state-of-
the-art equipment in individual labs as well as campus shared facilities. The objectives of the CMSFP are to: 1)
prepare all of our trainees to become future leaders in academia, government service, public health, and
biomedical research, 2) provide greater exposure to career paths outside academia, 3) maintain the average
time of 4 years to degree, and 4) attract and train a diverse group of veterinarian-scientists."

Students interested in pursuing a career in genome sciences and medicine research will require a strong
foundation of core genome sciences technology, analytical skills, and inter-disciplinary training. The
overarching goal of this renewal application is to continue to provide a high-quality mentored research
experience for promising students in the rapidly growing area of genome sciences and precision medicine. The
10-week summer program centers around a mentored research project in genome sciences and medicine,
supplemented with didactic and interactive training, research seminars and career development skills-building.
The program is open to all under-represented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
who are rising sophomores and juniors. In this renewal, we are expanding our current partnership with North
Carolina Central University (NCCU), an historically black college and university (HBCU), to include three
additional HBCUs in North Carolina to create a core network of students for the summer program. Faculty
mentors for this program span a wide range of disciplines in basic and applied genome sciences, data
sciences, translational genomic medicine, bioinformatics and computational biology, engineering, and
statistics. The research experience will be complemented by a series of research seminars by faculty at Duke
and HBCU partners, and visits to sequencing facilities and companies using genome sciences technologies or
data in their research in nearby Research Triangle Park, and other science-related community service
activities. Given the increased recognition of the importance of data sciences, we are proposing to incorporate
more learning opportunities on data sciences specifically to introduce students to some of these tools and work
with open access datasets. In addition, students will have the opportunity to consider broader issues impacted
by their research through a weekly discussion on the ethical, legal, social, and policy issues and gain important
skills such as critical reading of scientific papers, leading a discussion group, conducting literature reviews, and
making formal presentations. All students will be required to present their research at the conclusion of the
program. We will administer annual surveys to summer scholars to gather information about their educational
and career paths in STEM as a measure of the training program's impact. To date, this R25 program has
supported 24 students over four summers (no students were accepted in summer 2020 due to Covid
restrictions); a majority of students were female and African-American. Several students have successfully
continued on in research throughout their undergraduate career and been accepted into leading graduate
programs and medical schools around the country. With the proposed changes in this renewal application and
our expanded partnerships with other HBCUs in the region, we hope to be responsive to the rapidly changing
science and required skillsets and to increase awareness and recruitment for the program. In summary, we
aim to continue to offer under-represented students a rich and highly interdisciplinary research experience in
genome sciences and medicine."

 This multidisciplinary proposal translates the efforts of a highly skilled group of researchers forging unprecedented
pathways to promote hard and soft dental tissues preservation. Cutting-edge strategies inspired in approaches used in
the medical field are employed to inhibit selectively endogenous metalloproteinases responsible for mediating the
degradation of the collagen. In Dentistry, the destruction of this essential component of the extracellular matrix is strongly
associated with the progression of periodontal disease and the breakdown of the dental substrate/restorative material
interface leading to bacteria recolonization and recurrent caries, the primary cause of failure of dental restorations. These
pathological conditions together are responsible for almost 80% of the tooth extractions in the United States. In order to
address this serious public health issue, two innovative platforms are proposed. The first strategy is based on the
encapsulation of two potent MMP inhibitors, the polyphenols quercetin and epigallocatechin gallate, in nano micelles
cleavable by MMPs. The shell of the particles is composed of peptides with specific sequences of amino acids recognized
and cleaved by the targeted MMPs, leading to rupture of the micelles and the release of the inhibitor molecules. In
essence, this system enables the MMP to inhibit itself. The second strategy is an immunomodulatory platform based on
the introduction of anti-MMP nanobodies, single domain antibodies derived from llama heavy-chain only antibodies, to
inhibit/cease MMP proteolytic activity. As nanoparticles or nanobodies delivery vehicles, a dental primer formulation and
a newly-designed multifunctional hydrogel are used for the adhesive interface and periodontal pockets, respectively. To
validate the designed platforms, tooth-on-a-chip and animal models are being added in order to fast-track their translation
into clinical care. The innovation of this proposal stems from: (1) the employment of a pioneering approach to inactivate
MMPs in dental tissues based on enzymatic-responsive nanoparticles to deliver inhibitors, and (2) the introduction of a
new paradigm based on the modulation of the MMPs activity by nanobody technology. After completing this project, we
will have these two platforms tailored and validated to be delivered in vehicles compatible with the current clinical
techniques employed to treat periodontitis and to hybridize the dentin during the restorative procedures, which will allow
to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and improved patient care. In addition, these platforms can be either
combined or tailored in more complex and multi-functional entities and programmed to respond to a variety of enzymes
and cytokines, which provides new opportunities to develop innovative dental tissue regeneration/preservation
therapeutics to minimize tooth loss especially in highly vulnerable population."
10771143,"ABSTRACT
Although the critical role of Emotional Well-Being (EWB; e.g., life satisfaction, happiness, meaning and
purpose, positive emotions) in public health is increasingly acknowledged, research has lagged due to lack of
consensus on essential components of EWB, valid ways to measure its components, and mechanisms to
inform intervention theory. Mind-body interventions (MBIs) increasingly demonstrate effectiveness in reducing
adverse mental health states, including dysfunction, depression, anxiety, and stress. Whether MBIs are also
effective in promoting EWB, however, remains far less clear. Further, the mechanisms through which MBIs
facilitate EWB and especially how they may work to target EWB across the life course (e.g., children,
caregivers, adults with health challenges) remain largely unknown. To address this crucial gap in knowledge,
we respond to RFA-AT-20-003 in proposing to lead a network to deepen our understanding of EWB
measurement approaches and their role in MBIs as outcomes and as mechanisms. We capitalize on MPIs'
interdisciplinary expertise in MBIs, EWB, measurement, neuroimaging, and inter-generational transmission and
tap our broad network of colleagues across disciplines. To promote research linking MBIs and EWB, new
avenues and resources are needed. First, we need to more fully characterize the dimensions comprising the
umbrella construct of EWB. Second, we need to identify and/or create psychometrically sound instruments that
fully capture these dimensions of wellbeing. Third, we need to identify the biological, psychological, and social
mechanisms through which MBIs promote and maintain EWB. Inclusivity is essential; in addition to the more
typical lifespan approach, we will focus on populations often excluded from this area of work by applying a
developmental and inter-generational transmission lens that includes both child and caregiver populations as
critical to work that moves the field vertically. Capitalizing on this critical moment in intervention science, we will
establish a network that brings together a corps of researchers who can learn from one another's work to
collectively establish innovative and rigorous scientific bases for a new generation of EWB research. The
overarching goal of the network is to provide researchers with the conceptual and methodological resources to
appropriately assess EWB and to promote interdisciplinary research that illuminates the role of EWB in MBIs
as both an outcome itself and as a mechanism in improving mental and physical health outcomes. Specifically,
we will create a taxonomy of components and collection of measures for EWB that spans the life course,
establish a toolkit by refining measurement tools and approaches appropriate for populations across the life
course, and identify potential mechanisms through which MBIs promote EWB. We will achieve these aims
through a series of activities that include targeted strategies to engage a broad network of scholars including
early career, focused meetings for co-learning and sharing findings, and robust multi-media dissemination."

The primary function of the Bioinformatics Core is to provide bioinformatics services and infrastructure for the
MSK research community. This can range from providing complete analysis services beginning with raw data
and ending with publishable results or it can consist of assisting and supporting the growing number of
computational researchers with specific data analyses. A central mission is the creation and maintenance of
both a repository of robust, vetted software applications and pipelines that implement the current state-of-the-
art data analysis and a collection of well documented methods and best-practices. This ensures that critical
analysis steps are done in a reliable, reproducible, and understandable way, freeing the laboratory-based staff
to focus on the analysis that is specific to their particular experiment and saving them time and effort in re-
inventing well known bioinformatics processes. This also leads to a far more cost-effective process with greater
quality control. This consistency enables the institution to provide sharable and consistent results that can be
further used for integrative and pan-group analysis. The Core also plays a central role in training staff in both
methods and in the use of the institution’s high performance computing infrastructure.
Additionally, the Bioinformatics Core provides customized computational and statistical assistance, facilities
collaboration and integrative analysis via data and code sharing, enables access to institutional databases and
provides applications for the creation and curation of research data. The Core trains computational and
bioinformatics staff working in concert with other departments to develop and teach workshops and training
seminars. Finally, the Core works on the research and development of algorithmic best practices, evaluates
current applications and pipelines, and deploys new tools as new experimental methods and assays are
developed."
10818580,"The mammalian cortex is spontaneously active even in the absence of external stimuli. Initially dismissed as
neural noise, pioneering work established that the internal brain states produced by spontaneous activity are
highly structured and responsible for the dramatic variability in both neural and perceptual responses to the same
sensory stimulus. The discovery that varying spontaneous cortical states (SCS) drive different responses to
identical stimuli suggested that altered perceptions of the environment across psychiatry could derive from
aberrant SCS. On this basis, ongoing resting state fMRI studies continue to search for reproducible links between
SCS and psychiatric diagnoses, including schizophrenia, depression, and PTSD, among others. Yet our
fundamental understanding of the cognitive processes and circuit mechanisms underlying SCS remains limited.
One leading theory, drawn from human fMRI recordings during visual detection tasks, suggests that SCS
represent predictions about the environment. In this model, predictive spontaneous cortical states influence
perceptual decision making on the basis of prior beliefs. However, several critical gaps remain in this theory. At
present, there is no causal evidence, either through closed-loop behavior or direct neural modulation, linking
SCS to perceptual decisions. Moreover, the circuit mechanisms of SCS, including the role of interneurons in
producing SCS and specific cortical areas in driving spontaneous cortex-wide states, are completely unknown.
My proposal aims to address these knowledge gaps by investigating SCS in a mouse model. Having trained
mice in a two-alternative forced choice visual detection task, I have applied optical imaging of the dorsal cortex
to find that specific spontaneous states predict behavioral response. Leveraging my preliminary data, I will
investigate how specific interneuron types contribute to SCS (Aim 1), test the causal influence of predictive SCS
over perceptual decisions through a closed-loop behavior (Aim 2), and apply optogenetic modulation of neural
activity to test the role of a specific cortical area, the retrosplenial cortex, in driving predictive SCS (Aim 3).
The proposed studies will offer novel insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying spontaneous
activity, including in human resting state fMRI. In the process, I will supplement my background in human resting
state neuroimaging with critical training in rodent behavior, psychophysics methods, and optogenetics. My
proposal will be guided by a world-class advisory committee consisting of my primary mentor Dr. Karl Deisseroth,
an expert in optogenetics and animal behavior, Dr. Michael Stryker, a mouse visual system expert, Dr. Brian
Wandell, an expert in perceptual decision making, Dr. Robert Malenka, a rodent nervous system expert, and Dr.
Nolan Williams, an expert in human neuromodulation. I will further take full advantage of the vibrant training
environment at Stanford by engaging in targeted coursework and high-quality professional development. By the
end of the fellowship, I will be positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator studying how the
neurocognitive processes embedded in spontaneous activity contribute to psychiatric illness."
10875668,"Project Summary/Abstract
The tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells that reside at barrier tissues respond immediately following pathogen
encounter. Eliciting TRM cells has become a priority in vaccine development to combat infectious diseases and
in cancer immunotherapy. Live attenuated Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb)
will be evaluated here as a new vaccine vector to produce antigen-specific intestinal CD8+ TRM cells. As a rare
pathogen, Yptb causes mostly self-limited mesenteric lymphadenitis in immune competent humans and is
treatable with antibiotics. Sub-lethal infection with Yptb in C57BL/6 mice elicits a large H-2Kb-restricted CD8+ T
cell response specific to bacterial epitope YopE69-77. Following foodborne infection, two different subsets of Yptb-
specific CD8+ TRM cells were identified in intestinal tissues: the scattered CD103+ and the clustered CD103neg
cells. The CD103+ cells depend on transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) and the CD103neg cells require
interferon-b (IFNb) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), inflammatory cytokines mostly generated from CCR2-dependent
cells.
Several unique characteristics of Yptb suggest that this previously overlooked pathogen is at an advantageous
position to be transformed into a vaccine vector. Yptb utilizes a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to inject a set of
6-7 toxic effector proteins, collectively called Yops, from the bacterium directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells
during infection. Injection of these Yop effectors through the Yptb T3SS is contact dependent and following
mouse infection, a high percentage of phagocytes are among the targets. Therefore, the Yptb-based vaccine
vector introduces antigenic proteins directly into the cytosol of phagocytic antigen-presenting cells without the
need to manipulate the genome or transcriptome of eukaryotic cells. Studies are proposed here to initiate
investigation to understand the bacterial and cellular determinants of the two types of TRM generation. In addition,
because the Yop effectors interfere with host immune responses, efforts will be made to attenuate the Yptb-
based vaccine vector and increase its immunogenicity through inactivation of the relevant Yop effectors.
Moreover, because cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response is required to control Yptb even in the presence of protective
antibody response, the possibility that the attenuated Yptb vaccine vector can be introduced repeatedly to elicit
TRM cells with additional antigenic specificity will be evaluated. Accomplishing the studies proposed here will set
the foundation to develop a new type of live attenuated vaccine that is urgently needed for gut TRM cell generation."

(SDoH) as they relate to the use, underuse, and unsafe use of antihypertensive (anti-HTN) medications to
prevent aging-related multimorbidity including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and
cardiovascular disease (CVD). His short-term career goals are to (1) strengthen his mentoring skills in
culturally-sensitive mentoring across a diverse cadre of trainees, (2) learn new skills in the analysis of SDoH
and cognitive, brain structure, and frailty outcomes, and (3) expand infrastructure for anti-HTN
pharmacoepidemiology training at the University of Utah (UU). Mentoring Plan: A central component of his
mentoring program is an individualized approach to training, which includes a needs assessment, individual
development plan, peer-mentoring and writing accountability groups, ongoing intensive evaluation process,
and expansive mentorship network. Research Strategy and Synergy with Career Objectives and
Mentoring Plan: Safe and effective anti-HTN medications prevent morbidity and mortality but are often
underused or misused. Using new knowledge gained through the K24, Dr. Bress leverages his successful
POR program, current funding, and robust institutional resources to create unique training opportunities
through three well-defined, related, and mentee-led POR projects on aging. These studies leverage
existing R01-funded POR using the Systolic Blood Pressure (BP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT), Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, and REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in
Stroke (REGARDS) study. The research aims are to (1) determine the population health impact of intensive
blood pressure (BP) treatment according to SDoH and frailty status using REGARDS, (2) determine
associations among pharmacy deserts, anti-HTN medication use, and BP control in REGARDS, and (3)
determine the association of angiotensin II receptor blocker vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use on
cognitive function and white matter lesion volume in SPRINT and ACCORD. Through these studies, mentees
gain practical experience in (1) conducting and leading aging-related POR in an area that matches their career
goals, (2) manuscript writing and dissemination, and (3) obtaining preliminary data to support their own K/R01
applications. Summary: Dr. Bress's strong commitment to POR in aging-related HTN pharmacoepidemiology,

10792481,"The Superior Colliculus (SC) plays an essential role in processing auditory information to assess saliency
and promote action; however, the underlying cell types and circuitry used to encode sound source locations
remain largely unknown. Work done in primates and ferrets has shown that the receptive fields (RFs) of
neurons in the deep SC (dSC) are organized in a 2-dimensional map of auditory space. This has recently been
shown to also be true in the mouse, an organism that already has molecular and genetic tools available that
will allow us to dissect circuitry to understand how this map forms.
 The overall objective of this application is to determine the functional properties of auditory neurons in the
mouse SC, determine how these properties are encoded, and determine which brainstem and cortical inputs
influence these properties. Our central hypothesis is that a combination of interaural level differences (ILD) and
two sets of spectral cues are used to compute a 2-dimensional map of sound space; these are inherited from
different brainstem regions and are modulated by the cortex. The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to test the
hypothesis that the 2-dimensional map of sound space is encoded by the SC using a combination of ILDs and
two sets of spectral cue patterns. To achieve this we will stimulate awake head-fixed mice, allowed to freely
run on a treadmill, with spatially/temporally/spectrally restricted auditory stimuli, then simultaneously record SC
neuronal response properties of thousands of auditory responsive neurons. Data analysis will determine the
spatiotemporal and spectral/temporal receptive fields (RFs) of auditory neurons, their locations within the SC,
the dependence of their RFs on ILDs and specific frequency combinations, and if these properties are
modulated by locomotion. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the SC
computes sound location by combining inputs from different brainstem nuclei. We will record the response
properties of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, the external nucleus of the IC, and the nucleus of the lateral
lemniscus to auditory stimuli, and compare their RF properties to those in the SC. We will also use
optogenetics to selectively excite or inhibit neurons that project from these areas to the SC in order to identify
their specific contributions to the SC responses. In Specific Aim 3 we test the hypothesis that the direct
projection from the auditory cortex to the SC is used to modulate the response properties of dSC neurons by
measuring the response properties of auditory SC neurons both in mice that lack a cortico-collicular projection,
and in those that have their auditory cortico-collicular projection silenced via optogenetics.
The proposed research plan is significant because the results will establish the mouse SC as a model to study
auditory spatial mapping and eventually auditory/visual spatial integration. Our findings will also lead to a better
understanding of the neuronal circuitry used to compute auditory scenes in the awake behaving animal, and
will shine light on neurodevelopmental disorders that have deficits in the auditory system."
10766141,"The overarching goal of my research program is to identify and characterize molecular mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In most eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria are the primary source of the energy that they provide in the form of ATP by
performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is a two-step process. First, substrate
oxidation by the respiratory chain results in the generation of the electrical potential on the mitochondrial
inner membrane. This potential energy drives generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP at the
ATP synthase complex. To prevent energy dissipation and ensure that OXPHOS is efficient mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability should be tightly controlled and maintained at low levels. Stress conditions
associated with dysregulation of calcium and ROS homeostasis can lead to an increase in mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability – a phenomenon known as Mitochondrial Permeability Transition (mPT).
mPT causes dissipation of the membrane potential and loss of mitochondrial ATP-generating capacity
leading to cell dysfunction and death. mPT is critically involved in a broad spectrum of diseases ranging
from heart attack to neurodegeneration. Prevention of mPT is highly protective against cell death and
tissue damage suggesting high therapeutics potential. However, molecular mechanisms of mPT are not
well understood, and this gap in knowledge prevents mPT from being a drug target. Over the past five
years, we demonstrated that mPT is a multifaceted phenomenon and depending on the disease type and
stress severity, it can occur through different pathways. The central goal of our research program is to
identify the link between specific molecular mechanisms of mPT and specific stress conditions. We have
already established several original animal and cell disease-relevant models causing different types of
mPT. In our approach, a variety of methods that measure the mPT and tissue damage at the organismal,
cellular and mitochondrial levels are coupled with a number of our original electrophysiological (patch-
clamp) assays that allow direct measurement of mPT at the level of mitochondrial membranes and give
us a unique opportunity to dissect and characterize its multiple identities and regulation. The results of
our study will provide a detailed understanding of one of the most critical events in cell death cascades
and will bring an essential framework for the development of therapeutically approaches that will
selectively target mPT."
10778543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Effective contractile force in muscle requires the proper assembly, regulation, and activation of actin-containing
thin filaments. Leiomodins (Lmods) are a family of actin-binding proteins that regulate assembly of actin
filaments through a single tropomyosin-binding and multiple actin-binding domains. We previously discovered
that both knockout and overexpression of the cardiac predominant isoform (Lmod2) alters the lengths of thin
filaments in vivo and results in cardiomyopathy. Our extensive preliminary data suggest that Lmod2 impacts
contractile function - independent of actin-thin filaments length regulation. With a plethora of unique
experimental tools in hand, the goal of this proposal is to definitively determine the mechanisms of how
mutations in LMOD2 lead to heart failure.
 It is becoming increasingly clear that the Lmod family of proteins play a critical role in muscle function;
mutations in any of the three LMOD isoforms lead to debilitating human diseases. In this proposal, we describe
the first known human mutation in LMOD2. This mutation leads to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. All
LMOD-linked diseases have the common underlying pathophysiology of severe muscle weakness due to
reduced contractility. Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense or
frameshift mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of
disease little to no LMOD protein is expressed. Extensive preliminary data suggests that nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay underlies the loss of mutant LMOD2 protein, which we can restore using LMOD2-specific
antisense oligonucleotides.
 We hypothesize that Lmod2 is a multifunctional protein that influences cardiac contractility through
maintaining proper thin filament lengths and positively effecting activation of the thin filament. We propose a
multidisciplinary approach utilizing a unique combination of in vitro assays, patient-specific induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), and novel models of human disease to accomplish two Specific
Aims focused on determining: 1) the fundamental function(s) of Lmod2, particularly how Lmod2 regulates thin
filament assembly and what role it has in cardiac contractility, and 2) why human mutations in LMOD2 lead to a
lack of protein expression, how loss of protein leads to disease, and whether restoring full-length or truncated
LMOD2 can prevent (rescue) the onset of cardiomyopathy. Elucidating the in vivo function(s) of Lmod2 will
provide critical missing links in our understanding of muscle contraction. In addition, these studies will have a
broad impact on understanding the etiology and potential treatments of a spectrum of diseases that result from
mutations in the LMOD family of genes, as well as other diseases that involve nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay of essential proteins."
10798158,"Title: Role of E-cadherin down-regulation in prostatic inflammation and lower urinary tract dysfunction
Summary:
 Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common disease conditions in older men. Its
symptoms significantly impact quality of life and treatment costs over $4 billion annually. The proposed study
will focus on histological glandular BPH and associated LUTS. About half of the men with histological BPH are
asymptomatic, and not all patients with LUTS or clinical BPH have large prostate. Histological BPH can lead to
clinical BPH or LUTS as men age. How histological glandular BPH leads to clinical BPH or LUTS is not clear.
Our preliminary studies showed prostatic secretion is leaked into the stroma of all tested glandular BPH,
reflecting compromised epithelial cell-cell junctions in BPH. This observation is consistent with down-regulation
of E-cadherin, a key protein required for cell-cell junction formation, in glandular BPH specimens. To evaluate
the role of E-cadherin down-regulation, we generated an inducible prostate luminal epithelial cell specific E-
cadherin gene (Cdh1) knockout mouse model. In this model, Cdh1 heterozygosity caused prostatic
inflammation, prostatic proliferation, and bladder overactivity, which are 3 key phenotypes associated with
BPH/LUTS. Importantly, these phenotypes were developed in old but not young mice, making these mice an
ideal model for this age-related disease. To explore the mechanisms of E-cadherin down-regulation in BPH,
our preliminary study revealed altered/elevated androgen signaling in BPH epithelial cells and androgen
suppression of E-cadherin expression in explants derived from BPH but not from normal prostate. The above
preliminary data led to our hypothesis that E-cadherin down-regulation in BPH predisposes prostate to
developing inflammation and subsequent bladder overactivity via afferent nerve sensitization. Based
on this hypothesis, we propose the following 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the molecular and cellular
alterations caused by luminal epithelial E-cadherin loss in the prostate of a mouse model – role of prostatic
inflammation. Aim 2 will determine the prostate-to-bladder afferent cross-sensitization mechanisms inducing
bladder overactivity and the effects of COX-2 inhibition or androgen blockade in Cdh1 KO mice. Aim 3 will
determine the roles of altered androgen signaling and inflammatory cytokines in E-cadherin down-regulation in
BPH epithelial cells. The success of the proposed project will provide insights into the causes and effects of E-
cadherin down-regulation in glandular BPH, which will help guide future studies to develop and optimize
therapeutics that could restore E-cadherin expression and/or suppress prostatic inflammation and related
pathways in BPH/LUTS management."
10757702,"ABSTRACT
There are clear circadian rhythms in the behavioral patterns of mammals and circadian disruption is one of the
most common co-morbidities in neuropsychiatric disorders. Behaviors themselves are instantiated via
electrophysiologic activity, such as neuronal action potentials or “spiking” and oscillations. However, we do not
know how circadian behavioral rhythms are brought about by electrophysiologic changes. To study the
circadian modulation of brain electrophysiology, rodent-based neuroscientific methods offer a powerful
platform, since they include tools to probe and record the electrical activity of neural circuits chronically, and in
great detail. Unfortunately, while humans are diurnal, the animal models used in neuroscience tend to be
nocturnal and therefore do not allow us to easily translate findings to humans. This is because nocturnal
animals do not simply represent phase-reversed versions of diurnal animals – there are non-linear differences
between nocturnal and diurnal animals in how brainwide neural circuits couple to the circadian pacemaker.
Therefore, to understand how neural circuits are modulated over the 24-hour cycle in a diurnal brain, we
propose to perform circadian timescale electrophysiologic recordings in a diurnal rodent. We will record from
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region with both known import in rodent behavior and relation to human
psychiatric conditions including seasonal affective disorder (SAD) which is heavily affected by alterations in
circadian light patterns. For these long-timescale questions we will use non-traditional electrophysiologic
analytics amenable to chronic and non-stimulus locked quantification – an approach we call “Electrophysiologic
Background State” (EBS). This EBS approach will include a number of metrics of detailed spiking dynamics in
the mPFC amenable to analysis over sustained periods. These include excitatory-inhibitory balance and spike
rate variance which we have been suggested to be circadian modulated either in literature or our preliminary
data. Our hypothesis is that in diurnal species, EBS metrics in medial prefrontal cortex including population
spike rate variability and EI balance show daily rhythms that predict behavioral patterns. To test this hypothesis,
we propose to develop the first-ever chronic high-density electrophysiology in diurnal rodents using our
combination of expertise with diurnal Nile grass rat neurobiology (Yan) and rodent electrophysiology (Watson).
We propose to implant a 64-channel probe into the mPFC and then record for 96-hour periods in diurnal grass
rats. We will measure the spike rate variance and excitatory-inhibitory ratio to determine circadian modulation
of these measures. In the first aim we will determine light versus circadian modulation of any observed EBS
rhythms. In the second aim we will use reduced daylight to induce behavioral changes as in SAD patients and
will then correlate behavioral changes with EBS changes within the same animals. This work will study in vivo
electrophysiologic modulation of neural networks in diurnal rodents for the first time. Future work can explore
in more detail both healthy and pathological electrophysiology of diurnal rodents."
10751024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii can cause recurring opportunistic infections due to its ability to persist
as a latent form (bradyzoite) within patients. There is no treatment that targets bradyzoite cysts, which reconvert
into the destructive proliferative stage (tachyzoites) in the immune compromised. Patients suffering from
reactivated toxoplasmosis frequently present with life-threatening neurological problems, underscoring the
significance of bradyzoite cysts in the brain. A better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the
development of bradyzoites in neurons is necessary to devise new therapies that prevent their formation and
persistence. To address this need, we developed a novel model of spontaneous tissue cyst formation in neurons
using Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells. We will use this innovative system to determine the
mechanisms underlying the changes in protein synthesis that are required for bradyzoite formation. Based on
our previous collaborative work, we hypothesize that translation initiation factors coordinate changes in
5’-leader sequences of key mRNAs, resulting in changes in protein synthesis that induce conversion to
bradyzoites. Translation begins with the binding of an eIF4F complex to the 5’-cap, which then recruits eIF2,
which carries Met-tRNA. We previously showed TgIF2 is phosphorylated during bradyzoite conversion, which
lowers its abundance and can alter start codon selection. Aim 1 will determine how TgIF2 becomes
phosphorylated and which mRNAs are preferentially translated during spontaneous bradyzoite conversion in
neurons. Our RiboSeq approach will reveal areas within 5’-leaders that regulate translation, such as upstream
open reading frames (uORFs) or secondary structures, the latter of which will be identified by generating the first
RNA “structurome” for Toxoplasma in Aim 2. As these structures are resolved by helicase activity of eIF4F, Aim
2 will also delineate the functions of the multiple TgIF4F complexes we have uncovered in the parasites.
Together, these studies will determine how cellular signals coordinate translation initiation factors to reprogram
the translatome to trigger the spontaneous formation of bradyzoites in human neurons. Completion of this study
will have a sustained high impact on the field by providing significant new insights into the complex mechanisms
that Toxoplasma uses to persists in its host, which will reveal novel points for therapeutic intervention."
10791746,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Until recently, it was thought that our memories occur as a reactivation of perception – reconjuring the same
visual information and neural patterns (dubbed the sensory reinstatement hypothesis; e.g., Buckner &
Wheeler, 2001). However, in recent work, we observed surprising differences between perception and
memory, with separate brain voxels and patterns involved in each process (Bainbridge et al., 2021b). We
observed that memory representations in the brain lose rich high-level visual information, and that the neurons
sensitive to memory are anterior to those sensitive to perception. Here, we hypothesize that memories
become more semanticized representations of perception, resulting in an anterior neural shift towards
more semantic regions (Popham et al., 2021); we dub this the semantic transformation hypothesis. This
hypothesis runs counter to a recent proposal that memory and perception are supported by two separate yet
adjacent networks (the separate networks hypothesis, Steel et al., 2021). By testing these three hypotheses
in conjunction, we will be able to identify the specific neural mechanisms that support visual memory
and its relation to visual perception. Crucially, this project has critical importance for understanding memory
disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease, for which recent work has shown that visual and semantic information
in an image can predict its eventual memory fate in a patient (Bainbridge et al., 2019a; Grande et al., 2021).
 Towards this question, we utilize innovative methods pioneered by our laboratory, including a direct read-out
of a participant’s perception and memory through drawings that are quantified through online crowd-
sourcing (Bainbridge et al., 2019a; Bainbridge, 2021). In Aim 1, we use drawings to identify the direct
influences of visual and semantic information on visual memory representations. In Aim 2, we use
representational similarity analyses (Bainbridge et al., 2021b) combined with functional magnetic resonance
imaging to test the roles of visual and semantic information on memory patterns in the brain. Importantly, in
addition to testing typical individuals, we also study the newly characterized phenomenon of congenital
aphantasia (2-5% prevalence), which describes individuals with no visual memory yet intact visual perception
and semantic memory (Zeman et al., 2015; Keogh & Pearson, 2018). Aphantasia serves as natural “knock-
out” case to observe behavioral and neural differences between perception and memory, and our
laboratory is the only laboratory in the U.S. to have studied the condition thus far (Bainbridge et al.,
2021a). Armed with this unique population, in Aim 3, we will identify the neural substrates that underlie their
dissociation of visual memory and vision, and test the role of semantic vs. visual content on memory.
 In sum, this study promises to resolve our understanding of how what we see becomes what we remember,
by identifying the causes of these striking differences observed in the brain between perception and memory."

The purpose of the proposed IMSD Program at the University of Texas at San Antonio is to recruit and train a diverse group
of doctoral students in the biomedical and behavioral (collectively termed biomedical) sciences from underrepresented
groups (UR). The program will develop and implement evidence-based approaches upon foundations of the UTSA RISE
program and enhance our trainees' recruitment, retention; depth of professional, operational, and technical Training; and
career path trajectory. The program will promote UR students' recruitment and admission, retention, and mentoring
support during their doctoral studies that guide them towards biomedical careers. It will support trainees in the Biomedical
Engineering, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Cell, and Molecular Biology, Physics, and Psychology Ph.D. programs. Eight new
Ph.D. students will be inducted annually and mentored for three years; 56 students are expected to receive Training over
the five years of the program. The proposed interventions will enhance UR admission to 40%, promote 85% retention of
its trainees and reduce time-to-degree from 4.8 to 4.6 years. Training focusing on Psychosocial Wellness, Mentoring,
Career Development, and Instruction in Methods for Enhancing Reproducibility are integrated throughout the training
cycle. The IMSD program has key features that make it innovative. IMSD Training is stage-dependent, with sessions each
summer designed to focus trainees' attention on critical milestones of the following year; some training will be provided
earlier to Psychology students who are in a 3-year program. It leverages institutional resources, with partnerships in place
for trainees to receive Training from the UTSA Career Center, Leadership and Volunteer Services and Wellbeing Services,
the UTSA Office of Research Integrity, and Graduate School. IMSD Training is progressive. Training begins with
foundational topics designed to ""level the playing field"" and provide foundations for all subsequent Training. IMSD
attempts to minimize trainee time commitment in the fall and spring semesters. All multi-session workshops will be taught
in the summer, except first-semester foundational Training. Academic year training and presentations are associated with
the multi-focus Weekly Group Sessions that incorporate Psychosocial Training, Alumni and Role Model Scientist Visits,
introductory Training in Budgeting, Leadership, Clifton StrengthsFinder, and College-Level Teaching. Mentoring is a
significant component of the IMSD, involving being mentored by other scientists at diverse career stages and fields.
Trainees will have multiple opportunities to practice their scientific communication skills in progressively rigorous
environments. These include poster, oral, and Three Minute Thesis presentations."
10758602,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, and it is the sixth leading cause
of death in the United States. AD currently cannot be prevented, cured, or even slowed, and it has a significant
public health impact in terms of health care dollars and quality of life for those affected and their family members.
Experimental models of ADRD have implicated the gut microbiome-bile acid-brain axis in the development and
progression of ADRD. Neurotoxic environmental toxicants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), alter the
function of the microbiome, resulting in an altered bile acid homeostasis; however, it is unknown if PCB-mediated
changes in the gut microbiome-bile acid-brain axis play a role in the etiology of ADRD. Furthermore,
epidemiological studies have major limitations assessing the complex effects of PCB exposure on the gut
microbiome-bile acid-brain axis across the lifespan. Thus, there is a critical need to assess how human-relevant
PCB mixtures alter the development and progression of ADRD-like phenotypes in experimental models of
ADRD via the gut microbiome-bile acid-brain axis. The long-term goal of the transdisciplinary team assembled
for this project is to characterize how environmental exposures contribute to ADRD and ultimately prevent ADRD
through a precision environmental health paradigm. The translational objective is to demonstrate with a systems
biology approach that exposure to a human-relevant PCBs mixture contributes to and accelerates the etiology
of ADRD-type outcomes in vivo. The central hypothesis is that exposure to PCBs adversely affects the ADRD
phenotype in rTg4510 and APP/PS1 mice, two experimental models of ADRD, by causing microbiome-mediated
alterations in the bile acid homeostasis and affecting vascular function in a dose and exposure time-dependent
manner. This hypothesis integrates strong preliminary data from the research team showing that PCBs are
present in the human brain, affect the microbiome, alter bile acid homeostasis, and cause vascular dysfunction.
The hypothesis will be tested using a systems biology approach by assessing how exposure to a human-relevant
PCB mixture affects ADRD-related outcomes in experimental models of ADRD. The Specific Aims are to a)
characterize effects of PCB exposure on gut microbiome composition and circulating bile acids; b) study the
effects of PCB exposure on vascular function, and c) identify ADRD-type pathological changes and memory loss
in the brain of PCB exposed rTg4510 or APP/PS1 mice. To ensure integration across all Aims, mediation analysis
will be used to demonstrate that the microbiome and/or vascular dysfunction mediates the effects of PCBs on
ADRD-type outcomes. These studies will demonstrate that PCB exposure leads to accelerated progression and
more severe disease pathology in experimental ADRD models. Identifying PCBs as environmental risk factors
that alter ADRD-related outcomes will lay the groundwork for mechanistic studies and inform translational studies
for preventing ADRD mediated by environmental toxicants using a precision environmental health paradigm."
10770434,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core provides the overall scientific leadership and management for the HNRC, with a primary
aim of ensuring integrated, coherent, and effective scientific operations. Within the Core, the Executive Team
provides programmatic leadership and oversight of the Center regarding resource allocation and future research
directions and projects. The decisions of the Executive Team are informed by both external and internal formal
review, advice and feedback. The external Scientific Advisory Board meets annually to evaluate Center progress
and to recommend future scientific directions. Internally, the Council of Investigators sets policy and closely
monitors scientific progress. Valued local input to the Executive Team also comes from the Community Advisors
(community providers, advocates, and leaders) and Participant Advisors (study participants). The leadership’s
key decision-making functions are implemented via four interacting components: the Coordinating Unit, which
has overall responsibility for executing and coordinating Center activities, including organizing the distribution of
Center resources, facilitating information dissemination to scientific and general communities, and ensuring
compliance with institutional and Federal policies; the Data Management and Informations System Unit, which
processes all Center-related data, ensures seamless interaction among Cores and associated projects, and
supports Center websites, videoconferencing, and mobile and online assessment applications; the Statistics
Unit, which provides statistical services at all study stages, from design to final analyses and manuscript
preparation; and the Participant Accrual and Retention Unit, which recruits cohorts of interest, maintains the
longitudinal cohort, and manages a registry of potential study participants. Each of these Units also engages in
methods development. In addition, strong working groups assist and guide the Core: the Research Review
Committee reviews requests for Center resources and serves as a venue for the discussion of current and
proposed studies and manuscripts; the HNRC Operations Workgroup, in which key managers and project
coordinators address project implementation and troubleshooting; and the Human Subjects Committee, which
monitors human subjects and Institutional Review Board issues, particularly relating to safeguarding
confidentiality. The structures and processes of the Core ensure the operation of a truly multidisciplinary research
center and foster a wide-ranging nimbleness and responsiveness, not only to priorities announced at the national
level by policy (e.g., the NIH) and those expressed by the national neuroHIV research community (e.g., our
nation-wide collaborating universities), but also within our home institution (e.g., HNRC scientific Core leaders,
other UCSD HIV research groups)."
10770440,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: DEVELOPMENTAL CORE
The Developmental Core (DC) will aim to support innovative pilot research to foster the academic careers of new
investigators in neuroHIV research by capitalizing on UCSD’s unique training environment and opportunities;
and to support refinement of neuroHIV hypotheses and methods, resulting in better understanding of
pathogenesis and treatment of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS). The DC will primarily accomplish these
aims via its Developmental Grant Program and by assisting new investigators in navigating the substantial range
of HNRC-linked research resources, such as those from six ongoing training programs: Interdisciplinary
Research Fellowship in NeuroHIV (R25 MH081482); Training in Research on Addictions in Interdisciplinary
NeuroHIV (T32 DA031098); Sustained Training in Aging and HIV Research (R25 MH108389); the UCSD
HIV/AIDS Training Program (T32 AI007384); the UCSD Masters of Advanced Studies in Clinical Research
program; and the UCSD/SDSU Joint Doctoral Program. In the current funding cycle, the DC awarded 14
developmental grants to new investigators. In addition, the DC assisted with training 28 new investigators in
neuroHIV research methods. For the renewal, we propose to continue to fund innovative, interdisciplinary, and
translational research projects that a) align with the HNRC’s scientific themes and the Office of AIDS Research’s
priorities and b) are likely to lead to future research grant applications. We will continue to work with the San
Diego CFAR to provide feedback to new investigators on their grant applications and will continue to link
investigators to resources at the HNRC and UCSD. The DC will continue to be led by Drs. Letendre, Bharti, and
McCutchan. The Core will work with the Administrative Core, the HNRC Scientific Core Directors, and the San
Diego Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) to incorporate new elements, including training in grant application

to submission, and a clearinghouse for new requests for applications and program announcements."
10770445,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: MICROBIOME CORE
 The Microbiome (MIBI) Core plays an essential role in the HNRC by enabling researchers to investigate the
emerging, complex links between the gut microbiome, HIV, associated comorbidities, and biological mechanisms
involved in neurocognitive impairment (NCI), mood disorders, and more complex neurobehavioral phenotypes
that include both. In recent years, the gut microbiome has been strongly associated with neurologic and mood
disorders in individual studies, although few studies have considered them together, and none in the context of
HIV. In particular, questions about how HIV infection and ART may impact gut barrier dysfunction and central
nervous system sequelae from a microbiome perspective have not been well studied. However, detailed
mechanistic accounts of how the microbiome is involved in depression and Type 2 diabetes, and interacts with
viral infection in a non-HIV context, strongly motivate such studies. The main goal of MIBI is therefore to make
microbiome and metabolome technology broadly available to HNRC investigators, allowing us to go beyond the
16S rRNA profiling from the NeuroGerm (NG) core in the previous funding period, and focusing on microbiome-
related mechanisms of mood and cognitive changes in people with HIV (PWH). To provide insight beyond
taxonomic profiling, we will use advanced shotgun metagenomics techniques to read out and assemble bacterial
and viral genomes from stool and plasma, and relate these to chemical profiles from untargeted metabolomics,
which will also capture drugs and their downstream metabolites and allow us to connect these processes to the
microbiome in PWH. Because the microbiome is known to be affected by host genetics, and is likely to interact
with viral genotype and titer, close interaction with the other Cores will be essential for enabling researchers to
make progress on these questions that require complex multidisciplinary study designs. Additionally, because
analysis of highly multivariate microbiome and metabolome data is challenging, an important goal of MIBI will be
to provide bioinformatics support and training in how to integrate these data layers with each other and with
clinical data important to furthering these scientific aims. The result will be a better understanding of how the
microbiome influences and is influenced by long-term HIV infection and co-infections, and how microbiome and
metabolome changes may influence individual responses to treatments for HIV and associated conditions
(including depressive states and NCI), and ultimately contribute to improved strategies for long-term
management of HIV that take the microbiome into account to reduce long-term comorbidities."
10757006,"Studies in this proposal will define the role of this cholinergic innervation of the liver in
controlling glucose and lipid metabolism. The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) contains
parasympathetic cholinergic neurons. Although there is a contradictory finding of the lack of
cholinergic innervation to the mouse liver, prior studies with the retrograde neuronal tracers
such as cholera toxin B, pseudorabies virus, and AAV encoding a Cre-inducible reporter protein
strongly support that the mouse liver receives DMV cholinergic innervation. Furthermore, we
have recently published peer reviewed work demonstrating that hepatocytes receive direct
DMV cholinergic input and express muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, suggesting that the
hepatic cholinergic system is critical for proper liver function.
 In our recent studies, optogenetic excitation of cholinergic fibers innervating the liver
reduces blood glucose, consistent with the ability of parasympathetic efferent outflow to the
liver to suppress hepatic glucose output. Conversely, optogenetic silencing of liver-projecting
cholinergic nerves elevates blood glucose levels and also stimulates the expression of key
hepatic gluconeogenic genes. As there is no change in plasma glucagon that drives hepatic
glucose production, this effect appears to be pancreatic hormone-independent. In contrast to
the traditional view that the activation of sympathetic nerves promotes, while the
parasympathetic innervation suppresses, hepatic glucose output, our recently published work
strongly supports the significant contribution of DMV cholinergic neurons to hepatic glucose
output in lean mice. Importantly, our pilot studies reveal that ablation of liver-projecting
cholinergic neurons increases hepatic lipolysis and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a high-fat
diet. As hepatic gluconeogenesis and intrahepatic lipolysis are closely linked to each other,
studies in Aim 1 will identify the necessity of these neurons in the control of ingestive
behaviors and hepatic energy metabolism in lean and diet-induced obese mice.
 Despite the importance of parasympathetic cholinergic neurons to the regulation of
hepatic glucose output via both insulin-dependent and -independent ways, it is not known that
glucose sensing is an important physiological trigger for this DMV- liver neural circuit. To
address this major gap, studies in Aim 2 will determine if glucose-sensing by DMV liver-
projecting cholinergic neurons controls cholinergic tone to the liver.
 While high-fat feeding elevates hepatic sympathetic nerve activity, diet-induced obesity
(DIO) reduces action potential firing of parasympathetic motor neurons. Thus, we have begun
to probe if the hepatic cholinergic system is subject to modulation by the nutrient status. Our
pilot studies reveal that high-fat feeding upregulates Gi-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor type 2 (M2R) and 4 (M4R) expression in the liver. Accordingly, studies in Aim 3 will
test the hypothesis that diet-induced alterations in the hepatic cholinergic system disrupt whole-
body energy homeostasis and hepatic energy metabolism, causing insulin resistance and
hepatic steatosis in DIO."

My long term goal is to comprehensively understand the diversity, heterogeneity and functions of bacterial
epigenomes both in terms of basic science and biomedical impact. In the bacterial world, methylated adenine
and cytosine residues was previously thought to be only associated with restriction-modification systems that
provide a defense mechanism against invading foreign genomes. However, increasing evidence supports that
they also play important roles in the regulation of cell cycle, gene expression, virulence, sporulation, biofilm
formation, microbe-host interaction and antibiotic resistance. Efficient and high resolution profiling of bacterial
DNA methylation events has not been possible until the advent of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT)
sequencing. This technique enabled us to characterize the first bacterial methylome at single nucleotide
resolution. A fast growing number of bacteria are being characterized, from which exciting discoveries have
been made. However, these studies have also revealed unexpected complexity and diversity in bacterial
methylomes, calling for the development new technologies, analytical and experimental methods in order to
more comprehensively understand bacterial epigenomes. In this R35 project, we will build on the progress we
have made in the past five years to further develop an integrated research program with a broader scope
integrating two ongoing focused R01 projects. The overarching theme is focused on the mapping,
characterization and exploitation of bacterial methylomes to better understand individual bacteria and
microbiome community. We will develop this research program along four complementary themes. First, to
more comprehensively map bacterial methylome, we will continue to innovate on technology development to
make significant improvements both in terms of in terms of completeness and resolution. Second, to better
elucidate epigenetic regulation in bacteria, we will combine computational and experimental approaches to
prioritize and functionally characterize specific methylation events across different bacterial organisms. Third,
to systematically expand bacterial methylome research from cultured individual bacteria to microbiome, we will
characterize bacterial epigenetics in response to different types of perturbations. Last, we will provide the
software we develop as an integrated package to ease broad usage, and organize relevant conference
tutorials to help the broader community. Combined together, we expect this project to provide broadly
applicable methods to the microbiology and microbiome community, and discover novel biological insights into
epigenetic regulation in individual bacteria and microbiome."
10764266,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the last twenty years, an increasing number of agricultural communities have faced an apparently new,
unexplained, and fatal kidney disease, known as chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). First
noted in sugar cane workers in El Salvador and rice farmers in Sri Lanka, reports of a similar kidney disease
have emerged come from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, India, and (most recently) the U.S. Despite the
scale and severity of this kidney disease epidemic, the epidemiological and mechanistic investigations needed
to address it have been extremely limited. Because persons with the disease are otherwise healthy agricultural
workers, many experts and the affected population suspect agrochemical exposure is responsible. In two key
preliminary studies from Sri Lanka, we find that agricultural workers are drinking from shallow water wells that
are contaminated by organophosphate and organochlorine agrochemicals above EPA drinking water
regulations, and well water consumption raises likelihood of biopsy-proven CKDu and faster progression of
established kidney disease. In a cohort of 600 at-risk participants identified by our preliminary work in whom
we will obtain baseline environmental samples including water samples and kidney biopsies if they meet a
validated clinical definition of CKDu, we propose to examine the hypothesis that specific agrochemicals
contaminating well water are causing CKDu. We will: 1) run untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry
analysis of well water, 2) determine the association of individual agrochemicals and their mixtures with incident
CKDu case status, accounting for work intensity and heat stress, 3) measure the bioburden of nephrotoxic
agrochemicals in cases versus controls, and 4) perform molecular analyses of early-stage kidney biopsies to
specify the injury response pattern at a cellular level with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. In alignment
with NIDDK-NIEHS-Fogarty recommended approach to CKDu investigations, this proposal integrates a multi-
disciplinary, multi-national team of nephrologists, pathologists, molecular biologists and environmental
geochemists. Based on our preliminary data we focus on agrochemical exposure via well water as the
environmental risk factor of interest in this proposal, however field work will be coupled with an extensive
biobanking effort to facilitate testing of multiple candidate hypotheses. The complementary molecular analyses
will precisely characterize the injury in CKDu in the context of other primary tubulointerstitial kidney diseases,
and create a rigorous scaffold for testing potential agents that can trigger CKDu-specific responses in the
kidney. As in the case of prior regional kidney disease epidemics such as Balkan nephropathy, the intensive
effort to identify cause in our outlined aims has the potential to pinpoint other vulnerable populations and
regions, and more importantly, to abrogate the kidney disease by eliminating the exposure."

parasites. The overall goal of this project is to investigate proteins in insect hemolymph plasma
that participate in different aspects of insect immunity. Previous work from this laboratory has
established the lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta, as a model system well suited for
biochemical characterization of the complex functions of hemolymph proteins. In our work over
the next five years, we plan to investigate three aspects of immunity that are mediated by
plasma proteins. (1) We will characterize interactions of plasma proteins with peptidoglycan
from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria that trigger activation of a serine protease,
thereby initiating protease cascades that result in activation of phenoloxidase and the Toll
pathway. (2) We will investigate how the redox environment of hemolymph is regulated during
an immune response and test a hypothesis that immune proteins may be regulated by thiol
modifications. (3) Mammals have well-characterized mechanisms for depriving invading
microorganisms of iron; however, immune-related iron-withholding in insects is still poorly
understood. We will use M. sexta as a model for discovering conserved iron-withholding
mechanisms in insects. The fundamental biochemical knowledge gained as a result of this
research is expected to stimulate better understanding of regulation of protease cascade
pathways and molecules in insect hemolymph that contribute to oxidative modulation during
immunity, and lead to understanding of how iron influences human disease transmission by
insect vectors."

Key metabolites from microbiota, probiotics and diet can inhibit the virulence properties of enteric pathogens,
but their mechanisms of action are unclear and limit the development of new anti-infectives. To determine the
mechanism(s) of action of prominent microbiota metabolites (short chain fatty acids, aromatic amino acids, bile
acids and others), multi-disciplinary approaches are needed to biochemically identify metabolite-protein targets
in enteric pathogens and characterize their activity on infections in vivo. My laboratory will therefore employ
innovative methods in chemical biology, proteomics and gene editing in bacteria to elucidate how specific
metabolites attenuates enteric pathogen infections. A better understanding of how these metabolites affects the
virulence properties of bacterial pathogens should reveal potential therapeutic targets and facilitate the
development of new anti-infectives to combat bacterial pathogens in animals and humans."

Ewing sarcoma survival has not improved in decades despite long knowledge of its singular driving somatic
mutation, the pernicious EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein. As an aberrant transcription factor EWS-FLI1 alters
expression of thousands of genes enacting a complex program toxic to most cell types, so much so that the cell
of origin for Ewing sarcoma is still a matter of debate. Ewing sarcoma occurs at starkly higher rates (roughly 10-
fold) in children of European ancestry compared to those with primarily African ancestry, while Latino children
have roughly ⅔ and Asian children ½ the risk of Ewing sarcoma than do white children. Ancestry is in fact the
strongest known risk factor for Ewing sarcoma, but the molecular basis of these differences in risk have been
investigated only sparingly. As the mechanisms by which EWS-FLI1 interacts with the genome have become
clear, it is feasible with an appropriate model to investigate how genomic ancestry in general and at specific loci
modulates EWS-FLI1 activity including its downstream effects on epigenetic and transcriptional programs. To
this end we have devised a strategy to introduce EWS-FLI1 in derivatives of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)
in order to characterize downstream molecular and functional consequences of EWS-FLI1 expression. Using
accessible variant array data from several large stem cell repositories we identified banked iPSC lines derived
from individuals with a range of European, African, and Amerind ancestry. We will introduce EWS-FLI1
expression at intermediate stages of development relevant to Ewing sarcomagenesis—namely neural crest cells
and mesenchymal stem cells. Measures of functional tolerance and molecular state will be compared to
corresponding samples from subjects with solely European ancestry. Globally we will examine whether gene
expression and chromatin state exhibits similarity to the Ewing expression signature in proportion to European
ancestry percentage. Genome-wide chromatin occupancy of EWS-FLI1 will be profiled and its relationship to
local ancestry defined using long-read sequencing. Genes that are differentially influenced by EWS-FLI1 in
“permissive” (European ancestry), “moderately permissive” (Amerind ancestry) and “impermissive” (African
ancestry) genomes will be considered targets of potential therapeutic value and will undergo validation using
CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and functional assays. The resulting data will represent the first and only
effort, to our knowledge, to take advantage of the known differences in risk for Ewing sarcoma by ancestry to
study EWS-FLI1 binding and downstream effects. In addition, we will make available the genome-scale data
produced by our study and freely distribute our iPSC models for wider use by Ewing sarcoma researchers."

HIV and HBV are both recognized as major global health concerns. HIV infects 37 million people worldwide,
while HBV infects 257 million. HIV/HBV co-infection is common due to highly similar routes of transmission, with
an estimated 10% of HIV-infected individuals also infected with HBV. In addition to their similar sexual and
percutaneous routes of transmission, HIV and HBV also share the ability to drive chronic infection, liver
dysfunction, liver fibrosis, and immune exhaustion. For these reasons, co-infection with HIV and HBV is
associated with higher probabilities of health complications, particularly liver fibrosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).
HIV infected patients are up to 6-times more likely to progress to chronic HBV infection and have higher levels
of HBV viremia. The mechanisms contributing to the increased liver dysfunction and fibrosis seen in HIV/HBV
co-infected individuals are not currently understood. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed, but the ability to
study these hypotheses is hindered by lack of a robust HBV infection model. Thus, there remains an urgent need
to develop novel, physiologically relevant models of HIV/HBV co-infection to study the interaction between these
viruses.
Here, we present the first rhesus macaque model of HBV infection and propose an urgently needed,
physiologically relevant HIV/HBV co-infection animal model. We believe that our new rhesus macaque model of
HBV infection will be on the forefront of HBV research, and is becoming available at a crucial time where efforts
are now turning towards cure strategies for both HIV and HBV. Given the urgent need for tractable animal models
of HIV/HBV co-infection, we believe the research proposed herein to be of the highest significance."
10767834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infancy is increasingly being recognized as a key time point of microbiome establishment that impacts
neonatal health as well as later outcomes. The intestinal microbiome has specifically been implicated in
neurologic outcomes via the gut-brain axis. However, means by which the intestinal microbiome can have
influence on the brain are poorly understood. The preterm infant is at the nexus of these unknowns. Preterm
infants are a vulnerable patient population at risk for significant poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Preterm infant brain development occurs in parallel with intestinal microbiome development, thus modification
of the intestinal microbiome is a potential means of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal,
we will test the hypothesis that distinct gut microbiome taxa and metabolites at key time points improve
preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.
 Our preliminary and published data in gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that different early
preterm infant microbiota impact neuron number, myelination, and behavior. This proposal will use our ongoing
MIND (Microbiome In Neonatal Development) preterm infant cohort to determine how the gut microbiome
impacts neurodevelopmental potential in the NICU, and how it may alter neurodevelopmental trajectories post-
NICU discharge. We will conduct longitudinal sampling of participant fecal and blood samples to monitor gut
microbiome as well as fecal and serum metabolites. We will also perform neurodevelopmental testing during
the NICU course and up until preschool/school age (3.5-5 years old). School readiness, which describes
children's strengths, challenges, and needs for supports when learning in the classroom, is a functional
outcome that differs from single summary measures of intelligence (IQ) and will be the outcome measure.
 A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metabonomics will be applied to the
collected fecal samples. Sophisticated machine learning strategies will be used to develop novel models of
preterm infant gut microbiome succession with time as a critical element. Serum cytokine analysis and
metabonomics will provide mechanistic insight into how the gut microbiome may be impacting
neurodevelopment. We have established complementary in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models, in which germ-free
mice are transfaunated with preterm infant microbiota. This state-of-the-art experimental model will allow
specific investigation of the impact of clinically relevant microbiota on brain development that is not possible in
human infants. The goal of this proposal is to discover intestinal microbiome patterns associated with school
readiness, identify the key time points that represent windows of opportunity for microbiome optimization, and
identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome impacts brain development and behavior. This new
knowledge will enhance our understanding of the gut-brain axis and lay the foundation for microbial based
therapeutics to improve infant neurodevelopmental trajectories."

 DAT18-06 In 2016, following a dramatic increase in opioid-related overdose deaths, the province of British
Columbia (BC), Canada declared a public health emergency. BC reported 1,510 illicit drug overdose deaths in 2018, a rate
of 31.0 per 100,000, placing it 10th among US states, equal to Rhode Island (31.0), behind West Virginia (57.8), Ohio (46.3)
and Pennsylvania (44.3) but ahead of New Jersey (30.0), Michigan (27.8) and Florida (25.1). While the four-fold increase
in overdose deaths observed since 2012 is largely attributable to the contamination of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids
in the illicit drug supply, many decedents had sought treatment in the past and experienced relapses.
 Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is among the most effective tools available to combat the epidemic. However, OAT
uptake and retention is sub-optimal in BC and internationally, compromised largely by social and structural factors but also
deviations from evidence-based standards of care and fragmented care, particularly for those with concurrent disorders.
Furthermore, a number of aspects of Canadian and US clinical guidelines for the management of opioid use disorder (OUD)
are based on limited and low-quality evidence. Even basic evidence on the comparative effectiveness of available treatment
options overall and for key populations in the fentanyl era is lacking.
 This proposal aims to apply cutting-edge methods for causal inference in emulating a series of ‘target trials’ in three
immediate aims: (1) to determine the comparative effectiveness of methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone for different
patient subgroups presenting for OAT; (2) to determine the impact of urine drug screening – a ubiquitous and non-evidence-
based element of OUD care – on OAT retention and mortality; and (3) to determine the complementary effects of OAT on
uptake and adherence to directing-acting antivirals for people with opioid use disorder (PWOUD) with concurrent Hepatitis
C Virus. The ‘target trial’ framework channels counterfactual theory in providing a flexible basis for comparing the effects
of treatment and clinical management strategies on either an intent-to-treat or per-protocol basis. We have identified a
number of additional questions related to the clinical management of PWOUD where guidelines are supported by weaker
empirical evidence and will endeavor to answer as many of these questions as possible, prioritizing analysis using a common
framework focused on methodological rigor and"
10766676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a public health crisis in America. Even among those in treatment, long-term
adherence to medication is low, and relapse is the norm. A core trigger for relapse is the experience of stress,
often involving psychosocial or interpersonal challenges. Preclinical models of OUD show that stress impacts
neural, endocrine, and behavioral functioning, increasing one’s vulnerability for initiating and sustaining the
addictive behavior. Here, we aim to translate these preclinical findings to human OUD patients on medication-
assisted treatment (primary drug: heroin; stabilized on the same medication dose for 1-6 months). We will employ
two broad approaches for examining psychosocial stress in patients, one utilizing chronic markers (i.e., trait-like
behavioral and imaging phenotypes) and one utilizing acute markers (i.e., state-like reactivity to a laboratory
induction paradigm which tests the adaptive capacity of the stress system). These approaches are fully
complementary (orthogonal), in that the chronic markers depend on between-person differences while the acute
markers depend on within-person fluctuations from each participant’s baseline. The chronic psychosocial stress
markers, to be acquired on Day 1 of the study, include: (1) social-cognitive functioning (emotion recognition task),
(2) fMRI activation during a decision-making task that involves exposure to threatening and drug-related images,
and (3) gray matter volume assessed with structural MRI and voxel-based morphometry. The acute psychosocial
stress markers will be acquired on Day 2 of the study (two weeks after Day 1), during which participants undergo
an experimental stress induction via personalized imagery. The acute stress markers include: experimentally-
induced changes in craving, salivary cortisol (marker of HPA functioning), and salivary alpha amylase (marker
of sympathetic activation). For each of these two approaches, we will test for hypothesized differences between
OUD participants and matched healthy controls (HC), and then within OUD we will test for hypothesized
correlations of the stress variables with scores from the Cumulative Adversity Interview (CAI), a well-validated
measure of lifetime cumulative psychosocial stress. Finally, OUD participants will be followed for 8 months to
track relapse status and drug use, which we hypothesize will be prospectively predicted by our multimodal stress
markers. With this design, we will address our study aims of uncovering whether there are abnormalities in the
neural, endocrine, and behavioral correlates of stress in OUD versus HC; whether such abnormalities in OUD
are exacerbated by cumulative adversity; and whether stress and its biological mechanisms predict OUD relapse
trajectories. Our study will advance basic knowledge of stress biology in OUD, a research area that to date has
been profoundly understudied compared with other addictions. Such knowledge may inform new therapeutic
targets for medication development and psychosocial intervention to help combat the opioid epidemic."

This application from the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy (CAGT) / Baylor College of Medicine (BCM)
describes a comprehensive training program in cellular and genetic therapies for both graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows. This rapidly expanding area of translational research remains deficient in comprehensive
training schemes for individuals who wish to address basic and clinical translational aspects using these
biological agents. A stimulating program of education and laboratory training from high quality and diverse
mentors should continue to attract promising candidates, including under-represented minorities, to this
emerging field and increase the likelihood that they will pursue careers as translational researchers. Translation
of basic research discoveries to clinical practice has become increasingly complex, and advances in basic
research can now only be efficiently implemented when teams of investigators collaborate to validate these novel
strategies in the clinic. This type of translational research training requires a dedicated team of mentors with
diverse but complementary skills. The proposed training exploits the outstanding biomedical curricula and
experienced faculty within BCM and CAGT. A cadre of 27 faculty members with research interests that include
vector design and targeting, stem cell biology, molecular and cellular genetics, immunotherapy, gene therapy
and stem cell transplantation will be available to mentor graduate students and both MD and PhD postdoctoral
fellows. Major strengths of the program are; (1) targeting of rigorous basic biomedical science and clinical
research training toward a translational goal; (2) established and multilevel integration with the proven scientific
excellence of cell biology and genetics research training programs at BCM; (3) involvement of mentors, including
program director and co-directors, who are diverse in gender and race and have a wealth of successful
experience in translational research and in training equally diverse young investigators (4) availability of
exceptional resources such as the GMP laboratories and experienced regulatory staff for training. Frequent
opportunities to present recent research findings at annual retreats sponsored by CAGT and academic
departments within BCM. augment the formal course work and laboratory training. During the 18.5 years of
funding, our approach has successfully trained 49 graduate students and 35 postdoctoral fellows in translational
cell and gene therapy research. 95% of trainees who have completed training remain in careers in science within
the field with 5% in private practice but engaged in clinical research. In the full 18.5 years that this T32 has been
funded, 51% of trainees have been male, 49% female and 20 of the 84 trainees (24%) have been from
underrepresented groups (13 Hispanic, 6 African American and 1 American Indian). All positions on this T32
have been filled at all times and we request an increase in support to enable us to meet the needs of trainees to
provide a strong foundation for translational research careers in this burgeoning area."

With the increase of healthcare-related Big Data, such as electronic health records (EHR), social media,
wearable devices, genomic data, and other digital records of information pertinent to individual and population
health, Big Data science has brought forth revolutionary advancements in many areas of health sciences,
including infectious disease research. However, the potential of Big Data in healthcare research has not been
fully realized due to challenges in data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. One such challenge is the
nationwide shortage of a workforce with the necessary knowledge, competencies, and skills of Big Data
analytics (BDA), especially a workforce with diverse backgrounds such as racial and ethnic minorities. A
promising approach to increase the diversity of the BDA workforce in infectious disease areas is to promote
BDA research training and education among students from diverse backgrounds in the early stages of their
academic training. In response to PAR-21-258, “NIAID Research Education Program Advancing the Careers of
a Diverse Research Workforce”, we propose this R25 emerging scholar (R25 e-Scholar) training program for
minority undergraduate students to foster their interests and competencies in BDA research in infectious
disease areas. As an important stage of the workforce development pipeline, the undergraduate training
program for racial and ethnic minority students will contribute to addressing the nationwide shortage of a
diverse data science workforce in NIAID-focused areas. The proposed R25 e-Scholar program will recruit 12
racial/ethnic minority undergraduate students annually from three public universities (University of South
Carolina, Clemson University, and the College of Charleston) and three Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) (South Carolina State University, Claflin University, and Benedict College) in South
Carolina and provide students with interdisciplinary mentoring, comprehensive curriculum-based training,
and hands-on research exposure and experience. The program will provide trainees with interdisciplinary
mentoring, including team and peer mentoring. Each student will be mentored by at least one faculty member
in Big Data or health science, and at least one racial/ethnic minority faculty member will serve as a career-
focused role model for the student. Through the mentoring process, students will gain comprehensive research
and professional development training, including responsible conduct of research, manuscript writing, and
presentations at local or national conferences. The program will offer comprehensive curriculum-based
training via a four-week intensive summer institute in areas of BDA, infectious disease, public health research,
and professional development. The program will engage trainees in hands-on Big Data research for exposure
and experience in Big Data processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation in the context of infectious
disease research. Trainees will participate in ongoing and future NIAID/NIH-funded or intramurally funded
Big Data research projects. Upon completion, these students will be inspired and equipped with confidence in
pursuing a postgraduate program or career in Big Data-focused infectious disease research. The training
program will foster a more diverse research environment at UofSC and across the state and encourage minority
undergraduate students to pursue Big Data research in the prevention, treatment, discovery, prediction, and
forecasting of HIV, COVID-19, and other infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases."

Many aspects of human health and disease are genetically complex; that is, they arise from multiple
interactions between genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. Understanding this complexity is the
basis of personalized medicine. Unfortunately, human genetic studies are still limited in a number of ways
including inadequate, retrospective medical records, formidable sample size requirements, insufficient
statistical power to study genetic interactions, and insufficient mechanistic information about many genes.
These obstacles are easily addressed using non-human, mammalian models, such as mice, that are designed
for fine scale dissection of genetic complexity, i.e. systems genetics. The biomedical research community has
made a significant investment in the genetically diverse inbred strains and genetic reference populations of
mice as tools for systems genetics research.
This proposal requests ongoing support for The Special Mouse Strain Resource (SMSR) at The Jackson
Laboratory. The SMSR serves as the biorepository for these unique sets of strains, ensuring permanent and
open access from high health status, quality-controlled, state-of-the-art facilities. The resource currently
consists of more than 300 strains, including the widely used BXD and Collaborative Cross strain panels, but
importantly, the strains available in the SMSR are changed and developed as dictated by the needs of
research community.
The major activities of the SMSR are to: i) archive, maintain, and distribute these strains to qualified biomedical
researchers, ii) provide complete, accurate and accessible information related to the mouse resources, iii)
confer with an external advisory board of thought leaders from the complex trait community to define current
and future resources, iv) provide leadership in best practices for research and reproducibility using SMSR
resources.
The SMSR also provides infrastructure, outreach and collaborative opportunities for the development of new
tools for complex trait analysis, as well as access to existing strains and populations for large-scale multicenter
projects; and conducts research to expand tools for genetic engineering of specialized mapping strains."

daytime consequences of OSA), David M. Rapoport, MD, (expert in pathophysiology of OSA and
its treatment), Andrew Varga, MD, PhD, (expert in sleep neurobiology, learning and memory) and
Trey Hedden, PhD (expert in neuroimaging). His training plan features a combination of carefully
designed coursework and practical training experiences in 1) experimental design and
methodology, 2) pathophysiology of OSA and sleepiness, and 3) neuroimaging. Research plan:
The proposed research builds on Dr. Parekh’s prior work and pilot feasibility studies funded by
the AASM and ISMMS. The aims of the proposed research are to understand the underlying
causes of inter-individual variability in lapses in vigilance in OSA patients and develop novel
quantitative sleep EEG biomarkers for sleepiness that capture this variability. Using a multimodal
approach involving sleep EEG and daytime fMRI, the proposed research utilizes the CPAP
withdrawal model to show that: 1) Prefrontal and thalamic activity during vigilance testing
mediates the relationship between sleep EEG and next-day lapses in vigilance. 2) OSA is
associated with decreased prefrontal and thalamic activity. 3) Changes in sleep EEG as a result
of OSA will predict the changes in prefrontal and thalamic activity. Successful completion of the
training and research plan will allow Dr. Parekh to contribute independently to research in
development of quantitative biomarkers for daytime sleepiness."

 Nucleic acids and their building blocks play central roles in all cellular events and, as such, have immense
impact on the emergence of diseases and, in turn, on human health. Studying such events is complicated by
the non-emissive nature of the natural nucleobases, which frequently deprives researchers from the use of
modern fluorescence-based techniques. Faithful minimally perturbing emissive nucleoside surrogates can thus
facilitate the monitoring of nucleoside, nucleotides and nucleic acids-based transformations at nucleoside/tide-
“resolution”, and advance basic research, diagnostic tools and drug discovery efforts.
 The goal of the proposed program is to design and synthesize new isomorphic emissive nucleoside and
nucleotide analogs and implement them as probes for monitoring nucleoside- and nucleotide-based
transformations as well as nucleic acids function, structure, dynamics and recognition. Specifically, major
contemporary challenges will be tackled in an attempt to bridge major gaps, among them: (a) Powerful
biophysical techniques, such as Fluorescence-Detected Circular Dichroism (FDCD), introduced nearly five
decades ago, remains practically unexplored; (b) Multiphoton, imaging and single molecule spectroscopy-
based experiments, using native or minimally perturbed oligonucleotides or nucleotide cofactors, are severely
underutilized; (c) Similarly, single molecule enzymology of nucleoside/tide processing enzymes has not
advanced; (d) Probes for real time exploration of fundamental processes such as peptidyl transferase, phase
separated membrane-less organelle formation and mRNA decay are lacking; (e) Nucleoside/tide-based
metabolic processes and nucleotide-based signaling events cannot be directly monitored; and (f) High
throughput screening for nucleosides and nucleosides processing enzymes cannot be performed in real-time
and in a high throughput manner without the use of faithful emissive surrogate substrates.
 Capitalizing on several useful families of emissive nucleoside surrogates developed in our laboratory, we
will further refine our “designer” emissive and isomorphic nucleosides/tides and apply them to advance
solutions to the challenges articulated above. We will pursue the advancement of new physical and
biochemical methods, as well as effective real-time screening and diagnostic tools. These efforts will expand
the community's arsenal of emissive functional probes, driving future strides into discovery and imaging
applications. These innovations, in turn, will further fundamental understanding of key biological processes
related to disease development and will have long-term impact on improving human health."

 This proposal presents a five-year research career development plan focused on improving diagnosis of
post-traumatic sepsis using microbial DNA sequencing in plasma. I am an Assistant Professor of Surgery at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with previous clinical and research experience in trauma surgery, patient-
centric predictors of sepsis, and lab-based genomic analyses of plasma in patients with sepsis. I have
assembled an outstanding mentorship team with expertise in infectious disease, cell-free DNA, genomic data
analysis, and bioinformatics. The proposed training will enhance my development across the disciplines of
translational research, laboratory and computational methods in genomics, and scientific writing. This will
enable me to transition to research independence as a surgeon-scientist dedicated to improving outcomes for
trauma patients with sepsis by developing better diagnostic tests based on microbial genomics.
 Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, estimated to cause one-fifth of all deaths worldwide. Approximately
25% of trauma patients develop sepsis during their hospital course and more than 20% of such patients die
during the same hospitalization. Sepsis, if not recognized and treated early, may evolve into septic shock and
multiple organ failure. Thus, the treatment of sepsis emphasizes timely initiation of antibiotics and source
control in surgery/trauma patients. However, the diagnosis of sepsis in patients with traumatic injury is
complicated because systemic inflammatory response to injury mimics sepsis. In the current paradigm,
confirmation of sepsis is based on clinical signs, laboratory and radiographic findings, and medical scores
which are usually obtained after sepsis onset. There are approximately 200 biomarkers of sepsis described in
literature but nearly all such biomarkers rely on measuring inflammatory response, which is confounded in
patients with trauma. Recent studies, including my preliminary work, have shown that metagenomic
sequencing of plasma DNA can rapidly identify pathogens in patients with clinical suspicion of sepsis but these
assays have not been investigated in trauma patients. To address this gap, I propose to develop and evaluate
a metagenomic sequencing-based assay for analysis of microbial DNA shed into the blood. My central
hypothesis is that quantitative analysis of microbial DNA levels in trauma patients can predict sepsis, rapidly
identify the causative organism of sepsis, and help decrease the duration of antimicrobial treatment. Using
prospectively collected plasma samples from trauma patients, I propose the following aims: 1) To determine if
an increase in circulating microbial DNA levels is predictive of sepsis in trauma patients, 2) To assess
concordance between causative organism identified using standard-of-care microbiology and detection of
pathogen-specific DNA in plasma, and 3) To evaluate circulating microbial DNA levels in plasma as a
biomarker for monitoring antimicrobial response."

About 25% of the 69,710 U.S. opioid overdose deaths in 2020 involved prescription opioids directly, and many
of the remaining overdose victims started opioid use with prescribed medication. Post-surgical opioid
prescribing comprises an increasing share of opioid prescribing, with considerable risks for misuse, new
persistent opioid use (NPOU), and opioid use disorder (OUD). There is a need to decrease these iatrogenic
risks without compromising postoperative analgesia. Buccal buprenorphine represents a potential alternative to
traditional post-surgical opioid prescribing with known lower respiratory depression risk. However, minimal data
exists regarding whether its administration yields: (1) decreased abuse potential or (2) acceptable analgesia for
acute pain. The Research Training Plan addresses these key gaps in understanding regarding the risk/benefit
ratio of postoperative buccal buprenorphine. Aim 1 involves pharmacodynamic and psychophysical
assessment of abuse potential and analgesia following buccal buprenorphine administration in a controlled
experimental setting. Aim 2 entails a preliminary study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a
randomized clinical trial of prescribing buccal buprenorphine for postoperative pain management. In each aim,
buccal buprenorphine will be compared with oxycodone, a commonly prescribed postoperative opioid. The
candidate has prior experience with small observational studies and large clinical database studies related to
post-surgical opioids and pain, with several first- and co-first-author publications in major journals. The Career
Development Plan will allow him to gain new proficiencies in the assessment of abuse potential and pain as
well as clinical trial design and execution, biostatistics, grantsmanship, and professional development. Mentor
Dr. Stephen Bruehl specializes in the experimental assessment of the subjective and analgesic response to
opioid administration. Co-mentor Dr. Sharon Walsh performed the seminal studies on buprenorphine
pharmacodynamics and is an expert on OUD. Co-mentors Dr. Chad Brummett and Dr. David Edwards are
authorities on postoperative opioid prescribing, and co-mentor Dr. Benjamin French is a specialist in clinical
trial design and biostatistics. Vanderbilt’s setting is highly conducive to research training and implementation.
This project will set the candidate on course for a career as an independent translational and clinical
investigator. The proposed studies promise to offer insights into whether buccal buprenorphine can serve as
an alternative postoperative analgesic with lower abuse potential. The subsequent planned definitive trial could
reshape post-surgical opioid prescribing patterns."
10896129,"This proposal describes a 5-year training program to develop an academic career focused on investigating the
role of mechanosensitive ion channels in glaucoma. My long-term goal is to discover new strategies for treating
glaucoma by understanding the mechanisms of mechanosensation in the eye. Although intraocular pressure
(IOP) is the most significant risk factor for glaucoma, the identify and function of mechanosensitive proteins in
the eye remain largely unknown. I will use human genetic analyses, in vitro molecular and electrophysiological
approaches, and in vivo mouse models of glaucoma to study the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in
mediating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in glaucoma. Preliminary results have identified human variants in
mechanosensitive ion channel genes associated with glaucoma risk. I hypothesize that mechanosensitive ion
channels in retinal cells sense IOP and mediate RGC death in glaucoma, and that human variants confer
differential risk in these functions. Aim 1 determines the contribution of mechanosensitive ion channels to
pressure-activated currents in retinal cells in vitro upon mechanical stimulation. Aim 2 investigates how human
variants of mechanosensitive ion channel genes alter channel function in a heterologous system. Aim 3 tests the
role of mechanosensitive channels in a mouse model of glaucoma. The proposed studies have the potential to
provide insight into how IOP leads to RGC death and identify novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma. With my
graduate training in sensory neuroscience and electrophysiology, I am well equipped to conduct this research.
My career development plan will allow me to 1) learn retinal physiology, 2) develop knowledge and technical
expertise in the field of mechanosensation, 3) acquire experience with mouse models of glaucoma and 4)
develop grantsmanship, leadership and managerial skills to lead an independent research team. I am supported
by a committed team of mentors who are dedicated to advancing my career as an independent clinician scientist.
I will work with retinal physiology expert Dr. Stephen Baccus, leaders in translational glaucoma research Dr.
Jeffrey Goldberg, Dr. Yang Hu and Dr. Yang Sun, mechanosensation and ion channel experts Dr. Ardem
Patapoutian, Dr. Miriam Goodman and Dr. Merritt Maduke, and human glaucoma genetics expert Dr. Janey
Wiggs. This training will take place within the collaborative vision and neuroscience community at Stanford, with
access to its extensive resources for research and career development. This research addresses a critical need
to understand the mechanisms of mechanosensation in glaucoma and prepares me for a career as an
independent NIH-funded investigator, with the ultimate goal of advancing these discoveries to the bedside to
develop better treatments for this common blinding disease."
10752671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescent girls with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk for depression due to risk factors
associated with female sex and ASD-related challenges. However, little empirical evidence is available on the
psychosocial mechanisms of depression onset and change for girls with ASD, leaving no effective intervention
to treat depression in this extremely vulnerable group. While social interaction and relationship challenges are
particularly pronounced during adolescence, sufficiently nuanced longitudinal data is needed to understand how
momentary and cumulative social and emotional experiences impact psychological well-being during this critical
time in order to inform treatment development.
The current proposal aims to investigate longitudinal trajectories and social mechanisms of depression in ASD
during adolescence with a focus on girls. Three complementary studies are proposed to achieve the research
objectives and provide necessary training to equip the candidate with advanced methodological and professional
skills to transition into an independent research position. During the mentored K99 phase, two secondary data
analyses will leverage existing data to generate initial evidence on depression and social experience in
adolescent girls with ASD to: (1) Map trajectories of depression symptoms in girls with ASD and typical
development (age 10 to 13) (Aim 1), using group-based longitudinal structural equation models (LSEM); (2)
Profile daily social experiences relevant to negative mood and depressive symptoms in girls with ASD (Aim 2),
using daily social experiences data collected with a cross-sectional sample of transition-age youths with ASD.
To examine social-emotional protective and risk factors of depression (Aim 3), during the R00 phase, an
accelerated longitudinal study with measurement bursts using ecological momentary sampling (EMA, study
protocol piloted in K99) will be conducted to collect four waves of original data on 120 adolescent girls (60 ASD
and 60 TD, age 14 to 16) over two years. Findings from the novel multi-method longitudinal study will directly
inform development of targeted intervention by identifying how momentary social experiences, emotions, and
coping strategies impact mood in the “moment” and in the long term, while considering the impact of individual-
level characteristics.
Through the carefully designed training activities and the institutional resources available at UCSF, the candidate
will receive focused training on developmental psychopathology and pubertal development in ASD, hands-on
clinical experiences in identifying and treating depression in girls with ASD, and methodological training in the
state-of-art design and analyses of EMA during the K99 phase. With the strong support from a team of leading
experts in their respective fields, the candidate will successfully establish her own line of research and become
an independent researcher with unique expertise."

The UCSC Diversity Action Plan at the University of California, Santa Cruz is known as the Research
Mentoring Internship Program (RMI), a research education program that improves equity and access to
careers in genomic science. Our specific aims are to recruit and retain a full cohort of 14 trainees per year who
meet NIH criteria in terms of underrepresentation; to inspire trainees to pursue genomics-focused careers by
fostering a community of scholars focused on genomics research and relevant ELSI investigations; to
supplement research training with a robust curriculum of professional development activities; and to ensure
that 80% or more of our graduating trainees take steps toward the next academic or career level. The RMI
program provides mentored research training and financial support for underrepresented minority (URM)
undergraduate students, students from low-income households, students with disabilities,
first-generation-to-college students, and students who have otherwise been minoritized by systemic
discrimination. Our mission is to prepare and advance our students toward successful careers in genomics
research or in fields that interrogate the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genomics. Students
supported by the RMI are assigned to a faculty research mentor with whom they train 10-15 hours per week
during the academic year, and up to 40 hours per week during summer. Mentor labs may be in any
department, provided that the research focuses on some aspect of genomic sciences. STEM research
environments may be wet labs or computational labs; ELSI projects are usually conducted under the aegis of a
faculty member from the Division of Social Sciences, and commonly approach a specific aspect of genomics in
one of the following areas: bioethics, policy, health care, social implications. The RMI provides financial support
in the form of quarterly subsistence payments. In addition to research training, the program offers academic
and professional development workshops, one-on-one coaching, career guidance, and near-peer mentoring.
The RMI exposes students to the culture and rigors of a research environment under the supervision of a
faculty mentor and with the support of an extended mentor network, thus enhancing preparation for and
success in graduate school and beyond. In addition to recruiting from the diverse student population of our own
campus (designated a Hispanic Serving Institution), we recruit prospective transfer students from regional
community colleges that have high percentages of students from BBIPOC (Brown, Black, Indigenous, and
People of Color), low-income, and underserved populations. To ensure successful persistence to degree
completion, we implement retention strategies based on best practices to create professional support and
programming and an expanded mentor network within a cutting-edge research environment that provides our
cohort with the knowledge, tools, and confidence needed to advance to meaningful careers in genomics."

The significance of sleep and circadian disorders on public health is broad because of its effects on physical and mental
health. The high prevalence of these disorders makes it critical that a robust pipeline exists for new investigators to
tackle the challenge of understanding the mechanisms involved, their impact on cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary
and neurodegenerative systems and develop and test interventions. Faculty at Icahn School of Medicine (ISMMS) and
New York University Grossman School of Medicine (NYU) from multiple departments (sleep medicine, pulmonary,
psychiatry, neuroscience, radiology, population health, cardiology, and biostatistics) have been involved in collaborative
basic and clinical research in sleep and circadian science for several decades. Our training program will build on the
foundation of successful mentored research and training programs (e.g. PRIDE institute at NYU) with experienced, well-
funded investigators who have demonstrated a strong commitment for career development. The areas of current
research include (but are not limited to) (i) basic biology of the circadian clock, (ii) translational research on the role of
sleep on memory, (iii) clinical patient oriented research evaluating physiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), its
treatment and evaluation of outcomes of OSA on cardiovascular and brain health (iv) developing simulation and web
based tools to assist teaching sleep physiology. State of the art physiological and imaging techniques (cardiac CT
imaging, PET/MR brain imaging, Alzheimer’s disease biofluid biomarkers) are employed, and include subjects across the
age spectrum (pediatric to elderly populations) and minority populations. We will leverage access to the existing training
infrastructure at the two institutions along with the experience of successful collaborations over the past 10 years
between multidisciplinary faculty at the two institutions and incorporate translational content to train post-doctoral
fellows. The aim of this 5-year program is to recruit and train a total of 6 postdoctoral candidates (physician scientists or
PhD graduates). Trainees will participate in a 2-3 year program during which time they are assigned to a mentoring
team, comprised of a primary, secondary and peer mentor. Mentors are nationally recognized investigators with
expertise in guiding mentees in developing their careers and in submitting successful grant applications. Trainees will
implement an Individual Development Plan, use a combination of existing conferences, didactic courses and technology-
assisted multi-institutional workshops to acquire professional, laboratory based skills and training in responsible conduct
of research. Trainees will have access to the broad training and research support resources of the two institutions
including those of the CTSI/CTSA. Measurable outcomes will include trainee publications, presentations, and grant
applications. Mentees’ achievements for 10 years post program will also be evaluated and include academic leadership
positions, career awards, federal and non- federal grants and engagement in mentoring activities. The Sleep Science T32
Program addresses the need for sleep and circadian researchers and facilitates their transition to independence."

The Clinical Pharmacology Training Program at Johns Hopkins is designed to train highly-qualified physicians,
pharmacists, and scientists to become independent clinical investigators applying the tools of clinical
pharmacology to advance drugs from the laboratory to the clinical treatment and prevention of disease in
people. This program addresses a critical shortage of well-trained clinical investigators who conduct hands-on
studies in humans, particularly in the area of clinical pharmacology. The program is centered in the Division of
Clinical Pharmacology, which is jointly within the Department of Medicine and the Department of
Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, in the School of Medicine. This venue is ideal for conducting research
that translates basic molecular discoveries into clinical trials. The training program takes three to four years to
complete and includes a core curriculum in clinical pharmacology (coursework, conferences, experiential
rotations, and research) as well as matriculation, typically, in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical
Investigation in the School of Public Health. In keeping with the collective expertise of the Division faculty,
research commonly focuses on anti-infective drugs, and has been expanded to include oncology, pediatrics,
pharmacoepidemiology, and obstetrics and gynecology, among other areas. Each trainee has a mentoring
team who oversees the fellow’s progress in the principles and analytical disciplines of clinical pharmacology,
clinical research, and professional development. Participating faculty are carefully chosen and committed to
playing a critical mentoring role for the fellows. Although there are no clinical care responsibilities in the
program apart from clinical research, fellows may complete a concurrent clinical subspecialty fellowship. The
program solicits and receives the regular advice of an External Advisory Board comprised of distinguished
translational- or clinician-scientists and outstanding clinical pharmacology educators from within and outside of
Johns Hopkins. After completion of this rigorous, comprehensive, and nurturing program, most graduates have
achieved board eligibility in Clinical Pharmacology, board eligibility in a medical sub-specialty clinical area
(MDs), and a PhD or MHS in Clinical Investigation. Historically, most of our graduates step directly into
academic research careers as Assistant Professors, at the interface of basic and clinical pharmacology."
10788278,"Over the past two decades, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, a component of MaineHealth, has built a
highly competitive research program encompassing basic, translational, clinical, and health services research
to support and enhance the healthcare needs of the state of Maine. Our focus on developing basic biomedical
research to support translational programs has been supported by the formation of Centers of Biomedical
Research Excellence (2000-present), and in 2017, a multi-institute Northern New England Clinical and
Translational Research Network to establish infrastructure required for extending clinical research efforts. We
have maintained a focus on medical training programs, with prominent academic affiliations with Tufts
University School of Medicine, with 40 of their medical students in a Maine Track program and 20 ongoing
residency and fellowship programs. Of note, recent expansions in graduate medical education include the
addition of a Rural Track in our Internal Medicine residency, and an enhanced focus on research as part of
residency and fellowships. These efforts have been bolstered by institutional investments to support medical
students and physicians in expanded options for research, and the alignment of research mentors with these
commitments. Research and clinical strengths at Maine Medical Center include topics of high relevance to the
mission of the NHLBI, including vessel wall biology, vascular development, myocardial injury, heart failure,
vascular progenitor cells, vascular inflammation, adipose/vascular interactions, endothelial dysfunction and
cardiovascular disease; and clinical research addressing cardiac arrest, cystic fibrosis, hemorrhagic shock,
vascular complications of trauma, and genetics/epidemiology of disease. This proposal requests the needed
support to fulfill the objective of the NHLBI to develop the biomedical research workforce focusing on a unique
population of medical students in Maine. This proposal requests funds to focus on providing rigorous, full-time
summer research training experiences for Maine Track medical students. While some of those students may
already have an interest in research, this new program will broaden our educational scope to include
translational biomedical research. Currently, all Maine Track students are required to complete a scholarly
project as part of their medical training, and we have an established infrastructure to support research
experiences in the summer after the first year of study. Our vision is to enhance this pipeline to increase our
community of rigorously trained physicians who are comfortable working across the basic-translational-clinical
research spectrum to promote public health. While this is a long-term and ambitious goal, it is even more
pressing in an environment such as the rural state of Maine, which does not have a portfolio of large academic
medical centers that attract a high number of medical students, residents or fellows interested in translational
research. This proposal requests funding for ten short-term summer experiences for medical students in the
Tufts Maine Track with experienced mentors committed to promotion of mentorship and training."
10772000,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Arachidonic acid, a long-chain ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), has been demonstrated to affect
carcinogenesis in animal and in vitro studies. The effect of arachidonic acid is believed to be largely due to
overproduction of the eicosanoid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The other class of PUFAs, ω-3, also bind to the
same enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism; however, the resulting set of eicosanoids are anti-
inflammatory. Thus, ω-3 PUFA metabolism could indirectly inhibit PGE2 production and reduce cancer risk.
Over the past few years, multiple genetic variants have been identified to be associated with PUFAs. The goal
of the proposed K99/R00 award is to elucidate the potential causal association between long-chain PUFAs and
colorectal tumor risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), an approach that may avoid potential pitfalls of
conventional observational epidemiologic research. Using fine-mapping, the proposed study will identify
additional variants in key loci (11q12.2 and 6p24.2) that are involved in the conversion from short- to long-
chain PUFAs to improve the PUFA genetic instruments. The proposed study will utilize individual-level data
from the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium; blood and tissue samples from the
Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study (TCPS); and genotype and phenotype information from Vanderbilt
University's de-identified electronic medical record DNA bio-repository (BioVU). Specifically, we propose the
following aims: (1) to conduct a MR study for the association between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal cancer
risk; (2) to conduct fine-mapping to identify additional variants in key PUFA metabolism loci to improve the
genetic instruments for MR; (3) to evaluate potential interactions of genetically predicted long-chain PUFAs
(using the improved genetic instrument) and use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)
with the risk of colorectal tumors; (4) to investigate associations between genetically predicted long-chain
PUFAs and selected tumor biomarkers; and (5) to conduct a mediation analysis to determine whether PGE2 is
a mediator on the causal pathway between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative
study will be the first to develop an instrumental variable using a polygenic risk score in order to identify
potential causal association between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal cancer tumor risk, and will be cost-
efficient. The proposed study will help elucidate associations between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal
tumors, which could lead to potential risk reduction strategies. Lastly, the proposed career development award
will equip the candidate with the additional didactic and research training necessary for building an
independent research program in the areas of nutrition, genetics and molecular epidemiology, and cancer. "
10774205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous and the most prominant Ser/Thr phosphatase that regulates the
phosphorylation status of a large number of cellular proteins involved in diverse biological pathways.
Derulagulation of PP2A is associated with many human cancers, Alzheimer's Disease and susceptibility to
pathogens. The PP2A core enzyme is a heterodimer of highly conserved scaffold and catalytic subunits, which
forms the heterotrimeric holoenzyme by binding a variable and highly diverse regulatory subunit that determines
substrate selectivity. Built on recent advance on structural choreography of tight control of PP2A holoenzyme
biogenesis, in particular, the conformational switches of PP2Ac required for its latency and activation, we further
made a striking observation on recycling of PP2Ac from holoenzymes. We also observed a novel function of
PME-1 (PP2A-specific methylesterase 1) in demethylation of and interaction with PP2A holoenzymes; PME-1
was previously thought to specifically act on the core enzyme. The research proposed here will extend our
preliminary electron microscopic analyses of PP2A complexes, and use structural, biochemical, biophysical and
cell biological approaches to elucidate mechanisms that control novel function and mechanism of PME-1 in
holoenzyme regulation (Specific Aim 1), recycling of PP2Ac from PP2A holoenzymes (Specific Aim 2), and novel
insights into PP2A holoenzyme biogenesis and recycling and the multi-faceted roles of PME-1 in cellular
signaling. These studies will establish a novel regulation loop of PP2A holoenzyme biogenesis and recycling for
precise and dynamic control of PP2A holoenzymes in diverse cellular and physiological processes, and provides
a novel framework for understanding the mechanisms that regulate PP2A functions in normal and transformed
human cells."
10839761,"The recent clinical success of inhibitors against immune checkpoint proteins (e.g. CTLA-4, PD-L1), which are
thought to stimulate T cell responses against tumors, has revolutionized cancer therapy. Yet even among
patients with high tumor mutational burden, only approximately 20-30% of patients achieve deep response, and
discerning responders from non-responders is challenging with conventional imaging. On this basis, there is an
urgent unmet need to develop biomarkers that distinguish responsive and treatment resistant patients, as well
as identify patients at risk for undesired immune related adverse events. We hypothesized that an imaging
biomarker capable of selectively measuring the biology that T cells use to impart cytotoxicity might address
these unmet needs. Since antitumor T cell cytotoxicity is conferred primarily by the pro-apoptotic serine protease
granzyme B, we have developed a peptide-based chemosensor we term “restricted interaction peptide” that
enables spatiotemporal measurements of granzyme B proteolytic activity as the enzyme traverses the
immunological synapse between T cell and target cell. Upon proteolytic cleavage of the full length, pro-form of
the restricted interaction peptide (termed GB1) by granzyme B, a radiolabeled antimicrobial peptide is liberated
and undergoes a spontaneous conformational shift that results in stable (and non-toxic) membrane association.
We have shown that radiolabeled GB1 detects T cell activation in tumors and normal tissues elicited by systemic
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Following on these encouraging preclinical data, we have now assembled a
multidisciplinary team to conduct translational studies to evaluate the utility of granzyme B biochemistry as a
biomarker. Over three specific aims, we will (1) perform IND enabling studies for 64Cu-GB1, (2) conduct a phase
0 first in human study to determine tracer safety, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry, and (3) execute a phase I
study to determine the accuracy for detection of urothelial and renal cancers undergoing a productive immune
response due to treatment with standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors. If successful, this project will
establish a new paradigm for the measurement of T cell cytotoxicity in vivo that could have implications for the
clinical management of other problematic human disorders like bacterial or viral (HIV, SARS-CoV) infections.
Moreover, the imaging approach is entirely new, and favorable data emerging from this project could motivate
further studies to develop restricted interaction peptides to measure the enzymology of other disease associated
proteases in vivo with PET."
10791868,"Pregnancy loss is a common and devastating event for women and families, and estimates suggest that more than half of all embryos are lost between fertilization and birth. A significant cause of early pregnancy loss is defective implantation, which can also set the stage for serious and potentially fatal pregnancy complications (e.g. intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia). Despite recent advances in reproductive medicine, most pregnancy loss is unexplained. Rates of pregnancy loss among U.S. women are on the rise. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand of cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the establishment of pregnancy, which is critical to the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve rates of implantation and pregnancy outcomes. Immune system dysregulation is thought to significantly contribute to the etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss. Glucocorticoids are master regulators of the immune system, and these transcriptional regulators represent a previously unexplored pathway contributing to the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss. We discovered that the loss of endogenous glucocorticoid signaling in the uterus causes mice to lose approximately half of all pregnancies in the first five days, similar to rates of early pregnancy loss in humans. We aim to expand our understanding of the process of implantation and the pathophysiology of early pregnancy loss by testing the central hypothesis that uterine glucocorticoid signaling is essential for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy by directly regulating the local immune cell environment. This hypothesis is supported by the compelling preliminary data which demonstrates that (1) the regulation of genes essential to the immune response is disrupted in the uterus of uterine glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout mice, (2) the number of uterine macrophages, neutrophils, and regulatory T-cells are altered in the uterine GR knockout mice compared to controls, (3) GR knockdown in primary human endometrial cells inhibits the differentiation of stromal cells into decidual cells, and (4) GR polymorphisms are associated with both recurrent miscarriage and disorders of the immune system. We have proposed three discrete aims to build on these findings. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine how glucocorticoid signaling in the uterus governs immune cell trafficking. In Specific Aim 2, we will discover the GR-regulated decidualization pathways that are conserved in mouse and human endometrium. In Specific Aim 3, we will identify how a common GR polymorphism, which confers glucocorticoid resistance, alters endometrial cell function. The proposed work is innovative because our studies represent the first investigation into the local actions of glucocorticoids during the establishment of pregnancy and cross-talk between the uterus and maternal immune system. By defining these processes, our studies will generate new data to advance our understanding of early pregnancy loss and have the potential to substantially contribute toward the development of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets to improve pregnancy outcomes."
10791747,"ABSTRACT
The prevalence of and mortality from cirrhosis have increased dramatically over the past twenty years. Atrial
fibrillation (NVAF) disproportionately affects 15% of patients with cirrhosis and leads to substantial morbidity and
mortality, including 5-fold higher rates of stroke. In the general population with NVAF, the risk-benefit balance
typically favors initiation of oral anticoagulants (OAC). In contrast, over 50% of patients with cirrhosis and NVAF
are not anticoagulated despite their markedly increased risk of stroke, due to concerns about bleeding, poor
anticoagulation quality and falls. These concerns also complicate selection of an optimal OAC regimen, which
involves choosing between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC: apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran
and edoxaban). While DOACs have potential benefits over warfarin in patients with cirrhosis, they have variable
hepatic metabolism (between 20%-75%) and they are largely untested in cirrhosis, because such patients were
excluded from all prior DOAC randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for NVAF. Moreover, RCTs are unlikely to
recruit and retain vulnerable patients with advanced, decompensated cirrhosis or cognitive impairments in a
manner representative of routine care. Thus, for patients with cirrhosis and NVAF – who are at higher risk of
both bleeding and thrombosis – there is a pressing need for robust data regarding the optimal OAC strategy.
This proposal seeks to define the comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin and DOACs in a population-
based cohort of over 250,000 U.S. adults with established cirrhosis and NVAF diagnosed between 2011-2019
(including over 100,000 new OAC initiators), from 4 healthcare databases (Medicare, Medicaid, Truven
MarketScan and Optum Clinformatics). Within this cohort, we propose: (Aim 1) To define the effectiveness and
safety of use vs. non-use of OACs (including warfarin and specific DOACs); (Aim 2) To define the comparative
effectiveness and safety of initiating (2a) warfarin vs. DOACs; and (2b) specific DOACs (i.e. head-to-head
comparisons of, apixaban vs. rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran vs. edoxaban); and (Aim 3) To identify key subgroups
for whom OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous – including patients with advanced or decompensated
cirrhosis, high fall risk or poor predicted anticoagulation quality. To minimize confounding and optimize study
validity, we will use innovative methods developed by our team, including: (i) high-dimensional propensity scores;
(ii) our novel, validated algorithms for phenotyping cirrhosis severity, fall risk and anticoagulation quality; and (iii)
linkage of a subset of our cohort with rich clinical information and laboratory data from electronic health records
(EHR), for external adjustment and propensity score calibration. Completing these studies will provide the
necessary evidence base for providers to optimize OAC selection and stroke prevention in vulnerable patients
with cirrhosis and NVAF, yielding an immediate and direct public health benefit. This work will also produce
a readily generalizable infrastructure for robustly detecting drug effects in patients with chronic liver disease."
10766739,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global spread of the arthropod borne flaviviruses dengue (DENV1-4) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are major
global public health challenges. World health organizations are calling for scientific communities to respond to
this emerging threat with vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. However, existing gaps in fundamental
knowledge about DENV and ZIKV immunity, specifically how type-specific immunity to each serotype develops
and is sustained, makes rational vaccine development particularly difficult. The dominant immunity model comes
from human challenge studies on DENV (1910’s-1940’s) and posits that first infection induces neutralizing
antibodies that provide life-long sterilizing immunity to repeat infections by the same (homotypic) serotype virus,
and this model has been extended to ZIKV without rigorous evaluation. However, recent studies from DENV
endemic regions provide evidence of homotypic re-infection and natural immune boosting over time and our
preliminary data from a non-endemic, Portland, Oregon resident DENV and ZIKV immune cohort show type-
specific Abs decay – lose both potency and breadth - over time, calling into question sterilizing immunity and
leading us to hypothesize that natural flavivirus (ZIKV and DENV) protective immunity is context dependent: in
endemic transmission settings intermittent asymptomatic boosting maintains potency and breadth of virus
specific immunity and in non-endemic or very low transmission settings potency and breadth of flavivirus
immunity significantly wanes. To test this hypothesis, we propose to prospectively characterize and compare
DENV and ZIKV immunity in a regularly re-exposed endemic cohort in Ponce, Puerto Rico with immunity in an
un-boosted, non-endemic cohort of DENV immunes in Portland. This is a controversial and novel hypothesis
that will call for substantial supporting evidence, hence we will compare and contrast three highly relevant and
related markers of boosting between the two cohorts: The potency and breadth of neutralizing serum DENV and
ZIKV specific Abs (Aim 1), the frequency of and potency of DENV and ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1)
specific antibodies (Aim 2), and the frequency and specificity of DENV and ZIKV specific memory B-cells (MBCs)
(Aim 3). We expect to find that Abs and MBCs decline at a significantly greater rate in individuals from the non-
endemic setting compared to the endemic setting supporting the hypothesis that boosting plays a critical role in
natural immunity for these viruses, with implications for future vaccine development. Because MBCs are
functionally linked to Abs, quantifying virus specific MBCs tests a mechanistic connection between repeat
infection and Ab titer boosting. Our proposed work will comprehensively assess the role transmission context
plays in flavivirus immunity using two highly relevant and mechanistically linked determinants (Ab and MBC).
Irrespective of specific results, the knowledge obtained from the proposed work will be essential to DENV vaccine
development and mechanistic understanding of flavivirus Ab mediated immunity."
10765660,"Project Summary: Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld
portable eddy current damping imaging device
Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, costing
the U.S. health system more than $71 billion per year in lost productivity and medical expenses. Existing
paradigms for stroke/TBI diagnosis require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to
classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic variants prior to intervention, as treatment for these conditions varies
widely. Delays in diagnosis and issues related to transport of unstable patients associated with diagnostic
imaging increase the likelihood of neurological injury and death. Translational medical devices that accelerate
time-to-treatment in the field or hospital setting may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in stroke/TBI patients
on a global level. Our team has developed a portable, rapid and noninvasive imaging and detection device based
on eddy current damping (ECD) sensors that can detect brain hemorrhages associated with stroke and TBI, and
have demonstrated feasibility in a benchtop, human cadaver and clinical patient setting. This device can
potentially diagnose and classify hemorrhagic stroke/TBI subtypes with accurate spatial localization in minutes,
rather than hours, thereby guiding early responders and medical providers in making time-sensitive medical
decisions for clinical intervention, such as administration of tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke. Our
overall goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel stroke detection device in rapidly triaging stroke/TBI
patients and achieving a level of diagnostic accuracy capable of guiding clinical intervention. We hypothesize
that: 1) Regional conductivity changes in brain tissue can be imaged and detected using the portable ECD
sensor; 2) Hemorrhagic stroke and TBI-related hemorrhages will increase regional conductivity, whereas
ischemic stroke will decrease dependent brain conductivity in affected ischemic regions; and 3) Portable stroke
imaging may reduce time-to-treatment and diagnosis associated with stroke/TBI. To test these hypotheses, we
aim to: 1) Perform benchtop laboratory experiments to further elucidate how direction and magnitude of
measured conductivity changes can differentiate stroke subtype and location, 2) Use validated human cadaver
stroke simulation models to optimize ECD tri-coil array sensor detection of hemorrhage depth, volume, and
location, 3) Utilize machine learning algorithms to quickly classify brain lesions with high accuracy, and 4)
Implement early clinical stroke/TBI ECD sensor device testing to gauge effectiveness in live human patients,
compared to CT/MR imaging. Development of methods for rapid bedside stroke/TBI diagnosis will provide
practitioners with knowledge required to rapidly administer life-saving treatments, thereby improving patient
quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this will help to reduce time-to-treatment and guide triage

Unnecessary risk by random insertional mutagenesis and uncontrolled expression of inserted transgenes
represent critical issues with current non-targeted gene therapy approaches. Homology directed repair (HDR)
can target inserts but is inefficient, especially in non-dividing cells or if the donor DNA is large. Currently, a
system for efficiently inserting a therapeutic gene to a known sequence is critically needed. To address these
challenges, the applicants have developed a novel system for DNA integration by evolving integrase enzymes
to insert DNA of flexible size at a desired sequence in the human genome. The long-term goal is to develop
clinical therapies that use insertional vectors to treat genetic disease. The central hypothesis is that directed
evolution will produce an integrase capable of targeting a single attP site in the genome without off-target
insertion. To demonstrate translational applicability, the evolved integrase will be assayed for delivery of the
therapeutic Factor IX gene to the liver of hemophilic mice. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of
preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratories clearly demonstrating that their directed evolution
approach successfully improves integrase specificity. The rationale is that, development of this new tool will allow
researchers and clinicians to deliver therapeutic transgenes to a single, known sequence. This would overcome
risks of insertional mutagenesis and facilitate predictable transgene expression. In Aim 1, directed evolution will
be used to repeatedly evolve and select for variants with improved targeting specificity in order to generate
integrases active on a single sequence in the genome. In Aim 2, evolved integrases will be screened for activity
in human cell lines and a genome-wide analysis of possible off-targets will be performed. In Aim 3, the site-
specific integrase will be delivered to the liver of a mouse model of Hemophilia B. The therapeutic potential of
treating Hemophilia B with this technology will be assessed. The project is highly innovative because it uses an
advanced continuous directed evolution system that is orders of magnitude faster than traditional approaches
and has never been applied to improving integrase vectors. These sequence targeting vectors will be combined
with a non-invasive, tissue-specific delivery approach for the first time. The proposed research is significant
because it develops a tool capable of safely and efficiently directing therapeutic genes to a desired sequence in
the genome without negative off-target consequences. Patients suffering from genetic diseases frequently have
a variety of distinct mutations. This technology could be used to insert a corrected gene copy to treat disease,
irrespective of an individual's mutation. Complex disorders could be treated by delivering multiple genes or whole
biosynthetic pathways. In order to demonstrate a therapeutic application, Factor IX will be delivered to mice to
model a treatment for Hemophilia B. Significantly, because the size and sequence of the inserted DNA is flexible,
this platform technology is adaptable to preclinical research applications as well as potential treatments of any
disease requiring gene replacement."

 Epilepsy is one of the world’s most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not
changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so
one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the
disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher
resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency
Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under
clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) they are difficult to
find; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use
the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of
these obstacles. In the past funding period, we developed and validated an HFO detection algorithm that
overcomes the first obstacle, and allowed us acquire a massive database of HFOs that have opened new
avenues of research. In this proposal, we will leverage that algorithm to move HFOs towards clinical
translation. In the first Aim, we apply advanced functional connectivity techniques to quantify the network
properties of HFOs. Our data, which comprise HFOs from the entire hospitalization and fully curated
metadata, are ideal for robust analyses of this new area of HFO research. The second Aim addresses a
longstanding, and still unsolved problem in HFO research: how to discern when HFOs are due to epileptic
processes versus normal physiology? Our past funding period identified some potential methods to identify
pathological HFOs, but also crucial caveats that must be addressed prior to clinical implementation. This Aim
will combine multiple classification methods with state-of-the-art machine learning tools to distinguish
epileptic from normal HFOs. It will also conduct a large human expert classification of HFOs using clinical
EEG software, to start involving epilepsy clinicians in the direct evaluation of HFOs. The third Aim will further
develop the translational potential of HFOs, incorporating our unique longitudinal clinical data to characterize
the effects of medications, sleep, and other time-varying effects on HFO rates. It will then incorporate these
and all prior HFO data into a rigorous latent class model to predict how likely each channel is to be epileptic.
These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures,
allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies using
HFOs to guide prospective clinical decisions."

Saliva is essential for oral and global health. The indispensable oral fluid - produced by salivary glands - facilitates
chewing, swallowing, speaking, and gustation. Loss of saliva (i.e. dry mouth) represents a significant health
burden, and can be caused by cancer treatments, medications (e.g. anti-hypertensives), or autoimmune
destruction of the gland. Patients report significant suffering when they lose saliva because they begin to
experience life-long morbidities, such as alterations in taste, loss of appetite, mucosal irritation and oral pain. To
date, additional treatments and therapies are needed to stimulate saliva production to alleviate dry mouth.
The autonomic nervous system is the primary controller of saliva production and release. However, the brain
and other neuronal components provide input to stimulate or inhibit these salivary autonomic neurons. Here, we
investigate a novel aspect of the nervous system that may influence salivary gland function: the trigeminal
somatosensory neurons that innervate the glands. We hypothesize that somatosensory neurons innervating the
gland respond to local stressors and influence saliva production. The overall objective of this application is to
use both small and large animal models to a) examine the glandular cell targets of the trigeminal sensory
innervation, b) define the molecular identity of gland-innervating sensory neurons, c) characterize the stimuli that
activate sensory neurons, and d) determine how sensory innervation influences saliva production. We will use
an array of powerful, cutting-edge approaches to develop a comprehensive view of these enigmatic neurons
across mammalian species.
Our studies will reveal new information on the topographical and molecular mapping of sensory innervation in
the gland, and the functional involvement of sensory neurons in saliva production. Ultimately, new therapeutic
strategies will develop from this work that target increasing saliva production in patients suffering from dry mouth."

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) including idiopathic and other forms of pulmonary fibrosis represent a major
and growing medical burden. While FDA-approved therapeutics limit progression of fibrotic ILDs, they do not
fundamentally alter the course of these diseases. A central element of fibrosis progression in ILDs is the
persistent activation of fibroblasts to a fibrogenic state; whereas transient fibroblast activation promotes wound
healing, aberrant and prolonged fibroblast activation promotes fibrotic ECM deposition and hinders restoration
of cellular homeostasis in epithelial and hematopoietic compartments. Hence, understanding how fibroblasts
become activated and then locked in fibrogenic states is central to the development more effective therapies
for fibrotic ILDs. Based on extensive preliminary data demonstrating a key role for the transcription factor
Runx1 in fibroblast activation and fibrogenic memory in mouse and human fibrotic lung tissue, we will test the
central hypothesis that fibroblasts gain and maintain a memory of fibrogenic activation that primes them for
amplified activation upon repeated injury, and that Runx1 plays a central role in this activation and fibrogenic
memory. We propose to test this hypothesis in three specific aims. In the first aim we will use a mouse model
to identify the location, abundance and specific transcriptional targets of Runx1 engagement during fibrosis
initiation, resolution and persistence. In the second aim we will test whether conditional deletion of Runx1
attenuates fibrosis and fibroblast memory, diminishes persistent fibrosis in a repeated bleomycin injury model,
and restores homeostatic states in mesenchymal and other lung compartments. In the final aim we will analyze
human lung tissue and fresh sorted fibroblasts to delineate Runx1 engagement, targets and functional effects
relevant to human disease. In both mouse and human tissue, we will seek to identify the role of mechanical
and biochemical signals in conferring fibrogenic memory and Runx1 activation and will test established and
investigational therapeutics for their capacity to erase fibrogenic memory. Together these studies will test the
function and regulation of Runx1 in fibrogenic cell activation and memory in mouse models and human tissue,
potentially identifying a novel targetable mechanism underlying fibrotic ILD progression."

 Dendritic cells (DC) have a major influence on tumor immunity. DC depletion abrogates tumor immunity and
response to PD1 (αPD1) immunotherapy in many preclinical tumor models and DC infiltration in human tumors
is a positive correlate of clinical outcome. Unfortunately, we still lack effective strategies for harnessing DC to
stimulate tumor immunity and this is in large part because we do not fully understand the control of tumor DCs.
 To address this shortcoming, we performed scRNA-seq on human and mouse lung tumor lesions. Notably,
we identified a distinct and nearly identical population of DC in both human and mouse lung tumors which
upregulated genes associated with both DC maturation such as CD40 & IL12, and immunoregulation, including
PD-L1 & CD200. This led us to annotate the cluster “mature DC enriched in immuno-regulatory molecules”
(mregDC)(Maier et al. Nature 2020). Strikingly, mregDC were the DC carrying tumor antigen (Ag); meaning these
DC are responsible for tumor Ag presentation. We hypothesize the immunostimulatory potential of tumor DC is
dampened by genes upregulated in the mreg module and this thwarts induction of tumor immunity and response
to αPD1. We propose that by targeting specific mreg genes we can decouple regulatory & stimulatory programs
and enhance DC activation of tumor-reactive T cells and promote tumor immunity and αPD1 response. In support
of our hypothesis, blocking signaling of IL4R, one of the upregulated genes in the mreg module, enhanced DC
activation, expanded tumor-infiltrating T cells, and reduced tumor burden in a mouse model of NSCLC.
Additionally, inhibition of Birc2/3, also upregulated in mregDC, led to substantially enhanced DC activation.
 To test our hypotheses and reach our objective, we will: (1) Determine the role of IL4R on induction of the
mregDC state and tumor immunity. We will knockout IL4R in mouse & human DC and determine how this
impacts mreg induction, Ag presentation, & tumor immunity. We will also combine anti-IL4R & anti-PD1 to assess
synergy in controlling tumor growth in a preclinical model. (2) Evaluate Birc2/3 inhibition on the physiology,
molecular state and immunostimulatory activity of intratumoral DC. We will test the hypothesis that
pharmacological inhibition of Birc2/3 will enhance DC production of IL-12, as well co-stimulatory molecules, while
facilitating cancer cell death and tumor Ag uptake, and result in robust tumor immunity. (3) Deconvolute the
intrinsic regulators of DC phenotype and the mreg gene module. We will utilize a first-of-its-kind CRISPR
genomics platform we developed to KO each of the 37 transcriptional related factor (TrF) genes upregulated by
mregDC and determine how each impacts tumor DC activation and molecular state. The outcome of this project
will provide a major advance in our understanding of intratumoral DC biology by determining the role of specific
genes and pathways in dampening tumor DC functions, establish in preclinical models the therapeutic potential
of compounds targeting two different pathways operating in mregDC, and identify additional molecules that could
be targeted to enhance DC activity."

centered on infections and inflammation, especially on transmission of pathogens, the pathogenesis of
neuroinflammation, regulation of host inflammatory responses at the sites of pathogen entry (airway, skin, and
mucosa), regulation of leukocyte migration in the blood, liver brain and other organs, and vaccine/drug
development for the control of pathogens and tissue damage. Trainees (9 per year, 45 in total) will devote full-
time participation during a ten-week research period and will gain an in-depth knowledge of biological
concepts, modern research areas and tools. They will have the opportunity to choose basic, clinical,
translational, or behavior research projects. The program will match talented medical students with NIH-funded
faculty mentors, coupling the daily experience with an ongoing series of courses, summer research seminars,
research-in-progress discussions, oral presentations, and monitoring from faculty members. The specific
objectives are 1) to expose medical students early in their career to the excitement and technology of medical
research and to foster their investigative and analytical skills; 2) to encourage medical students to pursue a
career in basic and clinical research in the areas of infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders; and 3) to
provide valuable experience and references for students who wish to seek additional research training and
funding in the future. An adequate tracking system is in place for monitoring the career development of
trainees and the continued success of this training program. Our ultimate goal is to promote the professional
development for our medical students, enhancing their skills in research, oral/written presentations and
leaderships."
10768611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been classified as a direct carcinogen by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer because of its ability to cause Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and two rare types of
B-cell lymphoma. KS frequently occurs among iatrogenic or HIV/AIDS-induced immunosuppressed individuals.
To date, there is no licensed KSHV vaccine that can prevent primary infection and subsequent malignancies.
Our objective in this application is to optimize the inclusion of key KSHV glycoproteins (gps), which are
involved in epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast and B-cell entry, into multivalent subunit vaccine candidates that
can stimulate neutralizing antibody (nAb) immune responses to prevent or limit KSHV infection and KSHV+
cancers in vivo. This application builds on my recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV
entry mechanisms and vaccine development. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH is
essential for viral infection of epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and other
have also shown that both monoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins K8.1, gB, and gH/gL can
neutralize KSHV infection of diverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we have
generated quadrivalent virus-like particles (KSHV-LPs) incorporating the four glycoproteins critical for viral
entry (K8.1, gB and gH/gL). In this application we will use wild-type and humanized mice and common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) models to test the hypothesis that purified KSHV-LPs delivered directly or
through immunization with a modified vaccinia Ankara vector (MVA-KSHV-LPs) will elicit robust protective nAb
responses to KSHV infection and its associated malignancies. The premise of our proposal is built on strong
evidence that 1) infection with KSHV does not occur during early childhood, as is typical for other
herpesviruses, opening a window of opportunity for vaccination and 2) Abs against the KSHV glycoproteins
K8.1, gB, and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection. Furthermore, the permissiveness of humanized mice and
marmosets to KSHV infection offers an ideal platform to test candidate vaccines. Thus, a polyvalent vaccine
that induces prophylactic neutralizing Abs responses will not only be an invaluable candidate vaccine in
preventing KSHV infection, but also of utmost importance in preventing KSHV-associated diseases. We will
provide evidence for the safety of our candidate KSHV vaccine based on three pre-clinical animal models as
prerequisite data for an IND application for a phase I clinical trial. In the long term, the success of our approach
will introduce a new vaccine to the market with a potential for reducing global incidence of KSHV+
malignancies (>44,000 cases/year), and the possibility of limiting KSHV infection and associated malignancies
in developing countries or eradicating them from developed countries where KSHV seroprevalence is <10%."
10767274,"The focus of this renewal application is to build upon the findings from the Influence of Social Networks on
Infant Care and Disparities in Postneonatal Infant Mortality (SONIC) study by conducting a 4-armed
randomized controlled trial (RCT) using online social networks (OSNs) to promote safe infant care practices
and reduce Black/White (B/W) disparities in adherence to these practices. In SONIC, we conducted social
network analysis on 402 new and experienced mothers of young infants. We learned that there are 2 social
network (i.e., family, friends, and peers) types: exclusive (kin-based) and expansive (not kin-based); that
network social norms (group rules defining appropriate behaviors, values, and attitudes) are highly predictive of
infant sleep practices (sleep position, bedsharing, soft bedding use); that mothers are more likely to change
from safe to unsafe practices if their network members espouse unsafe practices; and that Black mothers are
more likely to have exclusive networks, which are more likely to have unsafe practices as the norm. Safe sleep
practices are associated with lower rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and unintentional injury-
related deaths (e.g. accidental suffocation) associated with the sleep environment. These sleep-related deaths
(SRDs) remain the leading cause of postneonatal death in the US, with ~3600 deaths/year; Black infants die at
more than double national rates. Thus, differences in social networks and norms contribute to the Black/White
(B/W) disparity seen in safe sleep practices, which in turn contribute to the B/W disparity in postneonatal infant
deaths; the influence of social networks and norms, if contrary to recommended infant care practices, is a
major barrier to acceptance of these practices. OSNs have become a powerful tool for establishing social
norms and influencing behavior, and data suggest that this is equally or more so for Blacks. Thus, our
proposed SUPERSONIC (Support via Online Social Networks to promote Safe Infant Care practices Toward
Reducing Racial Disparities in Infant Mortality) study is the natural next step after SONIC. We plan to test,
through a 4-armed pragmatic RCT, an intervention strategy that uses OSNs (private Facebook groups) to
change social norms among WIC recipient mothers, who have a disproportionate burden of SRDs and high
proportion of Blacks. Mothers in each study arm will participate in an OSN and receive one of 4 messaging
interventions: 1) safe sleep alone, 2) breastfeeding alone, 3) both safe sleep and breastfeeding, and 4) routine
health messages (attention-matched control). Beginning prenatally, we will disseminate via OSNs videos and
messages that address common myths and misconceptions to ultimately impact attitudes and social norms
regarding infant sleep practices and breastfeeding. If utilization of OSNs is effective in changing network norms
and maternal attitudes, and improving adherence, this approach is easily scalable. Moreover, it could be
replicated and potentially readily applied to other health care messages, including vaccine acceptance and
nutrition/obesity."
10757058,"Pregnancy imposes remarkable changes to the breast; 1- during pregnancy, impressive cellular proliferation
and differentiation of the ductal tree is observed, 2- during lactation, the ultimate function of breast and 3- during
post-lactation involution that is associated with tissue remodeling and inflammation. Interestingly both the
proliferation during pregnancy and the inflammation during involution engage signaling pathways associated with
cancer and indeed, the risk of breast cancer increases following pregnancy. However, extended lactation
reduces that risk but the molecular mechanism of the protective effect of breastfeeding remains unknown. Based
on our preliminary data, we postulate that the ovarian-derived hormone stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is the potential
mediator of the protective effect of breastfeeding. STC 1 is a secreted hormone produced mainly by the ovaries
during lactation. It has been found to act as an inhibitor of the protease PAPP-A, Pregnancy-Associated Plasma
Protein A. PAPP-A is a secreted protease that promotes proliferation through IGF signaling by degrading IGFBP-
5 during involution, promotes immune evasion and we reported takes advantage of the microenvironment of
involution to promote metastasis. PAPP-A is frequently overexpressed in the breast cancers and we have
generated the first mouse model of PAPP-A driven mammary tumors. Importantly for this application, we found
that long lactation prevents the formation of PAPP-A-driven tumors. Our hypothesis is that ovarian-derived STC1
produced during lactation reach the mammary gland through the circulation, saturates and inhibits PAPP-A and
is the mechanism underlying the protective effect of long lactation. We present preliminary data that
incubation of PAPP-A with serum taken from lactating females, but not from non-lactating females,
inhibits its ability to degrade IGFBP-5. Further, depletion of STC1 from lactating -female serum blocks
this effect. The goal of this exploratory award is to test if transfusions of blood from lactating donors into non-
lactating recipients during post-partum involution, can mimic the protective effect of lactation in these recipient
females. In order to test this possibility, we propose the following aims; Specific aim 1: Characterize potential
fluctuations in the serum concentration and activity of STC1 throughout lactation and determine if transfusions
of blood from lactating females can mimic the protective effect of long lactation in wild-type non-lactating mice.
Specific aim 2: Testing the protective effect of ovarian STC1 against PAPP-A driven mammary tumors. In this
aim, we will perform the same experiment described in aim 1 but in the MMTV-PAPP-A transgenic mice with two
exceptions. First, since this model is much more aggressive than normal involution without prior lactation, we
will use a more intense scheduling of transfusions. Second, since 75% of PAPP-A transgenic mice develop post-
partum mammary tumors when females do not lactate, we will monitor tumor formation."
10821304,"CELLULAR REPROGRAMMING IN PERSISTENT VS. LYTIC VIRAL INFECTIONS
PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-range goal of the proposed research is to define the cellular factors that mediate JC polyomavirus
(JCPyV) infection to better understand how virus-host cell interactions influence viral pathogenesis. JCPyV
infects up to 80% of the population and establishes a lifelong, asymptomatic persistent infection in the kidneys
of healthy individuals. However, in immunocompromised individuals JCPyV can spread to the central nervous
system (CNS) and cause a lytic infection in glial cells resulting in the fatal, demyelinating disease progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Approximately 5% of individuals with HIV develop PML, a terminal AIDS-
defining illness, and individuals receiving immunomodulatory therapies for diseases including multiple sclerosis
are at heightened risk for PML development. The increasing number of individuals receiving immunomodulatory
therapies due to immune-mediated diseases has led to a rising number of PML cases in the past decade. Over
700 total cases of PML are due to a single drug class. PML can be fatal, especially when underlying
immunosuppression is left untreated, and there are currently no approved treatments for this devastating
disease. The lack of an animal model and limited cell culture models have largely restricted studies of JCPyV to
a single transformed cell culture model. Recently-published studies have revealed that primary cell culture
models are a better representation of disease pathogenesis in vivo, and thus we have developed innovative
primary cell culture models to define cellular factors that are required for JCPyV infection. Two integrated specific
aims are proposed in this research project to: 1) characterize cellular factors that mediate JCPyV entry and
infection in primary cell types, and 2) elucidate cell-type dependent differences in persistent and lytic JCPyV
infections. This research will enhance our understanding of how virus-host cell interactions influence disease
outcomes and will serve as a platform for the development of antiviral treatments. Through this work, cellular
factors required for JCPyV entry in primary cell types will be characterized through loss- and gain-of-function
approaches using cell-based assays. Transcriptome profiling through RNA sequencing analysis will be used to
determine how JCPyV infection alters gene expression in a cell-type dependent manner to identify pathways
relevant to JCPyV pathogenesis and fatal disease outcomes. This combinatorial approach utilizes newly
developed primary cell models of JCPyV infection and takes advantage of innovative high-throughput analysis
of viral and cellular protein expression and RNA sequencing approaches. This research will fill key gaps in our
knowledge of JCPyV biology and could elucidate novel antiviral targets or provide rationale for experimental use
of on-market therapies to prevent or treat the fatal disease PML. Findings obtained from this research will also
provide broader insights into the entry and signaling networks for other pathogenic viruses, like coronaviruses,
and improve our understanding of dysregulation of cellular signaling in other diseases such as cancer."
10821305,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Skeletal muscle myopathy has been reported following infection by influenza virus. In Influenza-Associated
Myopathy (IAM), a systemic influenza infection can result in acute skeletal muscle damage that ranges from non-
specific degeneration to extensive necrosis. IAM is associated with high serum creatine kinase (CK) levels.
During the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, 62% of hospitalized patients had increased serum CK levels. Given
that an estimated 9-45 million individuals acquire influenza infections annually in the US, developing new
strategies to reduce muscle damage are needed as influenza vaccines are difficult to design because of
unpredictable changes in viral strains within and across populations. The severity of viral disease varies between
individuals and depends on how the immune system responds to infection. One roadblock to understanding the
pathogenesis of IAM is that the relative contributions of the virus and host factors in vivo are not well understood.
Biopsy studies cannot show the temporal dynamics of viral invasion and subsequent recruitment of neutrophils
and macrophages into muscle. The zebrafish is a powerful model to study host-pathogen interactions as genetic
tools can be combined with in vivo imaging of transparent embryos. My laboratory uses a recently-developed
zebrafish model of influenza A virus (IAV) infection where it was shown that: 1) IAV-infected zebrafish embryos
exhibited mild muscle degeneration with sarcolemma damage and compromised extracellular matrix (ECM)
adhesion; and 2) neutrophils localize to sites of muscle damage in IAV-infected embryos. Our specific goal in
this proposal is to determine the mechanisms through which neutrophils influence the pathology of IAM. This
project will test the novel hypothesis that overactivation of neutrophils during IAV infection triggers a damaging
hyperinflammatory response that contributes to myopathy. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that
reduction in reactive oxidative species (ROS) production following IAV infection will limit damage by
strengthening muscle cell-ECM adhesion, and increase survival. This will be accomplished by examining how
global ROS reduction and neutrophil-specific ROS reduction alters muscle degeneration, cell-ECM adhesion,
and neutrophil localization in the muscle in vivo using IAV multi-spectral fluorescent reporter (Color-flu) strains.
In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that defects in neutrophil migration following IAV infection will
increase muscle degeneration, and weaken ECM adhesion. To accomplish this, we will use in vivo confocal
imaging to study two zebrafish mutants with defective neutrophil migration infected with Color-flu to test our
hypotheses that: 1) neutrophil invasion into skeletal muscle is reduced, and 2) muscle degeneration is increased
and cell-ECM adhesion is increased over controls. One of these mutants overexpresses miR-199 in neutrophils
that disrupts neutrophil migration. Proposed RNA sequencing will allow us to determine microRNA gene
regulatory networks thereby allowing us to establish a link between IAM and microRNA genetic regulation.
Knowledge gained through the study of IAM may inform studies of other viral-associated myopathies."
10821306,"Jared Talbot Project summary:
Cell migrations are vital to generating a patterned musculature, but only a few of the cues that
activate the cell’s motility are known and it remains unclear how muscle progenitors decide to
move towards one destination versus another. Here, we will investigate the cues that activate
muscle precursor cell motility (Aim 1) and guide the migrating cells (Aim 2) using zebrafish
embryos as a model system. In vertebrate embryos, muscle precursor cell migration begins with
an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); the cells are then actively guided from somites
to new locations in the body, migrating as mesenchymal cell-streams. In mammalian embryos,
these cell streams originate from several axial levels to generate over 100 muscles in many
body regions. In zebrafish embryos, the homologous migrations are simpler, producing only four
muscles: the two limb muscles, the sole neck muscle, and the chest muscle. Paired with other
zebrafish strengths, this simplicity makes the zebrafish embryo an excellent model system for
understanding muscle precursor cell migrations. We have developed transgenic and mutant
lines that enable us to investigate muscle precursor migration in zebrafish embryos. Using these
tools, we recently demonstrated that the transcription factors six1 and six4 (collectively termed
“six1/4”) are essential for muscle precursor migration in zebrafish. In six1/4 mutants, the muscle
precursors fail to undergo EMT and fail to activate the migration-promoting gene met, which
encodes a metastasis-inducing receptor protein. Although the six1/4 mutants completely lack
precursor migration, this process is only delayed in zebrafish met mutants, suggesting that
six1/4 targets additional genes that stimulate motility. In Aim 1A, we will use an unbiased
chemical screen to identify new molecules that stimulate muscle precursor motility and
guidance. In Aim 1B, we investigate one pathway already suggested by this screen to influence
EMT during this migration. In Aim 2, we will investigate how chemokine signals influence this
migration. Muscle precursors are thought to be attracted by chemokine (Cxcl12) signaling,
which is received by the receptor Cxcr4 and antagonized by the scavenging receptor Ackr3; we
propose that the interplay of these two receptors imparts directionality to muscle precursor
migration. Chemokine signaling will be altered using genetic mutants and chemical modulators.
Cell movement will be analyzed using 3D cell tracking in transgenic embryos. Together these
experiments will provide insights into the initiation and guidance of muscle precursor cells, with
potential application in other migration-dependent processes like muscle regeneration and
metastasis."
10821308,"Abstract: Apelin Signaling Pathway In Muscle Regeneration And Rejuvenation
PI: Madelaine Romain
How extracellular signals and cell-to-cell communication dysregulation affect tissue homeostasis during aging
are still poorly understood. The age associated muscle disease, sarcopenia, affects more than 60% of people
over 80 years of age and results in mobility disorders and a significantly increased risk of mortality. Identifying
dysregulated biological mechanisms involved in the etiology of sarcopenia is critical to develop therapeutic
treatments to limit muscle atrophy. Recently, the expression of the apelin peptide has been shown to decline
with age, correlating with an increased inflammation, senescence, and degeneration of the muscle tissue.
Interestingly, treatments with the apelin peptide improve muscle regeneration and muscular function in aged
animals, indicating a role in muscle regeneration and rejuvenation. However, the molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying apelin function are largely unknown, and the apelin dependent cellular crosstalk
between muscle stem cells (MuSC), endothelial cells, and immune cells contributing to enhanced muscle
regeneration are uncharacterized. Using the zebrafish as a model system, we will combine novel
pharmacological genetic approaches to perform state of the art apelin loss and gain of function studies and use
single cell RNA sequencing to identify downstream effectors of apelin that limit the impacts of aging. We
propose to test the function of apelin as an anti-aging and pro-regenerative signaling peptide and decipher cell
type specific functions of apelin during muscle aging and regeneration. This COBRE project includes two
specific aims. During the first aim, we will use a recently discovered chemical agonist of the apelin receptors
and newly generated Cre/Lox zebrafish transgenic lines to determine how chronic and genetically-induced
muscle-derived apelin affects the hallmarks of muscle aging (atrophy, senescence, inflammation…). Novel
CRISPR/Cas-9 zebrafish mutants will also us allow to test the function of the apelin receptor activation in
MuSC, endothelial cells and macrophages to decipher the cell type-specific apelin functions during muscle
aging and regeneration. Using state of the art single cell RNA-sequencing, aim 2 will reveal a set of genes
regulating MuSC transition into proliferation after injury. Taking advantage of the apelin receptors mutant fish,
this transcriptomic analysis should also lead to the identification of regenerative factors underlying apelin
functions in MuSC-dependent regenerative response. Successful completion of these aims will define the role
of the apelin signaling in multiple different cell types during muscle aging and reveal molecular and cellular
therapeutic targets to alleviate or reverse age-associated sarcopenia."

 Optimal allocation of attention is key to achieving peak behavioral performance. A detailed understanding of
the neuronal mechanisms that control attention will be essential for any comprehensive strategies to reduce
attention lapses or treat attention disorders. Moreover, better understanding of attention is likely to provide
valuable new insights into sensory processing and perception. The visual system is an ideal subject for the study
of attention. Peak visual performance is required for many human activities, and our relatively advanced
understanding of the functional organization of the visual system makes it choice for deploying state-of-the-art
techniques in well-described and well-differentiated brain regions.
 The experiments proposed here will advance our understanding of attention by providing a comprehensive
characterization of the role of the locus coeruleus in visual attention. The locus coeruleus has long been
associated with attention and arousal. However, the specificity of its contributions to attention has received
relatively little investigation, despite many findings that suggest it has substantial functional specialization.
 Recent work in our lab has been directed at identifying distinct component of visual attention. We have shown
that different brain structures make distinct contributions to changes in attention associated with behavioral
sensitivity, selectivity, and perceptual criterion. Recently, we have used optogenetic stimulation of the locus
coeruleus in monkeys and found that it can produce a robust and selective enhancement in behavioral sensitivity.
This result emphasizes that the locus coeruleus is a potent factor in controlling visual attention, and highlights
how little we know about the role it plays in controlling the various components that make up visual attention.
 We will optogenetically activate locus coeruleus neurons to measure their influence on visual sensitivity,
selectivity and perceptual criterion, measuring both the magnitude and the dynamics of attention-related
behavioral enhancements that it mediates. To reveal how it enhances visual performance, we will record visual
responses from key visual structures – area V4, the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus – during locus
coeruleus stimulation to directly assess how it contributes to the quality of central representations of behaviorally-
relevant visual stimuli. We will also record neuronal responses from the locus coeruleus itself while monkeys do
tasks that modulate specific components of visual attention. The results from these recordings will provide a
direct, detailed appraisal of the extent of specialization that exists within the locus coeruleus.
 The locus coeruleus plays a major role in behavioral performance, yet its role has been largely overlooked
in efforts to understand the neurophysiology of visual attention. The proposed experiments will provide a precise,
comprehensive assessment of the place of the locus coeruleus in attention and will substantially advance our
understanding of the interaction of different brain structures in mediating visual behaviors."

Defects in ubiquitin (Ub) pathways are often responsible for cancer and devastating neurodegenerative
diseases. Because of its central role in biological circuits and the potential for therapeutic intervention, the Ub
system is an intense research area. Yet, Ub biology is highly complex, supported by over 500 Ub ligases and
nearly 100 deubiquitinases. Currently, this complexity and our limited understanding of Ub biology players and
their interactions are severe hindrances for targeted intervention in many diseases. Considering all possible
ways to address this complexity, two important approaches have strong potential to fundamentally
revolutionize our ability to unravel each protein's unique cellular role in Ub biology: i) sample multiplexing in
mass spectrometry-based proteomics to improve throughput at proteome-wide depth, and ii) chemical
proteomics to discover selective pharmacological tools to perturb and illuminate function.
Through efforts within the previous grant cycle, the level of sample multiplexing was increased, allowing the
proteome-wide comparison of expression and modification levels for 16 samples. In addition, a real-time
database search doubled throughput while improving quantitative accuracy. In this proposal, we now turn our
attention towards discovering chemical probes to study the Ub system through new chemical proteomics
workflows where mass spectrometry is already a mainstay. In Aim 1, we will create two next-generation
workflows—one for targeted and one for discovery proteomics—supporting isobaric tagging studies with
16plex reagents. The focus will be on fully integrating control over the scan decision process using external
software and an API for protein quantification which will improve depth and quantitative precision. Given that
reaction centers in most Ub system enzymes are cysteines (e.g., E2s, E3s, deubiquitinases), in Aim 2, we will
modify the Aim 1 workflows to allow reactive cysteine profiling in chemical proteomics. Research under this
aim will be completed with an eye toward establishing comprehensive protein-small molecule interaction
landscapes for entire libraries of electrophilic compounds on a scale of thousands of molecules. Our goal in
this Aim is to discover novel probes to Ub ligases and deubiquitinases. In Aim 3, we will create workflows to
discover small molecules that induce Ub-mediated protein degradation. We will first modify both the discovery
and targeted platforms from Aim 1 to allow us to work with starting amounts from cells growing in 96-well
screening plates. Next, a plate-based cellular assay will be developed to measure the proteome-wide
consequences of acute treatment with pools of compounds in each well, pinpointing compounds that directly
engage the Ub-proteasome system to degrade their targets. The realization of these three aims will i) provide
innovative new workflows for isobaric tagging studies, ii) generate new chemical probes as tools to study the
diverse roles of Ub in cellular processes, and iii) create new precursors for therapeutic intervention."

Computational modeling can help us formalize how choice behaviors can be optimally adapted to different
situations and investigate the ways in which individuals deviate from optimal behavior. Both anxious and
depressed individuals report difficulties with decision-making; these difficulties have consequences for social
interactions and occupational function. Understanding whether anxiety and depression are associated with
common or unique deficits in decision-making has been hampered by studies focusing on either anxiety or
depression alone and overlooking issues of comorbidity. This is important to address to better identify which
aspects of decision-making should be targets for intervention in different patient groups. The separate
investigation of anxiety- and depression-related deficits in decision-making has also led to a lack of
equivalence of tasks and limited use of both reward-related and aversive outcomes within the same study.
In the proposed research, we will conduct bifactor analysis of item-level responses to anxiety and depression
questionnaires and use participant scores on the dimensions obtained to interrogate whether deficits in decision-
making under second-order uncertainty are common to both anxiety and depression or unique to one or the
other. We focus upon second-order uncertainty as this characterizes many of the situations we encounter in
every-day life but there has been limited investigation of whether anxiety or depression are linked to deficits
in adjusting decision-making to second-order uncertainty. Second-order uncertainty arises both when the
probability of our actions resulting in certain outcomes changes across time (volatility) and when information
needed to estimate how likely a given action is to lead to a given outcome is not fully available (ambiguity).
In the proposed studies, we will use volatility and ambiguity manipulations to examine whether deficits in
decision-making under second-order uncertainty are common to both anxiety and depression or unique to one
or other and whether such deficits are domain general or domain specific (vary by outcome type: aversive,
reward gain or reward loss). On-line studies will be used to conduct replication work and to examine if impaired
decision-making under second-order uncertainty is primarily linked to internalizing symptomatology or common
to a broader range of psychopathology. These online studies will also enable us to test exploratory hypotheses
pertaining to other dimensions of psychopathology. Understanding the extent to which alterations in decision-
making under second order uncertainty are unique to anxiety or depression, common to both anxiety and
depression (i.e. a transdiagnostic marker of Internalizing psychopathology), or associated with
psychopathology more broadly is important to clarify so that we can better tailor cognitive and psycho-
educational interventions to different patient groups. It may also help clarify whether existing interventions
developed in relation to anxiety (e.g. CBT focusing on ambiguity aversion) might valuably be applied to
other forms of psychopathology."

This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on
emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the
past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being:
How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual
differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess
well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to
various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of
this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or
more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core
plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological,
behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The
measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of
EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the
development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as
prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including
psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer
science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To
arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological,
behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing
measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using
the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two
of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention
strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring
established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well-
being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot
datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network
will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB."

The Microchemistry and Proteomics (MCP) Core provides mass spectrometric sequencing and quantitation
of peptides and proteins to support basic, translational, and clinical research programs at MSK. The Core
utilizes modern high-resolution mass spectrometry and nanoscale liquid chromatography in conjuction with
biochemical processing of samples with the end goal of determining the identity, relative abundance, and
presence of post translational modifications from purified components, cell lysates, tissues, and select fluid
such as cerebral spinal fluid. Proteins and post translational modification are critical components of complex
signaling pathways underlying development, cell growth, differentiation, DNA repair, senescence, immune
response to cancer, and response to bioactive therapies. Dissection of these pathways can lead to insights on
the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in cancer. The goal of the MCP Core is to be an efficient, user
friendly, state-of-the-art facility. Advice is provided by the Core staff to facilitate the design, execution, and
analysis of experiments. Over the past year, the Core has supported research from 38 investigators. Over the
past grant period, investigators from all 10 programs have been supported, and the Core has contributed to
207 publications."

 During postnatal development sensory systems become adapted, through experience, to extract features from
complex natural environments. Transient deprivation of visual input during this sensitive period permanently
disrupts visual function. Once mature, these circuits are stabilized and do not require continuous visual input to
maintain function. Traditionally, development and rescue of vision is studied using simple oriented bars of light
composed of varying spatial frequencies (grating stimuli). Although grating stimuli effectively drive the majority
of neurons in the primary cortex (V1) and are the stimuli used to define developmental milestones such as
binocular alignment between the two eyes, it is well-recognized that simple grating stimuli are not the preferred
stimuli for most neurons in adult V1, across a range of species. Furthermore, selectivity to complex features
cannot be explained by response proﬁles evoked by simple stimuli; this is likely a general principle for multiple
sensory modalities. It is unknown when responses to complex features become mature, nor whether
interventions that improve grating spatial acuity rescue binocular vision or complex responses in amblyopic mice.
 To fill this gap in knowledge we will define the developmental trajectory of complex responses relative to
established milestones, and identify conditions that facilitate the rescue of complex-feature processing in visually
deprived mice. Neural activity in binocular V1 will be longitudinally monitored using 2-photon calcium imaging
in control and deprived mice, in combination with cell-type specific manipulation. Responses to grating and
complex stimuli will be assessed at the single-neuron and population levels. We recently demonstrated that
visual experience drives a shift in preference for complexity; the timing of this maturation occurs after the peak
of the critical period. Based on these results, in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that complex-feature responses
remain sensitive to visual deprivation past the classically defined critical period, and complex-feature processing
continues to develop as animals expand their visually-guided behavioral repertoire. Accumulating evidence
indicates that somatostatin (SOM) in coordination with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) inhibitory interneurons
mediate contextual surround modulation, a property that is fundamental to processing complex scenes.
Therefore, in Aim 2 we will characterize the maturation of SOM responses and the stabilization of grating-
response tuning relative to the emergence of complex-feature responses. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test the
hypothesis that enriched experience, in the form of association training, accelerates the stabilization of binocular
alignment and improves complex-feature processing in amblyopic mice when proceeded by rejuvenating dark
exposure. Successful completion of these aims will provide crucial cell-type specific details regarding how
responses to complex features emerge from a network comprised of neurons innately tuned to simple grating
stimuli in healthy and amblyopic mice."

The goal of the Baylor College of Medicine Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (BCM-PREP) is
to mentor post-baccalaureates (Scholars) who are underrepresented (UR) in science and medicine to be
competitive to enter into and be successful in a research-intensive biomedical Ph.D. program. BCM has a
long history of mentoring UR trainees at the undergraduate (Summer Medical Research Training, SMART,
since 1988), post-baccalaureates (BCM-PREP since 2003), and graduate (Initiative for Maximizing Student
Development, since 1998). The BCM-PREP has trained 106 Scholars since initial funding and alumni have
excellent records of achievement and productivity equivalent to non-UR trainees at BCM, positioning them for
leadership roles in the biomedical research community. Ninety-five percent (95%) of alumni are involved in
academia or jobs in science-related fields, contributing to the diversity of the US scientific workforce. These
results far exceed our goals of having 75% of alumni enrolling in a Ph.D. program in top ranked
research-intensive institutions and that at least 80% of alumni enroll and complete a Ph.D. This BCM-
PREP renewal requests an extra slot annually to train forty Scholars (8/year) over the next five years.
We propose to continue recruiting, mentoring, training, and advancing UR education in biomedical research by
supporting Scholars to work at state-of-the-art research laboratories and core facilities at BCM. The
curriculum and training include mentored, original research in a laboratory, science writing and oral
presentation skills, analysis of the scientific and medical literature, critical thinking and evaluation, responsible
conduct of research, and the principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility. Scholars will develop an individual
development plan (IDP) and learn how to maintain a continuous review of the IDP for career and personal
success. Each Scholar will be provided with academic experiences in review of foundational knowledge in
molecular and cellular biology. We will enhance UR Scholar research success with writing workshops and
scientific conference participation and mentoring for fellowship writing and grantsmanship. We will use
innovative educational experiences and practices to support development and career management and
success of our UR Scholars by mentee and mentor workshops based on the National Mentoring Research
Network and by developing teamwork skills through team-based science training developed at BCM. These
activities will advance the UR post-baccalaureates to be successful in research-intensive PhD programs and
to diversify the biomedical workforce by focusing their minds on innovative approaches and experiences to
build knowledge to decrease morbidity, mortality and improve the health of our diverse national population."

Acquired von Willebrand Syndrome (AvWS) characterized by the loss of high molecular weight multimers
(HMWMs) of von Willebrand factor (vWF) is often associated with nonphysiologic blood flows. AvWS is
found in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) or continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cf-LVADs).
Interestingly, this hemostatic abnormality associated with severe AS is fully corrected on the first day after
surgery. For AvWS associated with cf-LVADs, it disappears quickly after removal of the device, strongly
suggesting that the device itself is responsible for the syndrome. It is widely believed that the supraphysiologic
shear stress and/or long exposure time in severe AS and cf-LVADs are responsible for the loss of HMWM.
Although the destruction of HMWM is believed to be a combination of mechanical and enzymatic cleavage, the
complete mechanism still remains unclear. Also notable is that AvWS is rarely observed in pulsatile blood flow
devices. There is a need to understand the degradation mechanism of vWF and exposure time especially when
nonphysiologic blood flows are expected. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the degradation of
HMWM under fully controlled laminar through turbulent blood flow conditions in terms of power density
(energy dissipation rate per unit mass) and clinically relevant exposure times. The central hypothesis is that the
degradation of HMWM of vWF is a time-sensitive mechanoenzymatic event that occurs primarily under
turbulent flow conditions by exposing the ADAMTS13 to cleavage sites on vWF. Based on our previous
publications as well as evidence in the literature, we believe that the majority of vWF multimer degradation is
ADAMTS13 mediated. However, we recognize that there are other potential sinks and sources of vWF
including adsorption to the surfaces of a device, binding to platelets, and release of vWF from ⍺-granules of
activated platelets. We will test and account for these sinks and sources in these experiments. Successful
completion of the proposed study will allow us to i) determine the relationship between nonphysiologic blood
flow and exposure time involved in the loss of HMWM in cf-LVADs, ii) evaluate the degradation mechanism
of HMWM, and iii) characterize the mechanism in terms of mechanoenzymatic, mechanistic, and enzymatic
sensitivity through comprehensive vWF biology. Ultimately, the prospective model is expected to be a tool for
device design optimization leading to a next-generation blood pump and better clinical outcomes for patients
with AvWS."

DNA topoisomerases are types of enzymes that can specifically resolve topological stresses by transiently
introducing strand breaks into DNA molecules and enabling the rotation of the supercoiled DNA strand.
Mammalian cells encode two types of topoisomerases: type I topoisomerases (TOP1, TOP1mt, TOP3A, and
TOP3B), which introduce single strand breaks into DNA, and type II topoisomerases (TOP2A, TOP2B, and
SPO11), which introduce double strand breaks (DSBs) into DNA. This proposal focuses on type II
topoisomerases, i.e. TOP2A/2B, in human somatic cells.
 During cleavage reaction, the tyrosine in the catalytic active site of TOP2 is covalently linked to the
DNA backbone and forms the so-called topoisomerase II cleavage complex (TOP2cc). Under normal
conditions, TOP2cc forms transiently and is not detectable. However, a wide variety of topoisomerase poisons,
including etoposide, have been developed and used as chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment.
Mechanistically, etoposide acts to stabilize TOP2cc, which eventually lead to DNA strand breaks and kill tumor
cells.
 While many investigators including us investigated TOP2-induced DNA lesions and how they can be
repaired by different repair pathways, this proposal focuses on a new concept that cells have evolved distinct
pathways to avoid and limit DNA lesions induced by TOP2. In this proposal, we will determine mechanistically
how several unique TOP2 regulators act together to avoid DNA damage and therefore promote cell survival.
Results from these studies are critically important for the understanding of therapeutic response to etoposide
and other anti-cancer agents.

An estimated 800 pregnancy-related deaths occur daily. Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), with about two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) alone. Skilled care in health facilities is
critical to improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. Yet, only about two-thirds of births in SSA occur in
health facilities—with wide disparities, especially by socioeconomic status (SES). Poor person-centered
maternal care (PCMC) is a key driver of both the low rates of facility-based deliveries and disparities. Further,
where facility-based childbirth rates have increased, poor PCMC leads to morbidity and mortality due to
delayed, inadequate, unnecessary, or harmful care. Yet, there is limited research on interventions to improve
PCMC in LMICs; and existing interventions do not explicitly address inequities in PCMC experiences. To
address this gap, we designed the “Caring for Providers to Improve Patient Experience” (CPIPE) intervention
to address drivers of poor PCMC and center the unique needs of vulnerable women in LMICs. CPIPE is a
theory and evidence-based intervention with 5 components: provider training, peer support, mentorship,
embedded champions, and leadership engagement. The training is a simulation-based curriculum that
integrates content on PCMC, stress, burnout, and bias into emergency obstetric and neonatal care drills. We
target provider stress and bias because they are mutually reenforcing factors driving poor and inequitable
PCMC. The other intervention components create an enabling environment for behavior change. Our pilot
studies show high feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness. We therefore propose a cluster
randomized-controlled trial, in 40 high-volume delivery health facilities in Kenya and Ghana, to assess the
impact of CPIPE on PCMC and intermediate and distal outcomes in our conceptual model. We will accomplish
this through 3 aims. Aim 1: to assess the effectiveness of the CPIPE intervention on PCMC in Kenya and
Ghana. We hypothesize that CPIPE will improve PCMC for all women, and especially for low SES women. Our
primary outcome is PCMC measured with the PCMC scale through multiple cross-sectional surveys of mothers
who gave birth in the preceding 9 weeks in study facilities at baseline (prior to intervention), midline (6 months
post-baseline), and endline (12 months post-baseline) (N=2000 at each time point). A sub-aim 1 will assess
the cost-effectiveness of CPIPE. Aim 2: to examine the mechanisms of impact of CPIPE on PCMC. We will
assess the effect of CPIPE on intermediate outcomes such as provider knowledge, self-efficacy, stress,
burnout, and bias levels; and conduct mediation analysis to assess if changes in these outcomes account for
the effect of CPIPE on PCMC. Aim 3: to assess impact of the CPIPE intervention on distal outcomes including
maternal health seeking behavior and maternal and neonatal health; and examine if changes in PCMC account
for these effects."

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetically heterogenous disorder characterized by increased bone fragility
leading to fractures and primarily results from defects in the structure and/or the amount of secreted type I
collagen. While bone fragility is the primary cause of morbidity in OI, pulmonary compromise is the leading cause
of mortality. We and others showed that in OI there is an abnormal bone extracellular matrix (ECM) structure
and type I collagen expressing cells manifest ER stress. Pulmonary mesenchymal derived cells also abundantly
express type I collagen. We hypothesize that OI negatively impacts the lung through two mechanisms; secretion
of an abnormal ECM and chronic ER stress. Using two OI mouse models representing major forms of OI
(missense/loss of function mutations in type I collagen), this proposal will address the hypotheses that mutant
type I collagen secretion and ER stress produces abnormal pulmonary morphology, affects lung cell
differentiation, impairs lung damage recovery, and that altered ECM and ER stress negatively impact signaling
pathways. We address these hypotheses via three aims: 1. Determine the effect of type I collagen mutations on
lung postnatal homeostasis and cell differentiation/communication. Hypothesis: Mutations in type I collagen
genes lead to alterations in OI lung morphology and cell differentiation. Strategy: Using Aga2 and Col1a1+/-
mouse models, the lung will be studied at multiple stages of development via histological/immunohistochemical
(IHC) for differentiation and ECM composition. Using in vitro epithelial cell/fibroblast co-culture organoid
experiments we will define the contribution of abnormal ECM secretion to lung cell differentiation, proliferation,
and apoptosis. 2. Determine the effect of ER stress due to type I collagen mutations on lung cell differentiation,
tissue homeostasis, and reaction to damage. Hypothesis: ER stress in pulmonary type I collagen expressing
cells affect lung cell differentiation and function. Strategy: Using the models from Aim 1, we will determine ER
stress levels in pulmonary cells and whether modulating ER stress in vivo with the chaperone 4-PBA can
influence cell differentiation and homeostasis. Using organoid experiments, we will define the contribution of
chronic ER stress to lung cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. To study OI lung damage susceptibility,
we will perform in vivo treatment of WT, Aga2, and Col1a1+/- mice with bleomycin to observe the effects of cellular
damage on OI lung tissue in conjunction with the 4-PBA treatment; 3. Identify changes in lung cell population
distribution and gene expression in the context of an abnormal ECM and ER stress. Hypothesis: Lungs with
altered ECM and ER stress affect signaling pathways important in cell differentiation and function. Strategy:
Using the Aga2 and Col1a1+/- mouse models, single-cell RNA-seq cells/tissues derived from lung will be
performed to identify changes in cell development and gene expression correlated with signaling cascades
localized to specific lung cell populations. Completion of these aims will reveal causative mechanisms while
introducing novel treatment methods of OI pulmonary dysfunction, the major cause of mortality in OI."

The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is among the most utilized model organisms for biomedical research
due to its excellent genetics and accessible cell biology. The complete genome of this very small simple animal
is well annotated and a large genetic toolkit is available for its study. Most of the adult anatomy has been
reconstructed from electron microscopy (EM) micrographs of serial thin sections. However, EM techniques and
interpretation of EM micrographs are challenging and frequently rely on specialized expertise. Furthermore,
much of the EM data used for the original anatomical descriptions of C. elegans are not easily accessed except
through the support of this grant. The long-term objective for the Center for C. elegans Anatomy is to be the
preeminent source of anatomical knowledge and data on C. elegans for the research community and to help
train graduate students and postdocs in the art of EM. We make anatomical data easily interpretable for novices,
comprehensive for those seeking detailed information, and freely available through our online platforms. The
Center does this by 1) publishing detailed information regarding the anatomy of the nematode in the form of
annotated EM and light micrographs, graphical illustrations, and corresponding text as anatomical handbooks
on our WormAtlas website. During the upcoming project period we will create new content on C. elegans
organelle structure and detailed descriptions of glia. We will also pilot the introduction of other biomedically
relevant nematode species into our anatomical handbooks. 2) We host and make available the largest collection
of EM data through our online WormImage database. Most of these data were collected as photographic
negatives and prints and subsequently digitized and annotated by the Center. During the upcoming period we
will add new data sets of both C. elegans and other nematode species. Furthermore, we will collaborate with the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications to develop 3D models based on several reference EM
datasets. 3) The Center regularly provides practical training in modern EM methods for students and postdoctoral
associates. The Center also tests and develops new EM methods for C. elegans. Finally, we also conduct new
EM surveys of the wild type anatomy at key developmental stages to supplement the Atlas, and to fill in gaps in
our general knowledge of C. elegans anatomy."

 Rigor and reproducibility in zebrafish research are in jeopardy because current storage methods to
preserve zebrafish germplasm are inadequate. This is especially problematic for the most frequently used
reference strains such as AB, Tübingen (TU), and their hybrid derivatives SAT and NHGRI, which are used for
genome editing applications that critically depend on the accuracy of sequence information. The original DNA
sequences for the four reference strains were generated years ago in select individuals, and random genetic
drift has gradually modified these genome sequences. Other animal models rely on cryopreservation of the
embryo; however, we currently have no working protocols for zebrafish embryo cryopreservation. Despite recent
optimization, sperm cryopreservation – the current method for germplasm conservation – preserves only male-
derived genomes. Although the cryopreserved haploid paternal genome remains stable over time, genome
changes accumulate in live stocks used to provide females. Thus, half the embryo's genome is the same as the
original fish, and half is not.
 We will develop an integrated platform for diploid germplasm conservation in zebrafish for the four
reference strains. This platform will help preserve the entire genome close to the published sequence information
or new sequences when they become available. To accomplish this goal, our laboratory at Michigan State
University (MSU) will collaborate with the Aquatic Germplasm and Genetic Resources Center (AGGRC) at
Louisiana State University Agricultural Center (LSUAC) and the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC)
at the University of Oregon. The new integrated platform for diploid germplasm conservation encompasses two
key steps: 1) isolation, culture, and cryopreservation of diploid somatic cells, and 2) thawing of cells and using
them to derive the original strain by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT – cloning), which is a technique we have
successfully applied to produce founder individuals. This method preserves the sequence of all alleles and
genomes. The specific aims for this project are: Aim 1. Development of an integrated platform to isolate, culture,
cryopreserve and genotype diploid cells from wild-type lines. Aim 2. Standardization of the zebrafish cloning
procedure, including the generation of homozygous zebrafish lines. Aim 3. Promotion, dissemination, and
training of resource center and laboratory personnel using the diploid somatic cell conservation method. At the
end of this R24 proposal, the scientific community will have access to: 1) stable diploid genomes of the most
used reference lines, which is not possible by sperm cryopreservation, increasing the rigor and reproducibility of
experimental results within and between laboratories; and 2) homozygous zebrafish capable of enhancing
studies in cell and organ transplantation, sex determination, and other approaches. We will also show that this
new integrated platform will be capable of: 1) rescuing precious research lines on the brink of extinction when
only adult animals of one sex remain alive, and 2) eliminating pathogens from contaminated lines."

This application is an ancillary study of the PREDIMED-Plus trial to examine the effects of a diet and lifestyle
intervention on incidence of T2D as a secondary endpoint among 4,770 participants who were non-diabetics
at baseline. PREDIMED-Plus is an ongoing primary cardiovascular prevention trial (www.predimedplus.com),
which has recruited 6,874 women and men (aged 55 to 75 years) between October 2013 and December
2016. Participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (MedDiet)
group, with physical activity and behavioral support for weight loss; or a control group receiving low-intensity
advice on the MedDiet. The intervention will last 6 years. We will examine four Specific Aims. First, we will
evaluate whether an intensive lifestyle intervention consisting of an energy-reduced MedDiet, increased
physical activity, and weight loss, reduces the incidence of T2D comparied with the control group
(intervention group n=2,384; control group n=2,451). Second, we will evaluate the effect of the lifestyle
intervention on total fat mass and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measured by Dual-energy X-ray
Absorptiometry (DXA) after 1, 3, and 6-year intervention in a subsample (n=1,569). Third, we will examine
whether the lifestyle intervention modifies the association of the metabolite risk score (MRS) with the
incidence of T2D in a nested case-control study (n=620 incident T2D cases and 620 matched controls).
These analyses will be replicated in the multi-ethnic US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP, 775 cases and
1,386 non-cases from the placebo/lifestyle groups). Fourth, we will examine whether the intervention induces
beneficial changes in stool metabolites from baseline to year 1, in a subsample of 250 participants in the
intervention group and 250 in the control group. We will also examine whether changes in stool metabolites
are associated with changes in gut microbiome induced by the intervention. The preliminary results among
the PREDIMED-Plus participants showed that the intervention significantly reduced body weight and HbA1c,
which was sustained over three years. This study builds upon a large RCT and will be the first and largest of
its kind to prospectively assess the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention on plasma and stool
metabolites and the risk of T2D, using the state-of-the-art LC-MS platform and cutting-edge bioinformatics
and statistical methods. Objective measures will be used to assess functional fitness (a 30-second chair sit-
and-stand (CSS) test), physical activity (accelerometers), body composition (DXA), and extra-virgin olive oil
consumption (urinary tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol levels). This application has the potential to advance our
understanding of T2D pathophysiology and inform precision nutrition and T2D prevention. It has important
implications for the US population because it may provide further evidence to strengthen current
recommendations on the MedDiet as a part of a healthy lifestyle for chronic disease prevention."

myofiber and are positioned to maximize their internuclear distance. Our objective is the identification of
mechanisms responsible for myonuclear movement and positioning. Centrally located myonuclei have been
used for decades as a hallmark of muscle disease. However, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms
that control myonuclear movement normally and the contribution of aberrant myonuclear position to the etiology
and/or progression of muscle disease. Building on our published results over funding period (e.g. Metzger et al.,
2012; Folker et al., 2012, 2014; Schulman et al., 2013, 2014; Azevedo et al., 2016; Manhart et al., 2018, 2020;
Rosen et al., 2019), our specific aims are to first address mechanistically how tendon and motoneurons signal
to the myofiber to fine-tune myonuclear positioning. We identified two signaling pathways at the myotendinous
junction that regulate nuclear positioning. Likewise, we will dissect the contribution of the motoneuron to nuclear
placement. Secondly, we will examine why muscles fail to function optimally when myonuclei are mispositioned.
Muscle physiology will be assayed through testing mitochondrial function via quantification of ATP and ROS
levels and by testing neuromuscular communication via electrophysiological approaches. We will also investigate
the input to muscle function of specific metabolic and signaling proteins that we identified are misregulated as a
result of mispositioned myonuclei. Thirdly, we will push forward our dissection of the myonuclear positioning
mechanisms from fly to the human system. We will employ human 3D muscle cultures that are co-cultured with
motoneurons to define and then perturb myonuclear movement and positioning as the myofibers develop. Our
methodologies take advantage of cutting edge, in vivo time lapse imaging approaches that we have developed
in Drosophila and will also apply to human 3D cultures to follow myonuclear movement and cytoskeletal
dynamics. We will employ the genetic resources available in Drosophila and human cultures to manipulate genes,
processes, and cell types for our analyses. These genetic experiments will be supported by biochemical and cell
biological approaches. Together the work outlined in this proposal will shed new light on this little understood,
but important area of muscle biology. The results of this research will permit us to highlight genes and
mechanisms that are candidates for changes associated with different human muscle diseases."
10764213,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a debilitating disease in which occlusion of the peripheral arteries of
the lung causes elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance that culminates in right heart failure. In this proposal,
we relate the progressive nature of PAH to the impact of high shear stress (HSS) on pulmonary arterial (PA)
endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) gene regulation and function with the view that we might be able
to use this mechanistic information to reverse established disease. In response to a previous RFA on ‘integrative
omics’, we related PAEC enhancer promoter interactions to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under
physiologic conditions of laminar shear stress (LSS). LSS resulted in differential chromatin accessibility,
assessed by ATAC Seq, at sites where the transcription factor KLF4 bound DNA at H3K27ac enhancer sites, as
assessed by ChIP Seq. However, we could only relate the LSS enhancers to one third of DEGs on the basis of
‘nearest gene’. By incorporating HiChIP and the Activity by Contact (ABC) algorithm, we were able to relate
distal enhancers to 80% of DEGs, including skipped genes and those related to PAH, such as BMPR2. HSS is
prevalent when there is established vascular disease narrowing the vascular lumen, or if PAH is initiated by the
high pulmonary blood flow and pressure of a congenital heart defect. In our Preliminary Studies, we show that
HSS has a major impact on expression of PAEC homeostatic genes such as BMPR2, JAG1, ERG, and ELN;
moreover, there is heightened expression of endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT) genes, such as
SNAI1, and increased PAEC permeability and monocyte adhesion. Our ability to build PA EC-SMC bilayers in
fibrin gels allows us to study vascular cell interactions under LSS and HSS. Our overarching hypothesis is that
changes in PAEC and PAEC-SMC interaction in response to HSS adversely impact the enhancer landscape,
gene regulation and function, and can be reversed to prevent progressive PAH pathology. To investigate this,
we propose three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we characterize perturbations in the enhancer-promoter
landscape that account for aberrant gene regulation under HSS in control and PAH PAEC, and we link these
features to functional abnormalities in permeability, inflammation and EndMT, and to changes in genes and
proteins in the PA tissue of PAH patients. In Specific Aim 2, we biofabricate tubular structures with PAEC lining
the lumen and SMC surrounding the EC, to determine how cell-cell interactions impact HSS vs LSS mediated
gene regulation and function, including SMC proliferation and elastin fiber formation. In Specific Aim 3, we
focus on the pronounced HSS mediated reduction in ERG in control and PAH PAEC, to determine if this feature
is necessary and sufficient for the HSS-mediated abnormal PAEC gene expression and function. We determine
whether the HSS mediated elevation in miR-96 and the reduction in ERG can be subverted by the miR-96
antagomir, both in PAH cells and in a transgenic mouse with deficient ERG. These studies should provide new
avenues for intervention to reverse disease by subverting the root cause of HSS mediated-progressive PAH."
10792465,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of progressive interstitial fibrosis, which leads to severe
debilitation and eventually respiratory failure and death. Protein folding stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER
stress) triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has been implicated in IPF. The most deeply
conserved mediator of the UPR is IRE1α, a bifunctional kinase/endoribonuclease that mediates XBP1 mRNA
splicing, degradation of ER-localized mRNAs (RIDD), and degradation of the microRNA miR-17. Under severe
ER stress, IRE1α hyperactivity promotes cell death, a condition termed the terminal UPR. A parsimonious view
holds that the terminal UPR causes ongoing alveolar epithelial cell death which leads ultimately to fibrosis.
 The laboratory of Dr. Feroz Papa (co-mentor) developed and characterized Kinase Inhibiting RNase
Attenuator (KIRA) compounds that inhibit all the major functions of IRE1α. We previously showed that mice
treated with KIRA compounds were protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. In new preliminary data, a mono-
selective KIRA compound decreased miR-17 degradation, TGFβ signaling and the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) in the lung epithelium after bleomycin. In fibrotic mouse lungs and human IPF lungs,
these IRE1α-regulated pathological gene signatures were preferentially found in dysfunctional progenitor cells.
These results challenge the current paradigm that the UPR contributes to fibrosis exclusively through cell death.
 Instead, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that hyperactivation of IRE1α in injured epithelial
progenitor cells triggers a network of mutually reinforcing fibrotic pathways, including gene repression by miR-
17, senescence, and TGFβ signaling. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that IRE1α is necessary and
sufficient for epithelial progenitor cell dysfunction by interrogating the effects of chemical or genetic inhibition of
IRE1α in the bleomycin model and two genetic models of fibrosis based on senescence (Sin3a knockout) and
ER stress (SftpcC121G). Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that IRE1α regulates progenitor cell dysfunction
through miR-17 using conditional deletion and conditional overexpression mice.
 The training plan is focused on the skills and concepts of lung regeneration and developmental biology,
in vitro models of lung biology, epithelial cell dysfunction, and responsible laboratory management. Training will
include didactic courses, focused symposia, and international conferences. The primary mentor and co-mentor
are Dr. Dean Sheppard and Dr. Feroz Papa, both accomplished physician-scientists with long track records of
mentorship. Dr. Auyeung has laboratory and office space at the UCSF Mission Bay campus, a fertile environment
for collaboration with ready access to the facilities and equipment necessary for this research.
 In summary this Career Development Award application merges an exceptional candidate, an innovative
and tractable research plan, rigorous training, and the support of world-class physician-scientists into a powerful
springboard for the launch of a productive and independent career with high impact on lung disease."
10768645,"Brief alcohol interventions (BAI) are among the most cost-effective preventive care measures available and the
evaluation of these interventions with high-risk and difficult-to-reach populations is an NIAAA priority. Although
emerging adults (EAs) who attend college often have access to brief alcohol interventions (BAIs), there is a
critical need to enhance both the efficacy and potential for dissemination of these approaches with high-risk
non-student EAs. EAs who are not 4-year college students or graduates report higher levels of alcohol-related
problems, greater levels of comorbid drug use and mental health symptoms, and higher risk for chronic alcohol
use disorder compared to college graduates. Most BAIs include a single session focused explicitly on
discussing risks associated with drinking and correcting normative beliefs about drinking rates without
addressing the reasons why EAs may drink, including stress and limited behavioral alternatives to drinking.
Because many EAs who do not graduate from college are socially and economically marginalized, an
approach that encourages them to drink less without providing the tools to reduce stress and develop mood-
enhancing behavioral substitutes to drinking or drug use is unlikely to be successful. The Substance-Free
Activity Session (SFAS) attempts to increase engagement goal-directed activities that might provide
alternatives to alcohol use and also includes strategies for coping with stress/depression. The two-session
(plus booster) BAI+SFAS approach has demonstrated efficacy for reducing both alcohol use/problems and
depressive symptoms in two randomized clinical trials with college EAs and may be a more promising
approach than single-session BAIs for higher-risk non-student EAs. Two critical next steps are to: 1) evaluate
the BAI+SFAS with non-student EAs, and 2) determine if a two-session Relaxation Training (RT) +SFAS
approach, which would enhance wellness and address two synergistic risk factors for alcohol misuse,
demonstrates similar efficacy as the BAI+SFAS intervention. If so, this wellness-based approach may have
greater potential for dissemination than approaches that include a BAI because the session content may be
more appealing to EAs (managing stress and increasing positive activities). Thus, the primary goal of the
proposed study is to establish the efficacy of these novel BAI approaches with high-risk community dwelling
EAs, and a secondary goal is to identify factors that may increase potential for dissemination. We will conduct
a randomized 3-group (BAI+SFAS vs. RT+SFAS vs. education control) trial with 525 EAs (175 per group;
estimated 50% women & 50% African American) who report recent heavy drinking and who are not students or
graduates of 4-year colleges. Outcomes will be assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. We
hypothesize that at follow-up both BAI+SFAS and RT+SFAS participants will report significantly greater
reductions in alcohol use and problems relative to education control participants, with no differences in
outcomes between the two active treatment conditions."
10788293,"Project Summary/Abstract
Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are blood disorders that affect about 300,000 people in the
U.S. Blood clotting complications and bone marrow failure can cause death, as can the development of an
incurable leukemia. Curative therapy by stem cell transplant is rarely possible. Aberrant regulation of a
protein called JAK2 drives these disorders, and while JAK2 inhibitors improve MPN patient symptoms they do
not induce remission, with inherent drug resistance being a major clinical bottleneck. Our recent studies
suggest a protein called SHP2 plays a unique role in the response of MPN cells to the FDA-approved JAK
inhibitor ruxolitinib. Therapeutically targeting SHP2 is now possible following the recent development of drugs
that function as molecular glue to keep SHP2 stuck in an inactive state. The upfront survival of MPN cells in
the face of ruxolitinib treatment is a form of drug resistance called persistence. Our current studies show that
ruxolitinib persistent cells are more sensitive to SHP2 inhibition than cells that have never been exposed to
ruxolitinib. In the latter cells ruxolitinib inhibits JAK2-dependent signals including STAT and ERK proteins.
However, ERK rapidly becomes re-activated even while ruxolitinib is still present. We have observed that
SHP2 inhibition blocks this re-activation of ERK. Since ERK can promote cell growth/survival, it is possible
that altered SHP2 regulation during ruxolitinib treatment leads to cell survival. Interestingly, the activation
states of proteins that mediate JAK2 signaling respond differently to SHP2 inhibition in persistent cells,
suggesting cell signaling during ruxolitinib persistence is in a re-wired state. This may explain our
observations that SHP2 inhibition can prevent a ruxolitinib persistent state. Thus, SHP2 may provide a
vulnerability that can be exploited to improve MPN therapy, which is further supported by our observations
that SHP2 inhibition can antagonize disease in an MPN mouse model and can improve the inhibitory effect of
ruxolitinib on cells from MPN patients. The major objective of this application is to determine the extent to
which SHP2 inhibition overcomes barriers of current anti-JAK2 MPN therapy. The central hypothesis is that
targeting SHP2 will thwart the development of JAK2 inhibitor persistence, which is observed in MPN patients.
We will utilize cellular, genetic, and biological approaches, including mouse models and cells from MPN
patients in our studies. Experiments in aim 1 will determine mechanistic details by which SHP2 inhibition
sensitizes MPN cells to JAK2 inhibition; in aim 2 will assess the role of SHP2 in drug persistence; and in aim
3 will determine the molecular basis/consequences of altered SHP2 signaling in response to ruxolitinib, which
has potential to help develop new therapeutic approaches based on our novel observations. Our studies are
innovative because the unique role of SHP2 in response to JAK2 inhibitor treatment is completely unknown
and utilizing SHP2 as a therapeutic target in these MPNs has never been tested. Our studies could contribute
to the development of effective therapies for the 300,000 people in the U.S. who suffer with an MPN."

Many global proteomics studies have focused on the measurement of protein abundance and post-
translational modification status as measures of cellular function. These approaches, while highly informative,
are not sufficient as standalone approaches to address the role of genetic variation on human protein function
in a high-throughput manner. Our preliminary findings show that thermal proteome profiling (TPP) can
measure changes in missense mutant protein stability as well as the impacts of mutant protein stability
changes on protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We hypothesize that TPP will be sufficient to provide molecular
characterization of protein biophysical changes as a consequence of missense mutations associated with
human genetic disease. The initial work will focus on the optimization of TPP dataset analysis through
development of normalization approaches, curve fitting, and determination of key quality control cutoffs for
applications related to human genetic diseases. In parallel, we will perform mutant TPP analysis of human
genetic disease-associated protein sequence variants in the RNA-DNA helicase Senataxin and in multiple
subunits of the human RNA exosome. Numerous mutations in Senataxin and subunits of the RNA exosome
have been clinically associated with the rare neurodegenerative diseases: Ataxia Oculomotor Apraxia 2
(AOA2), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 4 (ALS4), and PontoCerebellar Hypoplasia (PCH). In addition to these
clinically characterized mutations, a number of additional variants have been identified of unknown clinical
significance. We propose that mutant TPP could be used to determine if these uncharacterized sequence
variants have similar or unique thermal profiles relative to known disease- causing variants. In addition to
mutant TPP analyses, we will perform RNA-Sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of a
selection of mutants to further delve into the functional consequences of mutant protein expression. Changes
in gene dosage for disease causing mutants and the impact of gene dosage on TPP outcomes will also be
explored through our recently developed approach for allele-specific thermal profiling. Allele-specific thermal
profiling is not possible through non-mass spectrometry-based methods such as ELISA since determination of
protein sequence will be required to differentiate the slight changes in protein sequence. Long-term goals
include development of mutant TPP analysis to facilitate measurement of protein expression buffering of
deleterious alleles, protein-protein interaction network changes, and the impact of altered variant protein levels
on the correlation between mRNA and protein abundance levels."

This proposal focuses on the divergent effects of the two major dietary forms of vitamin K on breast cancer. K
vitamins act as cofactors for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which post-translationally introduces γ-
carboxyglutamate residues into proteins. Although most of the 17 known γ-carboxylated proteins function in
coagulation and bone homeostasis, the presence of GGCX in most tissues (including mammary gland) suggests
more extensive physiological roles for vitamin K. We have demonstrated that triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cell lines express GGCX and produce γ-carboxylated proteins in response to vitamin K1 (phylloquinone),
the major dietary form. In TNBC cells, K1 treatment enriches for the stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase
1 (ALDH1) and promotes mammosphere formation. These data suggest that K1 sustains GGXC mediated γ-
carboxylation to drive aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Through analysis of genomic cancer datasets, we
find that ~25% of breast tumors express GGCX and the vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKOR) genes required for its
activity. Patients with such tumors have poorer survival than those whose tumors do not express these genes at
high levels. Patients with this subtype of tumor would be candidates for therapies that limit K1 availability and/or
inhibit GGCX. Surprisingly, we found that vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4), another naturally occurring form present
in diet, does not stimulate γ-carboxylation or stem cell phenotypes in TNBC cells, but instead strongly suppresses
cell growth, migration and energy metabolism. These provocative data indicate that K1 and K2 exert distinct
effects on breast cancer cells, with K1 promoting and K2 suppressing aggressive phenotypes. We also found
that expression of the vitamin K2 biosynthesis enzyme UbiA Prenyltransferase Domain Containing 1 (UBIAD1)
is undetectable in TNBC, suggesting altered cellular handling of vitamin K. In Aim 1 we will dissect the effects
of K1 and K2 in vitro, evaluate the role of UBIAD1 and conduct feeding studies to measure accumulation of K1
and K2 in TNBC xenografts and host mammary gland in relation to tumor growth. In Aim 2 we will determine
whether deletion of GGCX from TNBC cells impacts γ-carboxylated protein synthesis and aggressive
phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 will identify relevant γ-carboxylated GGCX substrate proteins that mediate
the effects of K1. We anticipate that growth of tumors with high GGCX activity and low UBIAD1 will be stimulated
by high dietary K1 and inhibited by high dietary K2. These findings would identify GGCX as an oncogene and
the vitamin K pathway as a therapeutic target in a subset of patients with advanced breast cancer."

Mental health and developmental disorders begin early in life, are prevalent, impairing, and predict mental
health and health challenges in later childhood and in adulthood. One in nine preschoolers has an impairing
mental health disorder, yet less than 15% receive any treatment. In immigrant communities, the disparity
between mental health needs and care is greater because of cultural and language barriers, limited mental
health literacy, and decreased use of health IT solutions, like Electronic Health Record (EHR) patient portals.
Chinese American immigrant families are a fast-growing immigrant group with unmet early childhood mental
health needs. We propose to design, build, and implement OurChild, an integrated mHealth/EHR solution
to increase access to early childhood mental health knowledge and mental health services and
resources for Chinese American children ages 2-6 years old and their parents in Sunset Park,
Brooklyn. Our proposal unites our longstanding partnership with the Chinese American community in Sunset
Park and the safety-net clinics serving it with our team's 1) clinical and scientific expertise in health disparities,
participatory research and early childhood mental health and 2) the digital health/health IT expertise of the
WonderLab, a digital incubator in the NYU Langone Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Our goal
is to reduce health disparities by explicitly designing a digital solution that facilitates connection and
bidirectional exchange of information across the cultural, contextual, language, and setting differences that are
key barriers to early childhood mental health knowledge and access to care for this immigrant population. Our
first aim is to iteratively design, build, and test OurChild. To do this we will 1) collaborate with our family,
clinical, and community stakeholders to conduct an early childhood mental health context/needs analysis and
participatory design and discovery activities; 2) use these insights to adapt and user-test iterative prototypes;
3) evaluate the usability and acceptability of a beta version of OurChild in a mixed-methods pilot with 20
Chinese American parents and their 2- to 6-year-old children who receive care at the Sunset Park 7th Avenue
Family Health Center; and 4) optimize the design, features, and performance to create OurChild 1.0.Our
second aim it to evaluate the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, and Implementation of OurChild 1.0 with a 6-
month longitudinal implementation cohort study with 200 parent/child dyads. We will use a mixed-methods
approach using metadata collected with the OurChild app, parent-reported data from the app, EHR data, and
post-implementation focus groups with providers to determine whether use of Our Child increases referrals of
young children for a mental health consultation or evaluation (Primary Aim). Our secondary aims will examine
whether use of OurChild 1) increases parent self-efficacy; 2) parent–provider engagement; and 3) linkage with
community early childhood resources. Both OurChild and our digital methodology will be designed to be scaled
to other Chinese populations and efficiently adapted for other health disparity populations."

The purpose of the NIDDK R25 Research Education Training Program, DULCE (Diabetes InqUiry through
a Learning Collaborative Experience) at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine is to inspire
medical students to pursue careers in diabetes mellitus (DM) research through exposure to the full continuum
from basic science to translational DM research and the interdisciplinary collaboration needed to care for
patients with DM. Given the increasing number of Americans with diabetes mellitus (DM), it is imperative that
our physician-scientist work force is well prepared to address the needs of this growing population and keep
pace with DM innovation. The University of Chicago is home to two strong DM research centers whose
investigators currently have $31.5 million in grant funding from NIDDK and represent research that spans basic
science, clinical translational, community based, and policy research. UC also provides high caliber clinical
care through the Kovler Diabetes Center and other highly ranked clinical programs. The Pritzker School of
Medicine (PSOM) has the potential to be a leader in training underrepresented minorities in DM research; in
2021, 36% of the entering PSOM class is Black/African American and Latinx. Furthermore, 42% of incoming
PSOM students express interest in conducting DM research. While the PSOM has a track record in training
students in research, we lack a program focused on DM. To address the gaps in the current physician scientist
workforce and meet the needs of our current students’ interest in DM research, we will develop, implement,
and evaluate DULCE. We propose this novel longitudinal research education program for eight medical
students per year during their first and second year of medical school consisting of a short-term basic science,
clinical, or community health research experience combined with a structured didactic seminar series and
interdisciplinary clinical shadowing experiences. DULCE will provide students with concrete experiences in DM
research and clinical shadowing, reflective observation through regular meetings with peers and physician
scientists, learning of new theories through participation in multidisciplinary clinical and research seminars, and
application of new concepts through an intensive mentored research project. DULCE’s evaluation will be based
on assessments of students’ research self-efficacy, their attitudes towards DM research, their exposure to the
roles of interdisciplinary health professions in DM care, and their ability to contribute to a research project. We
will also assess their interest in pursuing a research career in DM and their productivity in a future career in DM
research through tracking of conference presentations and publications. Our goal through DULCE is to provide
PSOM students with a better understanding of the spectrum of DM research and interdisciplinary collaboration,
inspiring them to pursue careers in DM research."

RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which catalyzes mRNA synthesis, is co-regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs) and phosphatases to control transcription cycle progression and ensure coupling of elongation and
processing. Derangements of the RNAPII cycle underlie cancer and other diseases; CDKs and phosphatases
are potential drug targets, but how they collaborate to regulate gene expression is largely unknown. We seek
to determine how specific phosphorylations are placed and removed in precise order to execute transitions
between phases of transcription. In the past five years we uncovered two CDK-phosphatase switches that
regulate RNAPII elongation. Our goals for the next five years are to understand how these circuits work to
coordinate the transcription cycle, and how they might be disrupted with small molecules.
Dissecting CDK-PPP switches: We identified two members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family
as targets of inhibitory phosphorylation by Cdk9 (P-TEFb). PP4 and PP1 dephosphorylate the Cdk9 substrate
Spt5 to regulate the onset and end of rapid elongation, respectively. To define roles of Cdk9-PPP crosstalk in
transcription, we will introduce mutations that lock PP4 or PP1 in constitutively active (unphosphorylated) or
inactive (phosphorylated) states and analyze genome-wide effects on RNAPII dynamics and gene expression.
Unraveling control of RNAPII elongation by PPP family phosphatases: PP4 and the related PP2A,
another phosphatase recruited to transcription complexes, dephosphorylate Spt5 with similar site specificity,
and may cooperate to regulate RNAPII release from the promoter-proximal pause. We plan integrated genomic
analyses to ask whether PP4 and PP2A work independently, in combination, or in response to different signals.
Understanding how phosphorylation events are ordered in the RNAPII cycle: By analogy with the cell
division cycle—also regulated by CDKs—the order of phosphorylations during transcription is likely determined
by substrate specificities of CDKs and phosphatases, and by structural features of the substrates themselves.
We will test this hypothesis for Cdk9, which has scores of substrates and is active throughout elongation.
Functional dissection of a conserved elongation regulator: Spt5, large subunit of the conserved elongation
factor DSIF, is the linchpin of elongation control by Cdk9-PPP switches; phosphorylations placed by Cdk9 at
different sites in Spt5 are removed at different times by PP4 or PP1 and are likely to perform different functions
in the transcription cycle. We will take a genome editing approach in human cells to dissect the functions of
distinct Spt5 phosphorylations, and to elucidate their differential regulation by CDKs and phosphatases.
Illuminating a link between transcription and cell cycle control: One CDK is a core component of both
cell-division and transcriptional machineries: the TFIIH-associated Cdk7. As human cells re-enter the division
cycle from quiescence, chromatin-bound Cdk7 is activated, potentially enhancing its function in G1-specific
gene transcription. We will test this model and identify pathways that lead to Cdk7 activation at cell cycle entry."

 The goal of this project is to investigate potential mechanistic roles of sensory inputs and cholinergic
modulation for generating neural coding of location and movement speed. The results are expected to support
development of models of network mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Representations for spatial
location and movement speed are important for path integration and memory-guided navigation. Recordings of
grid cells and theta oscillations in the medial entorhinal cortex in freely exploring mice under conditions of light
and complete darkness will first address the question how long the neuronal code for location by grid cell firing
and the code for movement speed by theta frequency are preserved in working memory in the absence of
visual inputs. Analysis of the acquired data will test the hypothesis that changes in spatial periodic grid cell
firing correlate in time with changes in the theta frequency vs. running speed relationship. The expected
outcomes of these analyses will be used to inform computational models of path integration, including models
of grid cell firing. Experiments under Specific Aim #2 will use fiber photometry for monitoring cholinergic activity
in the medial entorhinal cortex to address the role of cholinergic modulation in forming and preserving codes
for location and movement speed in the presence and absence of visual cues. Analyses will test if changes in
sensory inputs, neuronal activity, and cholinergic modulation correlate at different time scales. These analyses
will further our mechanistic understanding of coding principles underlying a broad range of cognitive processes
associated with spatial memory. Both grid cells and cholinergic modulation are essential in current models of
spatial memory and memory-guided navigation. Experiments under Specific Aim #3 will use optogenetic
inhibition of cholinergic projection neurons in the medial septum in combination with grid cell recordings in the
medial entorhinal cortex to test the hypothesis that cholinergic signaling is necessary for spatial periodic firing
of grid cells. Finally, experiments under Specific Aim #4 will investigate if auditory and olfactory cues are
sufficient to support the formation of a cognitive spatial map by grid cell firing in the medial entorhinal cortex.
Simultaneous recording of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and monitoring of cholinergic activity by
fiber photometry in complete darkness during the presence or absence of auditory or olfactory cues will test the
hypotheses that auditory and olfactory inputs in isolation can be used to form a cognitive map that supports
path integration and that cholinergic modulation supports memory-guided navigation based on these maps.
 The experimental and computational skills developed during the training period of this project and the
additional theoretical training in neural data science and computational modeling will be crucial for the
accomplishment of the proposed short- and long-term scientific goals and will become the foundation for the
future work as an independent researcher."
10793324,"Summary: Sexual and gender minority (e.g. lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer; SGM) emerging adults (18-25
years) experience sexual violence (SV) at a rate nearly double that of their heterosexual, cisgender peers.
After experiencing SV, most college students disclose this experience to a peer in search of support, and 83%
of SGM survivors disclose this experience to a peer who is SGM. Peers often provide negative social reactions
to disclosures of SV, which lead to negative outcomes for all emerging adults; SGM individuals face additional
negativity due to minority stress, leading to increased levels of hazardous drinking as well as negative mental
health outcomes. Interventions need to be developed and tested to improve the social reactions provided by
SGM friends of SGM SV survivors. One such program, SSS, has demonstrated modest reductions in negative
social reactions among program participants. SSS is a 2-hour in-person interactive workshop followed by a 90
minute booster, delivered in groups and co-facilitated, but needs to be tailored to improve social reactions
provided to SGM survivors by SGM peers. Specific Aim 1: Tailor an intervention (SSS+) to improve social
reactions provided by SGM emerging adults who receive disclosures of SV experienced among their SGM
peers. We will conduct theater testing (N=30) with SGM emerging adults in the Charlotte, NC area. Theater
testing is a methodology for pre-testing interventions or products with groups of people. We will show
participants a video recorded demonstration of SSS and a brief summary of the booster. The video will be
stopped periodically for feedback on SGM-specific adaptations. Using theater testing data, input from an
advisory board of 10 SGM, mental health, and SV experts, and PI and Co-I expertise, we will systematically
reconstruct the SSS program to become SSS+. Specific Aim 2: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of
SSS+. We will include a stratified sample of n=20 SGM emerging adults to participate in the tailored in-person
skills training. The intervention will be evaluated for its acceptability (i.e., qualitative feedback and general
satisfaction scores). Initial feasibility will be determined by attendance and participant engagement and fidelity
checks. Specific Aim 3: Assess SSS+ effects on intentions to provide better general and alcohol-specific
social reactions using pilot RCT design. We will recruit n=178 SGM emerging adults to the study and randomly
assign them (1:1 allocation ratio) to receive the intervention (n=89) or receive an attention control (n=89). A
pre-post design will be used to assess the intervention’s association with intentions to provide positive and
negative social reactions using a modified version of the Social Reactions Questionnaire and Social Reactions
Questionnaire-Alcohol. Completion of this study will result in an SGM-focused intervention to improve social
reactions provided upon disclosure of SV among SGM emerging adults, which may lead to reductions in
problematic drinking and other deleterious outcomes for this vulnerable group."

Our goal is to establish a novel MRI approach to acquire functional MRI (fMRI) data simultaneously from brain
and spinal cord. Unlike standard MRI readouts, our approach does not require a dedicated shimming procedure,
as it is based on the newly developed zero echo time MRI pulse sequence entitled Multi-Band SWeep Imaging
with Fourier Transformation (MB-SWIFT) which is inherently resilient to magnetic field inhomogeneities.
Comprehensive evaluations of the central nervous system (CNS) function will tremendously benefit from this
imaging modality, particularly in areas of research such as spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative diseases, pain
and aging. Thus far, functional neuroimaging of the CNS has been an untapped area of research due to several
technical challenges, the biggest of which is the need to efficiently shim a field of view large enough to cover
both brain and spinal cord. Solutions of per-slice dynamic shimming approaches have been proposed. However,
they are limited by the settling-time of eddy currents, they considerably prolong the experimental session, and
they have been applied only to cover cervical (but not lower) spinal cord. Furthermore, dynamic shimming allows
only inefficient sequential rather than simultaneous acquisitions of brain and spinal cord, posing additional
challenges for CNS fMRI. As proven by our preliminary data, MB-SWIFT can instead image two fields of view
(FOVs) at distant locations in brain and lumbar spinal cord in a true simultaneous fashion (i.e., within 1 ms of
each other), thus allowing unprecedented functional imaging of the CNS that is unattainable with standard
imaging modalities for fMRI. The current project is a proof-of-concept study conducted in rats, designed to first
optimize the MB-SWIFT protocol including the dual RF coil and the dual FOV acquisition, then to demonstrate
that fMRI of CNS with MB-SWIFT provides robust fMRI outcomes in absence of dedicated shimming solutions.
Moreover, we will optimize spoke order of MB-SWIFT and post-processing pipeline for handling physiological
noise, and demonstrate that MB-SWIFT provides surrogate markers of neuronal activity in spinal cord. Finally
we will establish inter-subject, intra-subject and inter-site reproducibility of task-based and resting-state fMRI
outcomes extracted from the CNS with dual FOV MB-SWIFT. Once completed, the study will provide an
invaluable tool for pre-clinical research, and will set the stage for translation to humans."

Mitigation of damage caused by total body irradiation (TBI) or partial body irradiation (PBI) requires targeting
the acute gastrointestinal syndrome. Parenteral administration of radiation mitigators for the hematopoietic
syndrome may also ameliorate the gastrointestinal syndrome; however, drug delivery to the intestinal crypts is
ineffective due to irradiation damage to the intestinal microvasculature. We have demonstrated that oral
administration of engineered Lactobacillus reuteri, which produces and releases IL-22 (LR-IL-22), ameliorates
the TBI induced acute gastrointestinal syndrome. Effective mitigation is associated with preservation of Lgr5+
intestinal crypt stem cells and their regeneration capacity. We will now establish the underlying mechanism of
radiation mitigation by LR-IL-22, and will develop a microbial therapeutic with enhanced safety and efficacy.
Preliminary data demonstrate that LR-IL-22 restores irradiation-induced suppression of gene transcription in
Lgr5+ stem cells. TBI reduces expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the intestine and its
generation of downstream products, including IL-22. We hypothesize that TBI-induced intestinal damage will
be further mitigated by combining LR-IL-22 with a probiotic (R2Ic) that naturally induces AhR to stimulate
recovery of intrinsic IL-22 levels. Furthermore, we will establish that priming the release of IL-22 by our
engineered probiotic increases therapeutic efficacy and the biological and environmental safety profiles. The
First Specific Aim tests the hypothesis that LR-IL-22 restores radiation suppressed transcription at the
molecular level in Lgr5+GFP+ intestinal stem cells. The Second Specific Aim tests the hypothesis that the
activation of AhR in irradiation weakened cells by LR-IL-22 is further boosted by oral gavage of R2Ic to induce
intrinsic IL-22 production. The Third Specific Aim addresses the need to provide biological and
environmental containment of LR-IL-22, while improving the therapeutic efficacy. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will lead to translation of LR-IL-22 to the National stockpile, as an effective mitigator of the
acute radiation induced gastrointestinal syndrome."
10821307,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) commonly detect extracellular signals to control cellular
responses. In many cases, GPCRs detect stresses that lead to activation of the cellular
recycling process called autophagy. In the yeast mating pathway, GPCRs are used to detect
and grow towards potential mating partners. The mating pathway initiates autophagy, despite
the lack of an external stress. We hypothesize that GPCR activation of autophagy represents a
novel negative feedback loop that reduces GPCR signaling through enhanced degradation of
the receptor. In Aim1 we will test the hypothesis that pheromone signaling drives selective
autophagy rather than bulk autophagy through a combination of Gα activation of PI3 Kinase and
other pheromone specific signals. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that pheromone induced
autophagy serves as a negative feedback loop to enhance receptor desensitization. These
studies will provide a molecular understanding of the interplay between GPCR signaling and
autophagy, two systems that are well conserved between yeast and humans and in which yeast
research has a long history of providing meaningful advances in the understanding of human
biology. The understanding of GPCR and autophagy interactions is important to understanding
the potential combinatorial effects of the myriad GPCR and autophagy targeting drugs currently
used to treat human disease."

Schizophrenia (Scz) is a common and debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder. However, the genetic
architecture of Scz is highly complex, impeding research progress. Recently, the Scz Exome Meta-Analysis
(SCHEMA) Consortium has identified genes with ultra-rare coding variants that each confer substantial risk for
Scz. We hypothesize that the presence of these rare variants in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)
will lead to neuronal phenotypes relevant to Scz. The PI, Dr. Pan Li, has extensive experience with gene editing
and iPSCs, including development of an improved method for seamless introduction and removal of mutations
into hiPSCs. She has previously focused on neurodegenerative disorders, but with this application proposes to
change to study of Scz. This transition is facilitated by the location of her lab in the Division of Neurobiology,
which has a long track record of research into major mental illnesses and of highly collaborative research using
iPSCs (eg the HD iPSC Consortium). In Specific Aim 1, isogenic hiPSC lines with protein truncating variants
associated with Scz will be genetically engineered by CRISPR-assisted homologous recombination to generate
panels of iPSC lines, with each isogenic line bearing a different N-terminal protein truncating point mutation.
Knockdown and overexpression rescue experiments will determine whether there is loss of protein expression
and thus loss of gene function. In Specific Aim 2, the effect of mutations on gene and protein expression will
be studied using RNA seq and quantitative proteomics. In Specific Aim 3, the effects of mutations on synaptic
and electrophysiological phenotypes will be delineated. We hypothesize that understanding the cellular
phenotypes and altered signaling pathways evoked by the SCHEMA mutations will clarify the cellular
pathogenesis of subtypes of schizophrenia, and provide potential therapeutic targets."

The Genomic Editing and Screening (GES) Core was established in 2012 with institutional funds. Initially, it
provided cutting-edge RNA interference (RNAi) gene target knockdown technologies toward the discovery of
novel cancer targets and elucidation of complex aberrant intracellular pathways. A central feature is the use of
third generation Pol II-driven, enhanced Mir30-based shRNA for high functional protein knockdown efficiency
at single-copy integration, using a diverse panel of packaged retro-and lentiviral plasmid backbones for
effective delivery. Establishment of this platform subsequently allowed for the rollout in 2014 of CRISPR-Cas9
sgRNA single-gene and full-genome knockout technologies via pooled libraries. Realization that many cell
types are easily transfectable and that discrete intracellular events such as activation, translocation, and cell-
to-cell communication can be quantified using high-speed automated fluorescence microscopy, the Core
initiated high content imaging and analysis (HCA) for arrayed siRNA experimentation. A natural extension of
this 96/384 well plate format was then evolved into a workstation-based small molecule compound screening
program, allowing investigators to effectively phenocopy newly-identified targets using chemical biology
approaches. The most promising of these compounds are then matriculated into the Early Therapeutics Center
(ETC) and Tri-Institutional Therapeutic Drug Initiative (TRI-I TDI). Overall, this multi-modal Core enables
mechanism-based science through target identification and drug screening, offering custom reagents and
services to a growing number of the Center’s members."

Eleutherobin (1) is a diterpenoid marine natural product (MNP) isolated from octocorals. As a potent
microtubule stabilizing agent, 1 shows growth inhibition toward cancer cell lines with potency comparable to
paclitaxel but with reduced cross-resistance toward β-tubulin mutants. Currently, a sustainable supply of 1 has
not been accessed through wild harvest, aquaculture or total synthesis. A synthetic biology approach toward 1
has been considered as a possible alternative, but the native pathway remains elusive. Thus, the biosynthesis
of 1 provides a challenging research opportunity in need of novel and creative ideas. Recently, our group has
reported the characterization of a key terpene cyclase, EcTPS1, from a producer of 1, E. caribaeorum.
Furthermore, the EcTPS1 gene was found to be flanked by predicted oxidase and acylase genes on an animal
chromosome. This unprecedented, putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) provides a clear direction for
reconstituting biosynthesis of 1. Our underlying hypothesis is that by using our characterized EcTPS1 as
a starting point we can produce 1 using a combination of chemical and enzymological methods. The
overall goal of this proposal will be to engineer heterologous production of precursors to 1, characterize the
tailoring enzymes in the BGC and employ these in a semi-synthesis of 1. This work will provide innovation in
the field biochemistry by further developing tools in secondary metabolism as well as affording commodities in
the form of sustainable natural product supply and novel biocatalysts. Three essential challenges toward these
efforts are: 1) No synthetic biology route or other sustainable approach to a eunicellane precursor exists; 2)
Installation of oxygenated functional groups by chemical synthetic means will require stereo-, regio- and
chemoselective methods. 3) The tailoring enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway are biochemically challenging
membrane bound proteins. These challenges will be addressed using organic synthesis and synthetic biology
as outlined in the following specific aims: Aim 1) Engineering a semi-synthetic route toward eleutherobin;
Subaim 1a) Synthetic biology route to the eunicellane precursor klysimplexin R; Subaim 1b) Chemical
synthesis of the eleutherobin core: Aim 2) Characterization of tailoring enzymes in the eleutherobin
biosynthetic pathway; Subaim 2a) Characterization of cytochrome P450 enzymes; Subaim 2b)
Characterization of acyl transferase enzymes. This work will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Eric
Schmidt, a renowned natural products biochemist, and will provide an excellent training and career
development opportunity for me to become a successful, independent academic scientist focusing on
biomedically relevant areas. In addition to my primary mentor Dr. Schmidt, a committee of three prominent
scientists, Drs. Bradley Moore, Vinayak Agarwal and Jeffrey Rudolf, have agreed to mentor me and will
provide a means of evaluation and support in my effort toward these aims."

This proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide Hyun Kim,
PhD, a post-doctoral fellow at Columbia University, with research training and career development that will
help her become an independent and expert sleep scientist in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) research. Poor or fragmented sleep increases the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's
disease (AD) through accumulation of amyloid-β, spread of tau, and accelerated microglial activation. While
sleep's connection to brain and cognitive function is widely established, it is unclear whether modifying sleep in
older adults could delay cognitive decline and slow the development of AD. Understanding the impact of sleep
treatments on cognitive changes could enhance the current understanding of sleep disturbance as a modifiable
risk factor and establish sleep interventions as a potential tool to reduce AD risks. The primary aim of the
proposed research project is to examine neurocognitive performance outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia (CBTI) and acoustic slow wave activity enhancement (SWAE). The mechanism of treatment-related
neurocognitive changes will be investigated using the changes in objective and subjective sleep
parameters. The secondary aim is to examine the impact of sleep treatments on cognitively-mediated everyday
functioning. The exploratory aim is to assess whether CBTI and/or SWAE are associated with plasma AD
biomarker, namely phosphorylated tau. These research aims will be complemented by career development
plans involving (1) enhancing scientific knowledge in sleep and AD neurobiology; (2) developing skills in
clinical trial methodology and relevant analytic skills; (3) fostering professional development and networking in
sleep and AD scientific community. Collectively, the proposed study, in its research question, scope, and
structure, is designed to serve as a road map for future R01 studies that investigate the intricate relationship
between sleep and ADRD."

Molecular Biology Across Scales (MBAS) is a new multidisciplinary predoctoral training program that will
develop the next generation of researchers discovering how molecules, cells, and tissues interact to create life
and how this information can advance human health. MBAS will be the only graduate program at the University
of California, Berkeley that supports broad-based training in multiple disciplines of molecular biology, rather than
specialization within a particular discipline. This perspective has driven many of the transformative biological
discoveries of recent years, including several made by MBAS faculty. MBAS will draw its students and faculty
from the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology (MCB) Graduate Program, uniting those who tackle
fundamental research problems at length scales ranging from individual molecules to complex biochemical
systems to whole organisms. It will appoint 40 students (20 first-year trainees annually for a two-year term) with
a target of 30% from historically excluded groups in the biological sciences. MBAS will provide diverse training
opportunities for its diverse student body, encouraging each trainee to explore a wide range of research fields in
their early years and identify those that most fully engage their individual passion. MBAS students will be required
to publish a first-author paper and graduate with a mean time to degree of 5.5 years. The curriculum will impart
broad conceptual knowledge, creative and critical thinking, mastery of experimental logic and methods,
application of computational and quantitative approaches, rigorous analysis and interpretation of results, clear
and fluent communication of findings, and incorporation of responsible, safe, and ethical practices. Students will
choose formally-trained mentors from a faculty of 75 nationally recognized leaders who represent a wide choice
of research areas and technical approaches, use state-of-the-art facilities, and work in an interactive, diverse
and collaborative environment. MBAS will provide training, oversight, and support for its participating faculty, and
will carefully monitor the progress of its trainees. Students will be well-supported with inclusive learning
communities, rigorous and clear expectations, expert advising, and a program design that accounts for
differences in preparation. Innovative training elements include new courses and enhanced content in
responsible conduct of research and reproducibility, quantitative biology and data science, lab safety, and
scientific writing. To further strengthen recruitment and retention, MBAS will mount initiatives to bolster diversity,
equity, inclusion, and belonging. New programs will be piloted and evaluated with the goal of scaling the most
successful of them to benefit all trainees within MCB. Professional skills development, experiential learning
opportunities, and career counseling will prepare trainees for research-related careers of their choosing in
academia, industry, government, non-governmental organizations, and beyond. In sum, MBAS will provide an
early and persistent emphasis on multidisciplinary training, centered around the student experience, for a flexible
and individually directed path to a successful career in the biomedical workforce."

We have one specific aim: Train postdoctoral fellows who will be qualified and well-positioned to
become leaders in the development and implementation of substance use research in tobacco control,
public health, policy, and clinical practice. Specifically, we propose a postdoctoral fellowship program that will
attract individuals with a strong commitment to transdisciplinary research from a variety of medical, biological,
social, behavioral, and policy sciences to help build the next generation of scientific leaders in tobacco control
and related substance use. Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death the U.S. and
disproportionately burdens people with substance use disorders.
The need for tobacco control expertise continues to grow with demand for research to inform FDA
regulation of tobacco products, the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control, and state and local tobacco control efforts to address the rapidly evolving tobacco product
environment. Considering the high rates of tobacco co-use with other substances, our program is expanding
on points of synergy between tobacco, cannabis and opioid research. This includes training in: 1) Research on
tobacco and cannabis co-use and cannabis health effects to inform policy and develop evidence-based
interventions and 2) Research on industry behavior that has driven both the tobacco and opioid epidemics and
is likely to become increasingly important with cannabis legalization. We provide this training through
integrated transdisciplinary coursework in tobacco science, tobacco policy, addiction, and biostatistics,
combined with mentored research with two faculty from different disciplines. Fellows complete a course in
which they prepare, and submit grant proposals to funding agencies for their third year of fellowship funding.
Research mentors include 31 faculty members from all four schools at UCSF (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing,
and Pharmacy) with active research programs in tobacco policy, marketing, addiction, health effects of
smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, emerging tobacco, cannabis and vaping products, cessation,
cannabis substitution for opioids, and analyses of tobacco and opioid industry documents. The diverse fellow
backgrounds and interests in the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education provides a cooperative
environment that creates continuous opportunities to learn from and appreciate work in other disciplines. Each
fellow creates an Individual Development Plan that is reviewed by both mentors and the Fellowship
Committee. The Committee selects fellows from a competitive national pool: we average 29 applications per
year for 3 slots. Between 2016-2021, our fellows produced 135 papers in 68 different journals. Since 2001, we
have trained 92 fellows (62 funded by NIH training grants since 2006); 93% of our R25/T32 graduates have
research careers in academic, government and nongovernmental institutions, and 54% are academic faculty."

This application requests continued funding, at the present level of eight training positions, for the post-
doctoral T32 program, “Training in Arteriosclerosis Research” that began in 1978 and was last renewed on
August 1, 2018. The goal of this program is to provide basic and clinical investigators with broadly based
knowledge in scientific fields related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which has a major impact on
the health of the American population. This training program is, therefore, very relevant to the mission of
NHLBI. This T32 functions within a broad framework of research addressing various aspects of
cardiovascular disease and the spectrum of biologic and social determinants, including diabetes, obesity,
dyslipidemia, hypertension, sleep disorders, and health disparities that increase the risk for atherosclerosis. A
major strength of the program is the many collaborations that exist between faculty mentors. The training
program has a long record of success, with over 75% of trainees that completed the program presently in
research positions, mostly in academic centers and funded by NIH and foundations. The faculty is anchored
by a group of outstanding Senior Mentors, who in addition to mentoring postdoctoral trainees working in
their laboratories will act as mentors for other trainees and junior faculty members in the program. Many of
the Senior Mentors have worked together in this program for more than 15 years, and to ensure the
continued success of the program in these challenging times, we have recruited a new group of younger and
significantly more diverse faculty, both at the Senior and Junior Co-Mentor levels, to join them. Importantly,
20% of the new faculty are underrepresented minorities and 40% are women. Dr. Henry Ginsberg, PI of this
program for 20 years, joins with Drs. Muredach Reilly (PI of Columbia's CTSA) and Jacquelyn Taylor
(Director of the Center for Research in People of Color in the School of Nursing) in a 3 MPI model that will
allow them to meet the many challenges facing sciences and healthcare. Associate Directors, the
Executive Committee, and several subcommittees, will assist the MPI's. In addition to one meeting each
month where trainees present their research, a second monthly meeting will focus on rigor and
reproducibility, health disparities, and the impact or gender or racial bias on research outcomes. All trainees
will enroll in didactic programs to strengthen their knowledge in biostatistics and translational/clinical
research, as well as Precision Medicine and Health Disparities, two new areas that will be highlighted.
Mentoring, particularly of women and minority trainees, will be a major focus of the program. The program will
continue to recruit Ph.D.'s, M.D.'s. and others with professional degrees, with new opportunities for graduates
of Columbia's Ph.D. programs in Nursing and Social Work. New collaborations with outside universities will
increase our ability to recruit scientists from underrepresented minorities. All these changes will begin in year
45, the last year of the present funding cycle."

The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) Medical Scientist/Engineer Training Program (MSTP) has
trained a diverse cohort of physician-scientists/engineers to conduct rigorous, innovative and clinically relevant
research. Graduates are leaders in the biomedical sciences who are applying the rapid advances in scientific
discovery to the development of new treatments for human disease. We aim to partner with NIGMS to support
this program, requesting that 25% of our cohort be trainees on the T32 grant. Our Specific Aims are 1) to recruit
a competitive cohort from diverse backgrounds who have a strong commitment both to research and to patient
care; 2) to train students in basic and translational research and in medicine, thus equipping graduates to
succeed; and 3) to graduate students with MD and PhD degrees who are competitive for the best residency
positions; and who will become leading, innovative physician-scientists/physician-engineers in academics and
industry. A unique aspect of our MSTP is its long-standing partnership and synergy with the Weldon School of
Biomedical Engineering (BME) at Purdue University; the program has already graduated 20 physician-engineers.
A second key feature is our focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In this regard, our many active
recruitment and feeder programs, including one supported by a new Burroughs-Wellcome Fund grant, have
made us leaders in DEI recruitment, particularly in the Midwest. In the last five years 22% of our matriculants
have come from underrepresented and/or disadvantaged groups, and 50% have been women. We have 108
preceptors with strong training and research records and ~$130 million in grant support. The program’s
excellence is reflected in the increase in applications, from 99 in 2007 to 293 in 2021. The MSTP is the top
training priority for IUSM, funded with $2 million in direct support and several MSTP-specific endowments,
including $10 million from the Eli Lilly Foundation. Our program equips students to excel by providing superior
programmatic structure, curricular content, mentorship, research facilities and clinical resources. IUSM is
Indiana’s only allopathic medical school: it is the largest medical school in the nation, with one of the largest
health systems. Our leaders prioritize student welfare, DEI training and safety. Training is required in the
responsible conduct of research and in research reproducibility and all graduates have published first author
papers. In the last five years, 100% of our graduates matched into top-ranked residency programs across the
nation, including research-intensive residencies (e.g., PSTPs). Long term, graduates are successful in
academics and in industry. Here, we propose to partner with NIH to train the next generation of exceptional
physician-scientists and physician-engineers in Indiana."
10831382,"NEUROBIOLOGY OF DRUG ABUSE TRAINING PROGRAM SUMMARY
One of the keys to developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for substance use disorder is
understanding the neurobiological consequences of chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. Such studies must
involve multi-disciplinary approaches to examine several different levels of brain function. This is the goal of
our current training program, the Neurobiology of Drug Abuse Training Program, which proposes to continue a
successful tradition of NIDA training at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM). This program requests
funding to train five predoctoral students in a multi-disciplinary program in the neurobiology of drug abuse. The
program includes 24 faculty members at WFSM, with research interests spanning molecular biology, receptor
pharmacology, brain imaging techniques in humans and non-human primates, electrophysiology, neuronal
activity monitoring and behavioral analysis of drug self- administration. The research of the faculty is
supported by a significant number of federally-funded grants related to the field of substance abuse. The
training program is organized around three principal areas of research: Molecular/Cellular Neurobiology,
Neurobiological Systems, and Behavioral Neurobiology. The training program offers a specific course in drug
abuse covering topics related to each of these three areas. Predoctoral students have a choice of two different
Ph.D. degree tracks: Integrated Physiology/Pharmacology and Neuroscience. Although these programs have
their own individual requirements, specific drug abuse-related topics are integrated into the standard
programs. The training program offers specific seminars and journal clubs for trainees and opportunities for
additional substance abuse training. The program also contains specialized components dealing with
statistics/data analytics, grant writing, rigor and transparency in research, and ethics in scientific research.
Recruitment of students will be aided by the fact that the field of neuroscience is one of the fastest growing
disciplines in the biological sciences, and WFSM is undergoing a strong research growth phase. In addition,
recruitment of applicants from under- represented minorities will be a high priority, including undergraduate
training programs with Winston Salem State University, North Carolina A&T University and North Carolina
Central University. In summary, the Neurobiology of Drug Abuse Training Program not only offers students
outstanding opportunities for education and research in the neurobiology of drug abuse but is also a valuable
resource for the field of drug abuse by providing trained young investigators capable of independent scientific
careers."

Genetic study of orofacial clefts (OFC) is foundational to genetics of congenital structural
birth defects. Most OFC cases are non-syndromic and involve complex genetic
mechanisms that are yet to be fully elucidated. Currently, genetic diagnosis for cleft
anomalies is hampered by two critical knowledge gaps. First, genes essential for
palate formation are incompletely identified. Second, even when the cleft risk genes are
associated, algorithms used to impute deleterious from benign gene variants via
computational and statistical methods remain unreliable. There is a critical need to
translate genome sequencing to clinically actionable data, where functional studies
provide the highest-level evidence to impute pathogenicity. We showed that Esrp1 and
its paralog Esrp2 (hereafter Esrp1/2) operate in the periderm of mouse and zebrafish to
regulate craniofacial development. Esrp1/2 mediates alternative splicing of RNA
transcripts, creating epithelial isoforms that function in oral epithelium and periderm. This
proposal tests the central hypothesis that Esrp1/2 is required to generate epithelial
isoform of Ctnnd1, which maintains periderm integrity necessary for craniofacial
morphogenesis.
 We will impute pathogenicity of ESRP1/2 and CTNND1 human gene variants
associated with OFC. Using completed genome sequencing projects and projects in
progress, we curate large numbers of ESRP1, ESRP2 and CTNND1 gene variants to
ascertain their function. We employ complementary in vivo zebrafish esrp1/2 mutant
assay and in vitro Esrp1/2 murine Py2T cell lines to optimize rigor of approach. We
will also discover and functionally validate Esrp-regulated genes, using zebrafish
epithelial transgenic reporter lines. We discovered that Esrp1/2 regulates alternative
splicing of CTNND1 and will functionally interrogate human CTNND1 gene variants in
the zebrafish ctnnd1 mutant in a rescue assay.
 The expected outcome of this project is to gain mechanistic insights by
leveraging genome sequencing data associated with orofacial cleft cohorts, to
functionally analyze ESRP1/2 and CTNND1 gene variants in craniofacial development.
We will also identify and functionally validate Esrp-regulated genes acting in the
periderm. This work will have broader impact by elucidating how regulation of RNA
alternative splicing and cell signaling mechanisms are important in periderm and
craniofacial morphogenesis."

This proposal aims to substantially advance two frontier research areas, Molecular Prosthetics and Automated
Small Molecule Synthesis, and thereby have a major impact on human health. The first half targets the
development of a new class of molecular prosthetics that replace missing biochemical reactions. Our lab has
recently demonstrated in animals and in people that small molecules can replace the function of deficient proteins,
thus operating as prostheses on the molecular scale. We further illuminated specific mechanisms that permit
imperfect functional mimicry to be sufficient for substantial physiology restoration due to the inherent robustness
of living systems. In this proposal we will launch a new research direction to find small molecules that replace
deficient enzymes. There are more than 100 human diseases linked to loss of enzyme function, and we will
specifically target three examples: Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency, Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency,
and Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1. These diseases have two features in common that we propose render them
susceptible to this approach: 1) a high concentration of the substrate for the missing enzyme, or an upstream
precursor, builds up in the blood and/or tissues, and 2) the corresponding substrate has unique chemical
reactivity. We hypothesize that these two features will permit imperfect small molecule reagents to serve as
effective functional surrogates for missing enzymes in human blood plasma and in mouse models. The second
half targets new molecular lego kits for automated synthesis of two functionally-rich classes of natural products:
lipids and polycyclic terpenoids. Both classes perform many biological and industrial functions, yet remain
inherently challenging to synthesize. Building on our recent development of a fully automated lego-like platform
for small molecule synthesis, we plan to create a lego kits for on-demand preparation of both classes of
compounds. Parallel retrosynthetic analysis showed that preparation of ~130 known polyunsaturated fatty acids
requires only 26 building blocks, which we will prepare. We will also develop two new Csp3-C bond forming
methods to iteratively assemble building blocks, and a Nextgen synthesis machine to render this process fully
automated. We will apply this platform to better understand molecular prosthetic ion channels. We also plan to
combine modular lego-like construction of linear molecules with cyclization-promoting self-assembled
resorcinarene capsules to create a highly efficient and flexible lego kit for polycyclic terpenoids. To this end, we
will define new structure-cyclization relationships, characterize their underpinnings, and leverage them to achieve
efficient syntheses of complex polycyclic terpenoid natural products. Collectively these studies will push the
frontiers of chemical biology and organic synthesis and open new frontiers for medicine."

Recent evidence suggests that environmental factors causing somatic mutations during the lifetime have a
more crucial role, not only in cancer but also in other common diseases, including heart failure. Recent studies
have also shown that somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNV) accumulate even in nondividing cells, such as
neurons in the human cortex, resulting in thousands of sSNV per neuronal genome by old age. However,
genomic DNA changes in aging cardiomyocytes (CM) remain poorly understood. The accumulation of somatic
DNA mutations over time has recently been demonstrated to be a hallmark of aging in many human cell types.
The current study aims to determine the landscape and role of somatic mutations in aging and cardiac disease
by adopting a new technique that allow deep whole-genome sequencing of DNA isolated from single CM taken
from the frozen postmortem heart. The first Aim of this study is to evaluate the somatic mutational burden
(sSNVs) in aging CM genome. We will also compare CM mutational burden with postmitotic cells from another
organ (neurons) to define differences in accumulation rate during aging. In the second Aim, we will ask what
are the mutational signature and the mechanisms of mutation formation in the aging human heart and if the
heart mutational signature is different than the brain mutational signature. Further to recapitulate the mutational
signature and related phenotype in the heart we will directly induce oxidative stress in an in vitro culture model
of primary CMs. The final Aim will focus on evaluating the genotoxic effect of radiation in CMs after childhood
radiation therapy and the role of radiation in premature aging. The proposed research is significant for the
comprehensive, results-based development of strategies for understanding natural aging and disease
progression in the human heart. Together with the planned characterization of mutational signatures, the
anticipated results may provide knowledge to develop new strategies for preventing the heart disease
associated with aging. The proposed study is only possible because of a series of innovations that are, at this
time, uniquely available to our research team, 1) a novel method to isolate single CM nuclei from frozen
myocardium based on CM ploidy and nuclei cardiac troponin T expression. 2) A major breakthrough by
developing “LiRA” and “PhaseDel” algorithm to call sSNV and sSV confidently from tetraploid cells that
considers cell-specific depth distributions of DNA sequencing and allele-dropout rates in scWGS data. For the
first time, our study will reveal the landscape of somatic mutations, genomic changes during aging and after
radiation therapy in human heart muscle cells in a single-cell resolution. In the long term, this study will
provide insights that might allow blocking some of the mutational processes ameliorating age-related
myocardial dysfunction."

It is critical to understand risk and protective factors for health to optimize developmental outcomes and inform
prevention of poor health behaviors across the lifespan. Research using longitudinal designs, multiple levels of
analysis, and experimental clinical trials are needed. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
death worldwide. The origins of adult CVD begin prenatally: High prenatal maternal depressive symptoms
robustly predict offspring CVD risk. However, knowledge on risk and protective factors for CVD for offspring of
mothers with high depressive symptoms has been correlational. There is a lack of experimental work using a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to understand potential mechanisms that contribute to children's CVD
risk following exposure to high maternal prenatal depressive symptoms across multiple levels (e.g., maternal
and child behaviors, physiology) over time. Although efficacious interventions to diminish depressive symptoms
among pregnant women exist, research has not investigated whether reducing prenatal maternal depressive
symptoms can reduce offspring cardiovascular risk. The current study proposes to leverage a RCT of an
effective psychosocial intervention for prenatal maternal depression to test whether reducing prenatal maternal
depressive symptoms improves offspring cardiovascular health at ages 3-4 years. We hypothesize that the
prenatal intervention operates by reducing both prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms to improve child
outcomes. This study will identify intervention targets for offspring of mothers with high prenatal depressive
symptoms to reduce cardiovascular risk. These goals will be accomplished by building on a RCT
(R01MH109662) of an established psychosocial intervention that effectively reduces maternal prenatal
depressive symptoms. We propose to leverage this unique opportunity to follow up mothers and children who
participated in this RCT to test whether this intervention improves offspring cardiovascular health. This project
increases rigor of the existing correlational research by using an experimental RCT design. The following 3
aims will be addressed. Aim 1: To test whether reducing prenatal maternal depressive symptoms improves the
quality of food the mother feeds her child, maternal feeding behaviors, and modeling of eating behaviors at 3
years. Aim 2: To test whether reducing prenatal maternal depressive symptoms improves child diet, eating
behaviors, sleep, and physical activity at 3 years. Aim 3: To test whether reducing prenatal maternal
depressive symptoms reduces child CVD risk at 3 and 4 years, including BMI, waist circumference, body fat,
blood pressure, and arterial stiffness. This project will provide the strongest evidence to date for a mechanistic
model of prenatal maternal depressive symptoms' influence on child cardiovascular health. Importantly, the
project will also provide evidence for whether effective psychosocial interventions to reduce prenatal maternal
depressive symptoms should be used to reduce the burden of CVD in the next generation."

biomedical research training program, focused on individuals from minority and historically underrepresented
groups who intend to enter a Ph.D. program. Based on a series of defined objectives we will: recruit well-
qualified under-represented scholars to our program; create and realize individualized development plans to
provide laboratory research experience and tailored skills for academic, professional, and personal growth;
provide support for successful application of scholars to Ph.D. programs and careers in the biomedical
research workforce; and investigate the parameters impacting graduate school retention and utilize these data
to improve graduate training at UNM. We anticipate that this training will notably increase the number of well-

10757705,"The Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh (UPitt) is seeking continued support for a
predoctoral training program (8 positions/year) aimed at educating talented students from engineering and
other quantitative sciences for careers in biomedical research in the cardiovascular area. UPitt has been at
the forefront of education and research in this field, with two key components contributing to this status.
First, a mechanism is in place whereby our students are exposed first-hand to clinical problems requiring
bioengineering input for their solution within various medical disciplines. Second, there continues to be a
significant Institutional commitment to these research and educational endeavors. The proposed program is
interdisciplinary in nature. Although the Program is housed in the Department of Bioengineering, the training
faculty is drawn from several departments: Anesthesiology, Bioengineering, Chemical & Mechanical
Engineering, Critical Care Medicine, Developmental Biology, Medicine, Pathology, Pharmacology, and
Surgery. The participating faculty members are (bio)engineers, physiologists/biophysicists, cell/molecular
and systems/synthetic biologists, cardiologists, pathologists, and pulmonologists, with vigorous and well-
funded research programs. There are three focus areas of this Program: (1) Basic understanding and
quantitative characterization of native (normal and pathological conditions) and perturbed (i.e., with
deployment of man-made devices or constructs) cardiovascular function at various levels of organization
(molecules-to-whole organ/organism), (2) Imaging for functional assessment at various levels of
organization (molecules-to-whole organ/organism), and (3) Design and optimization of artificial devices and
constructs (mechanical, tissue-engineered, and hybrid). The current proposal includes additional focus on
systems/synthetic biology and a continued emphasis on biomedical innovation and entrepreneurship, which
is consistent with the significant translational research performed by the Program faculty and trainees.
Although most Program trainees have (bio)engineering background, some come from other disciplines
(e.g., biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics). Program coursework (10 didactic courses + workshops) is
designed to provide both breadth and depth in engineering and biological sciences and includes a formal
exposure to biostatistics, bioethics, and professional and career development issues. A novel aspect of the
Program is that students are required to formally participate in a clinical experience (Clinical Internship and
Rotation). Thus, the training program provides a unique educational and research experience with respect
to basic and applied cardiovascular engineering and sciences. Finally, each student receives extensive
research training in the laboratories of the training faculty. Thirty-one predoctoral trainees have participated
in the Program during the current funding cycle (September 1, 2017 – June 30, 2022) and we believe that
the trainee performance and program outcomes have been outstanding (see Progress Report)."
10824225,"Project Summary/Abstract
The urgent need to refill the physician-scientist pipeline by training the next generation of physicians in basic and
translational laboratory and applied clinical research has been widely recognized. A declining number of
surgeon-scientists, however, threatens future advancement of surgical practice. The overall goal of this training
program is to train the next generation of surgeon-scientists, who have the knowledge, skillsets and motivation
to perform translationally relevant and meaningful research that will lead to significant improvements in patient
outcomes. Our training program seeks applications from surgery residents interested in a 2-year full-time
research training centered on injury pathobiology and outcomes in critical illness, a broad research arena
essential for all surgical specialties. Each year, 1 trainee, who has typically completed 3 years of surgery
residency, will be recruited primarily from a large pool of diverse and highly talented applicants for the general
surgery and the integrated vascular surgery residency programs in the Department of Surgery, Morsani College
of Medicine at University of South Florida (USF). The central hub of our training program is the Division of
Surgical Research (DSR) in the DOS. Experienced investigators in the DSR, alongside carefully selected
investigators from 5 other USF departments will form the training faculty. The training faculty is composed of 14
individuals who are committed to the research training of young surgeons, have an establish track record of
extramural funding related to various aspects of injury pathobiology and outcomes in critical illness, and currently
hold more than 30 NIH/VA awards as principal investigators. Many of our training faculty are physician scientists,
which provides our trainees with critical experience and knowledge in both medical and basic sciences. Based
on the experience of the MPI/PDs as PIs of previous T32 training programs at other institutions, we propose an
optimized training plan to provide trainees with intensive state-of-the-art training in responsible conduct of
rigorous and reproducible research that is guided by individual development plans. While trainees will select a
scientific mentor of their choice, all trainees will be required to develop written research proposals and progress
reports, to give formal research presentations, to participate in seminars, journal clubs and in didactic course
work in biomedical data analysis and responsible conduct of research. In addition, trainees will have the
opportunity to obtain additional graduate degrees/certifications in health informatics or health care analytics. We
have the infrastructure, resources, expertise and motivation to provide our trainees with advanced and
individualized research training in a vibrant scientific environment. We believe that our training program will
ultimately provide the society with much needed surgeon-scientists, who will be at the forefront of clinical practice
in the future."
10754243,"Dysfunction in mechanisms that regulate the development, maintenance, and plasticity of synaptic connections
have been linked to many neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, and thus a deep molecular understanding of these processes will be crucial in relieving the severe health burden these disorders impose.
One aspect of synaptic communication that is critical for information processing in the brain is the maintenance
of precise functional alignment between presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic function at individual synapses, but the local signals that control this aspect of “synaptic homeostasis” are poorly understood.
This project will focus on a recently discovered homeostatic pathway in hippocampal neurons that functions to
tune presynaptic neurotransmitter release when postsynaptic receptor activation is deficient. My laboratory
has recently described a unique homeostatic signaling pathway that couples synaptic inactivity to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in postsynaptic dendrites. mTORC1 activation, in turn, drives the local dendritic
translation and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which elicits compensatory increases in
neurotransmitter release from apposed presynaptic terminals but only if those terminals have been recently
active. This state-dependent gating of synaptic homeostasis by local presynaptic activity ensures coupling of
mTORC1 trans-synaptic signaling to spike-driven neurotransmitter release. During the previous period of support, we discovered that BDNF elicits presynaptic compensation via the proteasome-dependent degradation of
the synaptic regulator tomosyn1 (Tomo1), which is catalyzed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1. During these
investigations, we uncovered an unexpected and critical role for activity-dependent recruitment of the proteasome to axonal boutons. We now propose to test the central hypothesis that activity-dependent sequestration of proteasomes in presynaptic terminals confers state-dependent gating of synaptic homeostasis driven by
postsynaptic mTORC1 signaling. Our investigations will examine how regulated phosphorylation of the 19S
proteasome subunit Rpt6 dynamically regulates proteasome distribution in axons (Aim 1), define the core signaling pathway in axon terminals that links neural activity (and specifically, P/Q/N voltage-gated Ca2+ channel
activity) with posttranslational modifications of the proteasome important for synaptic targeting (Aim 2), and
define the molecular mechanisms that control proteasome sequestration in axon terminals (Aim 3). In each of
these aims, the relationship of the mechanisms uncovered with mTORC1 trans-synaptic homeostatic signaling
will be rigorously tested. The proposed experiments employ state of the art optical imaging of synaptic vesicle
cycling and release, genetic models targeting mTORC1 signaling and proteasome phosphorylation, rigorous
electrophysiological measurements, and are focused on a fundamentally new area of synaptic biology. The
findings are expected to significantly advance our understanding of local homeostatic mechanisms that act to
coordinate postsynaptic activity with spatial and temporal adjustments in presynaptic neurotransmitter release."

degradation pathway that is active in all human cells, and inhibiting autophagy shows promise as a therapy for
late-stage cancers especially in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapies. Autophagy research and
drug development currently rely on compounds that inhibit autophagy indirectly. Better, more specific inhibitors
of autophagy would be broadly adopted. A large amount of genetics and cell biology work supports that
inhibiting the LC3/GABARAP family of proteins can block autophagy selectively. In one series of projects, we
will develop novel stapled peptide and small molecule inhibitors of LC3/GABARAP and evaluate them in
models of late-stage cancers and other diseases.
Because of our expertise in compounds that bind LC3/GABARAP proteins, we also propose to evaluate related
compounds as autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs). These compounds could be used to selectively
degrade any proteins in the cell, similar to proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) but potentially more
versatile and easier to develop. Based on strong preliminary data that validate the AUTAC concept, we will
develop novel AUTACs and demonstrate their ability to degrade endogenous proteins, unlocking a
broad new area for drug development in targeted protein degradation.
Over the course of developing stapled peptides as autophagy modulators, the Kritzer lab encountered a
common problem in the field: how to measure the amount that actually reaches the cytosol. In an
independent series of projects, the Kritzer lab has developed novel assays that quantitate the cytosolic
penetration of large-molecule therapeutics. In this proposal, we describe new opportunities to address
challenging problems in drug development for large-molecule therapeutics. We describe new methods to
measure penetration to different cellular compartments in any cell type, including primary cells. We also
describe a molecular evolution approach to develop a new “turn-on” assay that measures the real-time
kinetics of cytosolic penetration. We describe pooled CRISPR screens to reveal the cellular components
that mediate endosomal escape. Finally, we describe a novel screening platform that will allow us to screen
thousands to millions of molecules at a time for those that are most cell-penetrant; the new screen will be
incorporated into a design-test-learn cycle to produce data-driven design algorithms for cytosol-penetrant

10782979,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the proposed study is to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying FOXF1-mediated
temporal and spatial coordination of multiple alveolar endothelial and epithelial cell subtypes. FOXF1 (Forkhead
Box F1) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in lung vascular development, homeostasis, and repair
after injury. Heterozygous deletions or point mutations in FOXF1 are associated with alveolar-capillary dysplasia
with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV), a lethal lung developmental disorder with no cure. Although
the Foxf1 mutant mouse model has been created to study ACD, there are certain variations in gene signatures
of EC subtypes and developmental timing of the alveolarization in mouse vs. human, limiting its application in
understanding ACD human etiology. Thus, it remains unclear how FOXF1 regulates downstream gene networks
to drive the formation of alveolar endothelial cell (EC) subtypes and maintain normal EC-epithelial cell (EpiC)
crosstalk during alveologenesis in human. Our preliminary studies showed that FOXF1 mutations lead to distinct
cell population and transcriptomic changes in two newly identified alveolar EC subtypes- aerocyte (aCap) and
general capillary (gCap), based on single nuclei RNA-sequencing in control and ACD human lung tissues. More
interestingly, although FOXF1 does not express in epithelial lineage, alveolar type 1 (AT1) EpiC population was
significantly reduced, and damage-associated transient epithelial progenitors (DATPs) were increased in FOXF1
mutant human lung. Ligand-receptor binding analysis revealed disrupted TGFβ signaling in aCap (TGFB2)-AT1
(TGFBR2/3) interaction. Therefore, we hypothesized that FOXF1 regulates distinct pathways in aCap and gCap
cells, and FOXF1-dependent TGFβ2 secretion by aCap is critical in maintaining AT1 identity and function. We
propose to test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of FOXF1 in regulating
differentiation and function of alveolar EC subtypes. Aim 2: Determine the impact of aCap cells on maintaining
AT1 identity and function. Aim 3: Uncover FOXF1 mediated early lung development using iPSC derived organoid
systems. For Aim 3, we established 3D vascularized alveolar organoid models from control and ACD induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to study FOXF1 gene regulation and dynamic EC-EpiC interactions across
multiple lung developmental stages. Completion of the three aims will provide granular mechanistic insights into
the spatial and temporal patterning of intercellular signaling pathways driven by FOXF1 in human lung
alveologenesis, and provide new therapeutic targets to re-establish normal alveolar-capillary interface in various
lung developmental disorders."
10746807,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A longstanding question in developmental biology is how stem cells commit to a certain lineage. While cell
surface markers correlate with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions, less is known regarding transcriptional
regulators that drive stem cell behavior. CUX1 encodes a highly conserved homeodomain-containing
transcription factor. Deletions and inactivating mutations of CUX1 are recurrent in clonal hematopoiesis of
indeterminate potential and myelodysplastic syndrome, and CUX1 loss is associated with cytopenias, lineage
skewing, and a poor-prognosis in disease states. Typically, only one copy of CUX1 is inactivated, indicating
that loss of CUX1 impacts hematopoietic development in a haploinsufficient manner. In line with this, we
previously reported a dosage-dependent role for CUX1 in hematopoiesis. How CUX1 levels regulate
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fate, with respect to proliferation, self-renewal, and lineage
choice remains a major gap in knowledge. The overall objective of the current proposal is to determine the
molecular mechanism by which CUX1 dosage regulates HSPC fate. To address this, we have now generated
a novel CUX1-reporter mouse to measure CUX1 protein levels at the single-cell level during development. In
preliminary data, we demonstrate that CUX1 is expressed highly in HSPCs while exhibiting heterogeneity
within stem and progenitor compartments. We show that CUX1 levels correlate with hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) activity, with CUX1dim HSCs demonstrating higher multilineage, long-term hematopoiesis compared to
CUX1bright HSCs. We show that CUX1 interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to regulate
chromatin accessibility in primary human HSPCs. Thus, our central hypothesis is that CUX1 regulates HSC
fate via dosage-dependent opening of lineage-specific enhancers through recruitment of SWI/SNF. We test
this hypothesis with two Specific Aims. Aim 1: Overall hypothesis – CUX1 upregulation is necessary for HSC
differentiation. In a series of in vivo experiments in mice and complementary assays with primary human cells,
we will correlate CUX1 protein levels with HSC functions, including proliferation, self-renewal, and
differentiation. We will perturb CUX1 levels to assess how CUX1 dosage impacts these functions. Aim 2:
Overall hypothesis – CUX1 upregulation drives enhancer priming for differentiation. To determine how CUX1
impacts chromatin remodeling and enhancer activation, we will leverage cutting-edge functional genomics
approaches and single-cell methodologies in HSCs using our CUX1-reporter and CUX1-knockdown mice and
primary human HSPCs. Accomplishing the proposed studies will elucidate the critical epigenetic role for
dosage-sensitive CUX1 transcriptional regulation in hematopoietic development. This work is critical to
achieve our long-term goal of identifying therapeutic interventions for patients with CUX1 haploinsufficiency."

10765694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a recalcitrant and deadly hematologic disease characterized by organ dysfunction
from insoluble fibril deposition derived from clonal free light chains arising from a monoclonal gammopathy. The
disease has a high early mortality of 40-45% at two years due to heart failure. Patients with advanced AL
amyloidosis have high morbidity and mortality in the initial period after diagnosis owing to cardiac dysfunction.
Despite experiencing multiple symptoms and demonstrating signs of the disease, many patients are diagnosed
late, sometimes by years, because these ‘precursor diagnoses’ are often non-specific. Observational data also
suggest that Black individuals are more likely to be underdiagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis. Monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (MGUS+) are more
common in Black individuals, as is the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease,
both of which also occur in AL amyloidosis. We hypothesize that patients can be diagnosed early by assessing
the patterns of precursor diagnoses that predate AL amyloidosis diagnosis. Our application seeks to create an
algorithm using Bayesian machine learning statistical methodology to create an alert system that can help guide
physicians toward early consideration of an AL amyloidosis diagnosis. We will execute the following specific
aims using nationally representative Medicare data: 1) Identify patterns of precursor diagnoses associated with
the occurrence of AL amyloidosis and develop a predictive algorithm using Bayesian machine learning
techniques in Medicare beneficiaries with MGUS+. Patterns will be examined longitudinally at one-year
timepoints over a five-year period preceding the AL amyloidosis diagnosis contrasting between MGUS+ with
known AL and MGUS+ with no known AL to identify patterns that might best predict disease. 2) Study the
performance of the predictive MGUS-AL algorithm. This will be assessed internally in the Medicare data set,
overall and by race groups (Aim 2A) and external validation using TriNetX multicenter EHR data for MGUS+
patients of all ages, races, and insurance coverage (Aim 2B). 3) Estimate the number of potentially undiagnosed
AL amyloidosis patients with MGUS+. Based on the patterns identified in Aim 1 and validated in Aim 2, we will
identify subjects at high risk for undiagnosed AL amyloidosis (Aim 3A) and estimate the excess 2-year mortality
and number of potential lives saved by our early warning system, overall and by racial group (Aim 3B). This
study provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify patterns of precursor diagnoses to diagnose AL
amyloidosis early. An important anticipated outcome is to improve health disparities by increasing AL amyloidosis
diagnosis in Black individuals who are already at higher risk for MGUS and other end-organ damage associated
with AL amyloidosis. The novel, rigorous and easy-to-implement early warning system has the potential to
transform the outcomes of patients with AL amyloidosis by allowing the diagnosis to occur at an early stage."
10749055,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite
efforts to characterize PTSD pathophysiology, no biomarkers have been established to aid in
diagnosis, treatment development, and prediction of treatment response. New evidence poses
that PTSD is mediated by dysfunctional discrimination of context/cues in both threat and reward
processing, involving the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex.
Still, the contextual component, or the formation of mental boundaries of the environment (mental
representations) that delineate threat/safety and reward/non-reward cues/signals within a single
environment, and the neural circuits of these processes are yet to be studied in PTSD where
contextual processing is often impaired.
I have developed two virtual reality (VR) tasks to examine threat and reward discrimination, to
assess the underlying mechanisms of learning valence discrimination within an environment using
location-specific information. Briefly, the task used for this study consists of neutral (CS-) and
threat or reward (CS+) areas, within a single environment, and participants must use spatial
information to learn to discriminate between both areas. The task is designed to reveal brain
regions involved in learning locations predictive of environmental reward.
This research proposal aims to investigate brain activity differences between patients with PTSD
(n=80), trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (TE; n=80), and healthy controls (HC; n=80).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the VR paradigm will be used to clarify the
neural mechanisms underlying threat and reward learning and discrimination processing across
groups. Multiple levels of assessment will include multimodal MRI, coupled with peripheral
measures of arousal (e.g., Skin Conductance Response), eye-tracking, and subjective ratings of
learning.
This is a first step to clarify the process of threat and reward discrimination learning within an
environment, particularly to elucidate if the neural signatures are specific to valence signaling or
to PTSD psychopathology in general. In the long term, this research will shed light on the specific
role of brain areas needed for discrimination learning within an environment which will advance
the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD and other psychopathologies."
10821314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual assault is highly prevalent among college students and is associated with high risk for alcohol misuse
and co-occurring posttraumatic stress in survivors of all genders. These conditions are associated with
significant strain on campus service systems and substantial short- and long-term consequences for students.
Although effective preventative interventions (i.e., implemented within the months following trauma exposure)
exist for these conditions, college student survivors often do not seek or successfully access in-person care,
especially among men and racial/ethnic minorities. Mobile health (i.e., mHealth) interventions are a promising
strategy to increase low-barrier access to preventative interventions among college students. We developed
and pilot tested a multi-component mHealth preventative intervention prototype, THRIVE, to reduce
posttraumatic stress and alcohol misuse in recent survivors of sexual assault. THRIVE was effective in
reducing both posttraumatic stress and alcohol misuse, making it the first post-trauma mHealth intervention
with evidence of efficacy in reducing alcohol misuse. In the current study, we propose to conduct an
optimization trial to identify the most effective, efficient, and low-burden version of THRIVE for college
students. Prior to conducting the trial, we will revise THRIVE using the real-time user feedback collected in the
pilot trial (Aim 1). Revisions will maintain the core elements of THRIVE while increasing usability. Revisions will
be selected by reviewing the app and pilot user feedback in partnership with user experience/interface
designers, our advisory board of experts in cultural adaptations of interventions, and our advisory board of
college student survivors. This will maximize usability with attention to the needs of diverse student survivors.
Using the revised app, we will then conduct a 2x2x2 factorial randomized trial to test the unique effects of the 3
core THRIVE components (i.e., in-app activity scheduling, in-app cognitive restructuring, phone coaching) on
alcohol misuse and posttraumatic stress (Aim 2), as well as the added benefit of coaching to activity
scheduling and cognitive restructuring (Aim 3). N=464 college students with past-12-week sexual assault,
elevated drinking, and PTSD will be enrolled. All participants will receive an onboarding call and non-core app
elements (i.e., self-monitoring, encouraging statements banner, referrals), and will be randomized to
additionally receive combinations of the 3 core elements. Participants will complete self-report assessments at
baseline, daily during the intervention, post-intervention, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results will be used to
select an optimized version of THRIVE. Our design will ensure that future testing and dissemination of THRIVE
reflects maximally inclusive, efficient, and effective intervention elements. If effective, THRIVE would represent
a highly-scalable strategy that could be directly implemented by campus service systems to reduce the
substantial burden of PTSD and alcohol misuse on students."
10747408,"Project Summary/Abstract
The broad goal of this proposal is to understand how fear memories are formed and stored in the brain. Post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects nearly 5% of the world population, however, current treatments have
limited efficacy in reversing the symptoms of this disorder. Furthermore, females are more likely than males to
develop PTSD, though the mechanisms controlling this sex-dependent predisposition remain equivocal. While
established rodent fear conditioning models have aided in the elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms
supporting the formation of fear memories that underlie PTSD, these focus almost exclusively on the individual
experiencing the traumatic event. However, some cases of PTSD and associated anxiety disorders can be
acquired by witnessing a traumatic event happen to someone else in close proximity. Despite this, few studies
have examined the neurobiology of indirectly acquired fear memories and whether they differ from those of
memories for directly experienced traumatic events. Furthermore, whether there are sex differences in the
behavioral and molecular mechanisms of indirectly fear memories has yet to be explored. In our preliminary
studies using an indirect fear conditioning procedure in which an observer rat watches a demonstrator rat
associate an auditory cue with a mild footshock, we found that both male and female rats could indirectly
acquire fear memories. Genetic loss of Fmr1, which produces deficits in social behavior, resulted in an
enhancement of indirect fear memories, suggesting that social cues may not be the primary factor driving
empathetically acquired fear. Importantly, we found unique changes in protein degradation targets in the
amygdala of demonstrator and observer rats, suggesting unique molecular signatures for directly vs indirectly
acquired fear memories. The work in this proposal is designed to build off of these preliminary data and answer
important questions about the behavioral, molecular and sex-specific mechanisms controlling the formation of
indirectly acquired fear memories. Using genetic rat lines and specific manipulations to the training (learning)
experience, Aim 1 will systematically test the behavioral mechanisms (social, visual, olfactory, auditory) by
which indirect fear memories are acquired and how this varies by sex. Aim 2 will use whole genome
transcriptomic and proteomic approaches and well-established pharmacological manipulations to determine if
the formation of directly and indirectly acquired fear memories requires similar transcriptional, translational and
protein degradation mechanisms and whether this varies by sex. Collectively, this study will answer important
questions about the sex-specific mechanisms controlling the formation of memories for indirectly acquired fear
associations, which will be critical for the development of proper therapeutic interventions for the treatment of
PTSD that is acquired empathetically."

Auditory speech perception is essential for social, vocational, and emotional health in hearing individuals.
However, the reliability of auditory signals varies widely in everyday settings (e.g., at a crowded party), requiring
supplemental processes to enable accurate speech perception. The principle mechanisms that support the
perception of degraded auditory speech signals are auditory-visual (crossmodal) interactions, which can
perceptually restore speech content using visual cues provided by lipreading, rhythmic articulatory movements,
and the natural correlations present between oral resonance and mouth shape. Moreover, receptive speech
processes can be limited through a variety of causes, including intrinsic brain tumor, stroke, cochlear implant
usage, and age-related hearing loss, making compensatory crossmodal mechanisms necessary for one to
continue working and maintaining healthy social interactions. However, the physiological processes that enable
vision to facilitate speech perception remain poorly understood and no integrative model exists for how these
multiple visual dimensions combine to enhance auditory speech perception. In the auditory domain, distributed
populations of neurons encode spectro-temporal information about acoustic cues that are then transcoded into
phonemes. We propose a dual-route perceptual model through which visual signals integrate with phoneme-
coded neurons. First, a direct path through which viseme-to-phoneme conversions generate semi-overlapping
distributions of activity in the superior temporal gyrus, leading to improved hearing through improved auditory
phoneme tuning functions. Second, an indirect path through which visual features restore spectral information
about speech frequencies and alter phoneme-response timing, resulting in improved auditory spectro-temporal
profiles (which in turn are transcoded into phonemes with greater precision). Finally, we will examine the
hypothesis that our perceptual system optimizes which of these visual dimensions is prioritized for recovery
based on what is missing from the auditory signal. These studies will provide a unified framework for how speech
perception benefits from different visual signals. By understanding biological approaches to crossmodally
restoring degraded auditory speech information, we can develop better targeted rehabilitation programs and
neural prostheses to maximize speech perception recovery after trauma or during healthy aging."
10768767,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) defined as acquisition of somatic mutations in
hematopoietic cells is a common age-related condition. The prevalence of CHIP exceeds 12% over all age
groups and nearly 50% for subjects older than 85 years. Since somatic mutations frequently affect putative
cancer drivers the malignant transformation to myelodysplasia or leukemia is an obvious concern. Even though
CHIP is relatively common, the risk of progression to clinically apparent disease is low (<1% per year) and the
exact mechanism of progression is largely unknown. Thus, the appropriate risk-stratification of patients remains
challenging. In addition to its leukemogenic potential, CHIP is also an independent risk factor of chronic
inflammation, cardiovascular disease and has been associated with inferior outcome in general population and
in patients with solid tumors. One approach to address the clinical impact of clonal hematopoiesis is to identify
and prospectively follow a large cohort of individuals with CHIP. However, this approach would require large
number of subjects and long follow-up period. While the long-term prospective studies are underway we propose
to study the natural history and clinical consequences and the mechanism of clonal expansion of CHIP in
allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) setting. We have previously published that clinically silent
clones (under homeostatic conditions within the donor) expand and are selected for during the enhanced
proliferation and self-renewal required to re-establish hematopoiesis in the recipient; this implies that alloBMT
greatly hastens the natural history of CHIP, which should allow us to capture the genetic evolution, clonal
dynamics, and clinical sequelae of CHIP in an accelerated time-frame. We will 1) determine the oncogenic
potential and non-malignant adverse outcome of donor-derived CHIP in alloBMT recipients. Studying the cohort
of 1,857 bone marrow donors above the age of 40 as well as serial samples and clinical data we will better define
the oncogenic potential of low-frequency clones and distinguish true disease drivers from background genetic
events related to aging and examine the role of donor CHIP on non-malignant adverse events in alloBMT
recipients; 3) elucidate the epigenetic aberration and cellular pathway involved in clonal growth advantage; 3)
determine the impact of CHIP on the incidence of subclinical solid tumors studying nearly 10,000 females
enrolled on DETECT trial and define the role of CHIP in tumor development and progression. The
aforementioned approach will allow us 1) to better define the oncogenic potential and epigenetic aberrations in
pre-malignant clones as well as non-malignant consequences of donor CHIP in alloBMT recipients; 2) our
prospective study will not only provide an insight into the risk stratification of patients with CHIP but will also
provide a very important human model for studying clonal evolution and leukemogenesis in vivo. 3) we will better
define the impact of CHIP on subclinical tumors and the results from our study may result in implementation of
most appropriate therapies in order to avoid therapy-related malignancies and cardiovascular toxicities."
10781997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the most severe cases of epilepsy, where seizures persist despite multiple trials of anti-seizure medications,
patients may benefit from surgical removal of seizure-generating brain tissue. Prior to surgery, electrodes are
often implanted directly into or onto the patient’s brain and are used to continuously record electrical brain
activity over days. This is done to capture seizure activity and determine its point of origin, i.e. the seizure
onset zone. If the seizure onset zone is identified, clinicians then use this information, in combination with the
results of brain imaging and other testing, to guide removal of the corresponding brain tissue. While epilepsy
surgery may lead to seizure freedom, 70-90% of surgery patients remain on anti-seizure medications and
roughly 50% of patients continue to have seizures. The long-term goal of this work is to improve the outcomes
of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery by developing more accurate methods to localize seizure-generating
tissue. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have garnered considerable excitement for their potential to identify
and localize epileptogenic brain tissue. HFOs are short bursts of high-frequency electrical activity that occur in
the brains of patients with epilepsy. They occur more frequently in the epileptogenic zone (EZ, the hypothetical
area that must be excised to attain post-operative seizure freedom), and surgically removing HFO-generating
brain tissue increases the likelihood of seizure freedom. While ongoing clinical trials are attempting to assess
their prospective value for epilepsy surgery planning, there are multiple barriers to their widespread use. While
group-level results are robust, HFO analysis is not yet predictive for single subjects. Recordings lack the
sensitivity to reliably measure HFOs in every patient, and the occurrence of non-epileptic HFOs confounds the
results. Therefore, HFOs are poised to revolutionize epilepsy surgery, but there is a critical need to optimize
their measurement and maximize single-subject accuracy. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve
EZ localization accuracy through systematic determination of the optimal HFO measurement methodology,
coupled with novel, robust methods for HFO analysis. The rationale is that developing these novel methods
with improved measurement techniques will increase the accuracy and robustness of HFOs as a biomarker of
the seizure onset zone, thus improving the surgical management of epilepsy. To attain our objective, we will
pursue three specific aims: (1) Demonstrate that electrode size is a crucial factor in HFO measurement. (2)
Develop an automated method for patient-specific localization of the EZ based on HFOs. (3) Evaluate the
effects of electrode size and HFO analysis method on EZ localization. The proposed research is significant
because it will provide specific recommendations for the measurement and analysis of HFOs, enabling
accurate, detailed localization of epileptogenic brain tissue. The expected outcome of this work is that it will
guide surgeons in choosing which brain regions to remove and will increase the pool of potential surgical
candidates. Overall, this will have a positive impact by leading to a greater chance of seizure freedom and
improved quality of life for patients with the most severe cases of epilepsy."

High mutation rates in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a major cause of inherited and age-related diseases.
There is a longstanding view that the mutation-prone nature of mitochondrial genomes in humans and animal
models is a byproduct of the intense metabolic activity associated with oxidative phosphorylation and energy
conversion. However, recent evidence has challenged this idea, and there is growing recognition that
differences in the enzymatic machinery responsible for mtDNA replication and repair are a key cause of high
mutation rates in human mtDNA. Variation in mtDNA replication and repair pathways may also explain why
some eukaryotic lineages (e.g., plants) are able to suppress mutation rates in their mitochondrial genomes to
exceptionally low levels. An overarching theme of our research program is to identify the mechanisms
responsible for variation in mitochondrial mutation rates across eukaryotes and thereby help resolve the long-
term uncertainties about why rates are so high in humans. To overcome the technical challenges associated
with investigating rare events like de novo mutations, we have applied multiple innovative sequencing
technologies that can detect new DNA sequence variants present at ultra-low frequencies, essentially
capturing mutations and damaged bases as they occur and mapping them to nucleotide-level resolution. Our
future work will address two major questions. First, how do plant mitochondria achieve some of the lowest
rates of point mutations ever observed (less than one substitution per site per billion years)? This line of
investigation will build off our recent discovery that plant-MSH1 is necessary for maintaining low mutation rates
in plant organelle genomes. MSH1 is enigmatic member of the MutS gene family which was likely acquired by
horizontal transfer from giant viruses. We will test the hypothesis that it is part of a novel mechanism of
mismatch repair that induces double-stranded breaks followed by template-based recombinational repair.
Second, how do mitochondria repair bulky DNA damage introduced by UV? We will test the hypothesis that
mitochondria contain a previously unrecognized repair pathway with similarities to classic nucleotide excision
repair (NER). This hypothesis is motivated by our recent observation that exposure of divergent eukaryotic
model systems to UV light results in the release of mtDNA-derived oligonucleotides that carry damaged bases
at consistent positions and exhibit characteristic length profiles, a hallmark of NER. Overall, this research
program will help determine why mitochondrial genomes exhibit such extreme mutation rate variation across
the eukaryotic tree of life."

 Considerable epidemiological studies reveal that maternal exposure to ambient fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) poses a significant risk for obesity to the child. In animal models, we and others corroborate the adverse
programming of offspring adiposity by maternal PM2.5 exposure and implicate the offspring’s hypermethylated
and thus down-expressed Leptin in this adverse programming. In contrast, few published studies have tested the
maternal pathogenesis for this adverse programming. In order to develop effective intervention strategies that
may benefit both the mother and child, we propose to unravel its maternal pathogenesis using our unique
genetically-modified animal models and state-of-the-art PM2.5 exposure technique. Through a synthesis of both
published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that maternal PM2.5 exposure programs offspring Leptin
expression and thus adiposity via maternal pulmonary inflammation and ensuing oocyte down-expression of
Tet2, and propose to thoroughly test this hypothesis through pursuing three discrete yet linked aims: Aim 1: To
model the dose- and composition-dependencies for the adverse programming of offspring adiposity by maternal
PM2.5 exposure. Aim 2. To determine whether maternal PM2.5 exposure programs offspring adiposity through
maternal oocyte down-expression of Tet2 and subsequent offspring down-expression of Leptin. Aim 3: To
determine whether pulmonary inflammation induced by PM2.5 exposure elicits maternal oocyte disturbance and
subsequent programming of offspring adiposity. By revealing the critical pathogenesis, this project is expected to
provide a strong scientific framework for understanding of and developing interventions for the adverse
programming of offspring adiposity by maternal PM2.5 exposure."

The goal of this Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) program is to recruit, train, and mentor
a select group of exceptional postgraduate resident investigators from diverse clinical departments in acquiring
rigorous clinical and translational research skills, conducting high-impact research projects relevant to aging,
and launching promising careers in clinical or translational aging science. This initiative will build on a large and
diverse faculty with expertise in aging research, a strong institutional track record in multidisciplinary
postgraduate research training, and an existing, successful Resident Research Training Program developed by
the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute that has previously guided over a thousand residents in
completing short-term clinical or translational research projects over the past decade.
Our program will emphasize clinical and translational research, defined broadly to include early translational
science, clinical and epidemiologic investigations, population-based science, and dissemination research to
translate scientific findings into real-world settings. We have designed an intensive, 12-month, contiguous
StARR program that emphasizes rigorous training in clinical and translational research methods, recognizing
that many clinician scholars seeking to pursue clinical or translational research lack formal methodologic
training. For the initial stages of this program, we have worked closely with department and residency leaders
in internal medicine, neurology, psychiatry, anesthesia, general surgery, urology, orthopaedic surgery, and
gynecology to develop a detailed plan for recruiting and selecting the most promising resident investigators
from these fields, enhancing their research training and career development opportunities, cultivating their
relationships with experienced faculty mentors in aging research, and guiding them in obtaining future
competitive research funding, while simultaneously fulfilling necessary board credentialing requirements.
Our aims are to: 1) recruit and train 3 clinical residents annually with the potential and commitment to become
successful clinical and translational researchers in aging; 2) guide these resident investigators in obtaining
more advanced methodological, analytic, and collaborative skills appropriate for their level of training; 3) create
and support effective, influential, and long-lasting relationships with accomplished aging research mentors
during and after residency; and 4) guide scholars in successfully competing for other forms of research support
that will pave the way for them to pursue long-term careers in clinical or translational aging science."

Phagosome clearance is a major function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), one that is essential for the
health of the retina, and therefore our sense of vision. The clearance of phagosomes in the RPE is dependent
on molecular motors that orchestrate their transport towards lysosomal compartments for degradation. This
delivery involves the microtubule plus-end motor, kinesin-1. However, despite their net movement in the
anterograde direction, phagosomes exhibit bidirectional motility on microtubules in the RPE. This indicates the
actions of the retrograde motor, dynein, which moves various cargos in eukaryotic cells towards the minus-end
of microtubules. The role of dynein in the trafficking of phagosomes in the RPE is not understood. My current
research will focus on the contributions of dynein to the motility of phagosomes that promotes their efficient
clearance by the RPE. In aim 1, I will utilize state-of-the-art live-cell imaging on human RPE cells to test the
role of dynein in mediating transient interactions between phagosomes and degradative endolysosomal
compartments. In aim 2, I will perform in-depth molecular studies into the mechanisms that regulate dynein-
based transport in the RPE by investigating molecular intermediaries, called adaptor proteins, which link the
motor to its cargo. This will provide answers to how the dynein microtubule motor controls cargo specificity by
a combinatorial assembly of adaptor proteins. It will also shed light on how adaptor proteins participate in
regulating the coordination between opposing microtubule motors that brings about precise intracellular
transport. In applying for this award, my goal is to develop an independent research program at the interface of
RPE cell biology and molecular motor proteins. My development plan consists of obtaining expertise in
advanced live-cell imaging on human RPE (with Dr. David Williams, UCLA) and in-depth molecular training on
the dynein motor (with Dr. Samara Reck-Peterson, UCSD). In addition to my research training, I will attend
various conferences in vision science and general cell biology, as well as participate in UCLA-sponsored
programs that facilitate my transition to an independent principal investigator. Finally, my co-mentors will
provide me with guidance on managing a laboratory, training research staff, and preparation of grant
applications for several types of funding mechanisms. Collectively, this development plan will prepare me well
to obtain and excel in an independent position at a research institution."
10775823,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A hypothesis of aging is that the accumulation of cellular damage can lead to tissue malfunction and organismal
deterioration. A key mechanism for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preserving cell function is autophagy,
a hydrolytic cellular recycling process whereby cytosolic materials, referred to as cargo, including lipid droplets
(LDs) and damaged proteins, are degraded in the lysosome. In turn, aberrations in autophagy can result in the
accumulation of different toxic cytosolic contents, which is a molecular signature of many age-related disorders,
including neurodegeneration. While there is a prominent functional link between autophagy, aging and diseases,
the molecular mechanisms that cause the age-dependent decreases in autophagy remain unclear.
 Notably, autophagy can also selectively recruit one type of molecule for degradation. Recent studies support
the hypothesis that selective autophagy plays a crucial role in combating chronic diseases. Several human brain
post-mortem studies have uncovered lipid species that accumulate in brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), possibly impeding neuronal function and thereby contributing to neurodegeneration. Therefore, discovering
different interventions that can be used to affect lipophagy (LD turnover) selectively may be ideal for tackling
lipidotoxicity-linked AD. However, such pharmacological or genetic tools are currently unavailable. Furthermore,
selective cellular factors that can facilitate LD recruitment for lipophagy remain unknown. In this proposal, I aim
to address these greater needs in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of lipophagy and its function
relevant to aging and neurodegenerative disorders.
 Our lab recently performed a cellular LD clearance high-throughput screen to identify small molecules and
pathways that induce selective lipid clearing autophagy for slowing age-related diseases. Among these, we
identified compound A20 that clears lipids in an autophagy-dependent manner in the nematode C. elegans to
promote healthspan and lifespan. Emerging evidence suggests that A20 may act via lipophagy to clear lipids. I
hypothesize that uncovering the lipophagy mechanism utilized by A20 will help us identify novel lipophagy
regulators. Furthermore, since lipid accumulation is now linked to AD, I will employ a novel human AD patient-
derived organoid model (3D neuronal culture with astrocytes) to determine whether A20 normalizes the lipid-
linked pathogenic signature and normalizes pathogenic molecular phenotypes. Finally, I will characterize the
functional changes in lipophagy and lipid homeostasis during AD using these human-derived organoid models.
 My studies are significant, as they will help us generate new mechanistic insights towards lipophagy activation
during aging linked to AD. Such knowledge is vital to further our understanding of diseases exhibiting a lipophagy
deregulation component. Furthermore, completion of these studies may potentially reveal strategies that could
be used to combat neurodegenerative diseases."
10809025,"Project Summary/Abstract: In 2020 there will be ~ 276,480 estimated new cases of invasive breast cancer
(BCa) among women in the US, causing an estimated ~ 42,170 deaths. Two common mechanisms for the
sustenance of BCa are epigenetic dysfunction and the malfunction of endocrine proteins such as estrogen
receptor (ER). The specific focus of the studies proposed in this application is to repurpose deferiprone (Def),
an FDA-approved iron chelator, as a template for the discovery of novel histone lysine demethylase (KDM)
inhibitors optimized for BCa therapy. Most compounds that have been or are being developed clinically exhibit
greater efficacy for a subtype of BCa. In this regard, therapeutic interventions that capitalize on ER signaling
malfunctions, a driver of more than 70% of BCas, have enjoyed measured success in BCa therapy and/or chemo-
prevention. However, despite initial benefits, most patients eventually relapse due to acquired resistance to these
drugs. Additionally, there are no targeted treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a BCa
subtype lacking ER, Human Epidermal Growth Factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Progesterone Receptor (PR) and
which accounts for over 20% of BCa incidence. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for increasingly
selective and potent drugs to treat early and resistant stages of all BCa subtypes.
 BCa viability, regardless of ER expression status, depends on an extensive network of epigenetic
modifiers - histone mark writers, readers and erasers. Bioinformatic and functional analysis have identified
specific subfamilies of the amino oxidase and Jumonji family of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs), histone
methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone deacetylase (HDACs) as essential in supporting ERα signaling
activation. Among these epigenetic modifiers, KDM1, KDM3A, KDM5A, KDM5B and KDM6A are exquisitely
wired into ERα signaling and are collectively vital for BCa cell viability. Moreover, studies have implicated KDMs
such as KDM6A in other ER-independent epigenetic reprograming which sustains TNBC as well. Unlike ERα
signaling, pharmacological inhibition of KDMs has not been clinically validated. Although inhibition of KDM3A,
KDM5A, KDM5B and KDM6A caused BCa cells growth arrest in vitro and in vivo, there are however precedents
for compensation among KDM paralogs in tumor models generated by selective deletion of a paralog member.
This study hypothesizes that collective inhibition of KDM paralogs implicated in BCa etiology will blunt the
possibility of compensation among KDM paralogs that could occur from paralog selective inhibition, resulting in
novel selective and potent drugs to treat BCa regardless of the cell ER expression status. The proposed study
is designed to test this hypothesis. The specific aims are: 1) Develop Def-based KDM inhibitors with favorable
toxicological and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. 2) Characterize the correlation between intracellular on-target
effects (pharmacodynamics) and whole cell antiproliferative activity. 3) Investigate the in vivo efficacy of lead
compounds in five BCa murine models."

The mammalian brain has the remarkable capacity to store and retrieve memories. In particular, salient events
called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are implicated in the consolidation and recall of memories in the hippocampus.
These events are high frequency oscillations caused by synchronous depolarizations across both hippocampal
hemispheres, and they occur during awake rest or sleep. During SWRs, neural ensembles that are activated
during awake experiences are reactivated in rest in compressed sequences of short durations, a process called
‘replay’. Because of their large-scale nature, sharp-wave ripples and replay events can potentially shape
plasticity within hippocampal ensembles to promote memory. Studies have shown that lengthening the duration
of SWRs can improve memory on spatial tasks performed less than 24 hours later, while disrupting SWRs will
impair memory on these spatial tasks. Though SWRs can influence memory processes on short timescales, their
role in preserving memories across long timescales remains largely unknown. This proposal will explore the
hypothesis that SWRs enhance the stability of long-term memories by generating plasticity to form and maintain
ensembles.
We will investigate how SWRs shape the stability of spatial memories encoded in hippocampal region CA1 during
navigation in virtual reality environments. This study will address two aims. In Aim 1, we will measure the effects
SWRs have on the stability of the population-wide place code and replay events across weeks. The proposed
experiments will leverage in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings to evaluate
whether SWRs causally create stable ensembles on the population level across weeks. In Aim 2, we will
determine how SWRs and replay events shape microcircuit organization within replay ensembles. These
experiments will utilize a high-speed two-photon optogenetic stimulation approach to optically measure causal
functional connectivity between cells within the replay ensemble and to determine whether SWRs can generate
plasticity to recruit cells into the replay ensemble. We hypothesize that SWRs contribute to establishing
temporally stable memory traces by strengthening the causal functional connections within replay ensembles.
These results will provide insight on neural mechanisms that stabilize memory ensembles across long
timescales, which is critical for understanding how long-term memory processes are implemented. Long-term
memory is impaired in patients with memory disorders and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, dementia,
and amnesia, so findings from this proposal will help provide a foundation for understanding the pathology of
these conditions and will help in the development of new therapies for these patients."
10885918,"Project Summary: Patient-provider relationships characterized by high levels of commitment and trust are
central to delivering high quality care for improved hypertension (HTN)-related outcomes. Unfortunately, health
disparity populations are least likely to be in patient-provider relationships characterized by high levels of
commitment and trust leading to negative affective, behavioral and physiological patient outcomes including
heightened anxiety during the interaction, medication non-adherence, and poor blood pressure (BP) control.
COVID-19 not only highlighted these social inequities but also led to a rapid change of our health system – from
mainly in-person to telehealth visits. While telehealth has shown great promise in improving the clinical
management of HTN, its impact on patient-provider relationships is unclear. Some evidence suggests telehealth
could strengthen these relationships through improved access to the care team, but its technical and
interpersonal drawbacks may reduce commitment and trust. To address these gaps, this proposal will leverage
the infrastructure established by our NIMHD-funded R01, which will support 10 primary care clinics in the
integration of technology-facilitated team care (herein called ALTA) to improve medication adherence and BP
control in health disparity populations. ALTA enhances standard in-person and telehealth visits with opportunities
for patients and providers to interact via secure messaging through the electronic health record (EHR) and patient
portals. While a central premise of ALTA is that it will build clinic capacity to deliver equitable, high-quality care
to health disparity populations, it was not designed to evaluate the impact of healthcare technologies on patient-
provider relationships. Guided by the multilevel NIMHD research framework, the proposed study will employ a
mixed methods study design that links four data sources to rigorously evaluate the multilevel impacts of ALTA
on relationship commitment (primary outcome), patient-provider trust (secondary outcome) and patient health
outcomes (tertiary outcomes) across 10 primary care clinics and 700 patients with uncontrolled HTN (Aims 1
and 2). Our evaluation strategy will combine cognitive, affective and behavioral measures of the patient-provider
relationship and patient outcomes to create a multifaceted view of how individual perceptions and actions of the
partners change when ALTA is introduced. Specifically, validated self-report measures (e.g., State Anxiety
Inventory) will be augmented by automated text analysis of audiotaped interactions and secure messaging using
natural language processing techniques, and EHR-extracted data on clinic and home BP readings and
medication adherence (i.e., pharmacy records). Aim 3 will explore potential contextual factors (e.g., equity; digital
literacy; communication modality) that influence the relationship between ALTA and the interpersonal and
patient-level outcomes using self-report and EHR-derived measures. Aim 4 will use the human centered design
approach to systematically gather feedback from clinic stakeholders to identify best practices for effective
technology-facilitated patient-provider relationships."

10794946,"Abstract – Core B: Viral Testing Core
The Viral Testing Core is a critical component for the maintenance of a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Indian
rhesus macaque (Ind RM) (Macaca mulatta) breeding colony. Rhesus macaques infected with the Simian
Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) are the preferred animal model for AIDS studies and are used to examine many
aspects of viral pathogenesis, AIDS vaccine development, and exploratory new systemic and mucosal antiviral
therapies, including early events not readily studied in human patients. The presence of certain viruses can
confound the results of AIDS-related investigations. SPF colonies have been developed using state-of-the art
assays to eliminate animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Type D simian retrovirus (SRV) simian T-
lymphotropic virus (STLV-1); and herpes B virus (Macacine herpesvirus-1), which is a potential health risk for
personnel handling the animals. The goal of the Viral Testing Core is to provide techniques and expertise to
assure the continuing SPF status of the Ind RM breeding colony at the Southwest National Primate Research
Center (SNPRC). In order to fulfill this goal, the following Specific Aims will be completed: Specific Aim 1: to
provide a reliable and sensitive in-house viral screening method. This screening method is intended to produce
reliable results in a fast turnaround time. We will continue to use the Charles River Laboratories (CRL) Multiplex
Fluorescent ImmunoAssay (FMIA) for serological screening of all animals, which represents one of the current
state-of-the-art surveillance techniques. Specific Aim 2: to increase the research value of the SNPRC Ind RM
breeding colony by expanding serology testing. The core is ever evolving in the use of state-of-the-art techniques
and expanding to detect other pathogens of interest. In recent years, we extended our serology testing to include
detection of antibodies against measles virus and Trypanosoma cruzi. Presence of antibodies to measles is used
to confirm immune responses to the colony active measles immunization effort. Serological screening for
antibodies to the causative agent of Chagas Disease, along with PCR confirmatory testing, is used to 1) assist
animal selection; 2) to determine the prevalence of this infection in the NHP colonies; and 3) to improve and
evaluate the effectiveness of our pest control system. Finally, SNPRC has recently screened the SPF colony for
SARS-CoV-2 by both serology and PCR. Following recommendations developed by the National Primate
Research Center Pathogen Detection Working Group, the Viral Testing Core has developed an algorithm that
incorporates results from the serological viral screening with both serological and PCR confirmatory assays.
Additionally, the Core will continue to participate in activities proposed by the national Breeding Colony

10794951,"Abstract– Core C: MHC Genetic Typing Core
The objectives of the MHC Genetic Typing Core are to support the genetic characterization and breeding strategy
of the rhesus macaque SPF Colony, with a focus towards optimizing the colony for AIDS-related research. The
Core's three aims build upon the current strengths of the Core and incorporate genome-wide approaches
towards more rigorous genetic characterization of the colony.
Specific aim 1: MHC Class I alleles, important to AIDS investigators, will be genotyped using high resolution
 sequencing in collaboration with Wisconsin NPRC Genomics Services. The genotypes on 175 animals
 will be obtained each year.
Specific aim 2: GbS (170 animals per year), whole exome sequence (WES) (24 animals per year) and whole
 genome sequencing (WGS) (9 animals per year) will be generated to provide a) a more robust AIMs set
 defining Indian and Chinese ancestry information both genome-wide and at specific loci, b) parentage
 information to verify pedigrees and investigate colony origins, c) genotypic information to allow for the
 identification of animals carrying known and newly identified alleles relevant for AIDS research and
 impacting infectious disease pathogenesis and vaccine-effectiveness, and d) genetic data to share with
 the broader research community.
Specific aim 3: Genetic data from Aims 1 and 2 will be used to maximize genetic diversity of the colony, while
 maintaining sufficient numbers of animals with specific MHC Class I alleles and ancestry for SIV/HIV
 related studies. Core C will work with the SPF Oversight Committee and Core A to assemble breeding
 groups across our single colony using parent animals from original Colonies 1 and 2 and newly acquired
animals.
Our characterization of the SNPRC U42-supported SPF Indian rhesus macaque colony will provide critical
genomics-based information to ensure the availability of these valuable animals for AIDS researchers for many
colony generations to come. Furthermore, our genomics-based data will also be important for the planned
expansion of the U42-supported colony."
10759371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oligodendrocytes are a highly specialized type of glial cell that myelinates axons of the vertebrate CNS, both
promoting rapid transmission of nerve impulses via saltatory conduction and providing metabolic and trophic
support for the axons. A widely held consensus view in the field holds that the loss of this oligodendrocyte
support (as seen in demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis) directly contributes to axonal loss and
cumulative disability. Nevertheless, direct experimental evidence for oligodendrocyte support being required for
axonal survival is largely lacking. In addition, there is remarkably little information available on how neurons
respond to a primary demyelinating insult. To better understand whether loss of oligodendrocyte support of
axons directly leads to axonal loss or neuronal changes, we will capitalize on two tamoxifen-inducible
conditional knockout mouse strains for the Myrf gene, which encodes a transcription factor required for
myelination and myelin maintenance. The Myrf∆iPLP mouse line leads to oligodendrocyte loss and severe CNS
demyelination, but largely remyelinates through recruitment of non-recombined OPCs. In contrast, the
Myrf∆iSox10 mouse line shows near complete CNS demyelination with remyelination failure, representing a
unique mouse model of severe and chronic demyelination.
Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that neurons are initially resilient to even severe demyelinating
insults, but that they become vulnerable to loss in the face of subsequent remyelination failure, inflammation or
metabolic challenge. In addition, we have found activation of the DLK/JNK/c-Jun axonal stress pathway in
chronically demyelinated animals, providing a potential molecular signal linking chronic demyelination to
neurodegeneration. We will use retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in these mice as the ideal myelinated neuronal
population to: 1) determine the relative roles of remyelination failure, neuroinflammation and metabolic
challenge in inducing neurodegeneration; 2) establish the role of the DLK/JNK/c-Jun in mediating neuronal
changes following loss of oligodendrocyte support and 3) Use bulk and single cell RNA-Seq to determine the
transcriptional changes in RGCs in response to loss of glial support and to determine whether specific
subgroups of RGCs show preferential vulnerability to demyelination."
10771111,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the US male population, with an estimated 160,000 new cases
in 2018. Treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP), complete surgical excision of the prostate, results in
favorable oncologic outcomes with long-term survival benefits. Nerve-sparing RP is favored if cancer does not
involve the neurovascular bundles since patients have better recovery of sexual function and continence, major
factors determining postoperative quality of life. However current preoperative methods do not accurately identify
patients who could be treated by nerve-sparing RP. The NeuroSAFE study, Schlomm, et al., 2012 demonstrated
that comprehensive intraoperative frozen section analysis (FSA) of margins near the neurovascular bundles
increased the rate of nerve-sparing RPs. However comprehensive intraoperative FSA required extensive time
and personnel, which is impractical for most hospitals. Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) can generate images of
freshly excised tissue resembling H&E histology, without freezing or microtoming, reducing the time and labor
required for pathology evaluation. We developed custom NLM technology and specimen handing/staining
protocols for rapid, high-throughput evaluation of prostatectomy specimens. Our preliminary data demonstrates
that NLM detects prostate cancer with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to formalin fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) H&E in a study of 122 RP specimens from 40 patients with blinded reading by three
pathologists. NLM promises to enable intraoperative evaluation of RP specimens with a simplified workflow that
is practical for widespread clinical adoption. Our hypothesis is: NLM can be used to rapidly assess prostate
surgical specimens and increase nerve-sparing RP rates without increasing positive margin rates. This is a
collaborative, multidisciplinary program with investigators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Harvard Medical School. Aim 1 will develop next generation NLM
technology and clinical workflow for rapid, comprehensive evaluation of prostate specimens in RP. These
advances will enable a two person team (histotech/resident and pathologist) to perform comprehensive NLM of
RP margins adjacent to the neurovascular bundles, faster and with much fewer personnel than NeuroSAFE.
Aim 2 will perform a randomized controlled trial with patients undergoing robotic RP. The primary endpoints will
be the rate of nerve-sparing RPs and rate of positive surgical margins in areas adjacent to the neurovascular
bundles in a study group receiving intraoperative NLM margin assessment and standard-of-care postoperative
FFPE histology versus a control group receiving standard-of-care FFPE postoperative histology. The secondary
endpoints will be agreement between intraoperative NLM versus postoperative histology in the study arm and
surgical times in the study arm versus control arm. Aim 3 will develop NLM technology and workflows that enable
remote NLM evaluation which would increase access to pathologists with subspecialty expertise, streamline
pathologist workflow, and facilitate adoption of intraoperative margin assessment in RP."

There is an outstanding need for a national cadre of quantitatively sophisticated oncologists, with deep training
in both biological aspects of cancer and computational tools to further understanding and treatment. In the
proposed training program, OHSU will leverage the strengths of both its cancer program, ranging from basic
science to translation, and its computational capacity, spanning from genomics to mechanistic modeling. OHSU
was recently ranked as the top young university in life sciences research in the world in the Nature Index. A key
strength of the training program will be required co-mentorship by both quantitative and wet-lab basic or clinical
faculty. Post-doctoral trainees arriving with expertise in either biology or computation will receive extensive

The main goal of the Specialized Training in Anesthesiology Team Science (STAT) Program is to develop
competent investigative anesthesiologists in broad areas of research including basic, clinical/translational, and
outcomes research. This novel training plan allows for the creation of an interdisciplinary team of mentors to
form innovative research projects using a collaborative team science approach. Our program structure ensures
that each STAT trainee will have a unique individualized training plan that will assist them into entry-level, full-
time, academic faculty positions in Anesthesiology. A mentorship team will be created for each STAT trainee
which includes both extramurally funded biomedical researchers and leaders with Anesthesiology to help guide
their career development. A total of 32 participating faculty mentors representing 17 departments are categorized
into the 3 main areas of research: basic science, clinical/translational, and outcomes. STAT trainees will be
exposed to interdisciplinary research and undergo formalized training in grant/manuscript writing, biostatistics,
rigor, and responsibility in research, and cover ethical topics in research. The STAT track allows for a research-
intensive experience during their clinical training which includes research elective time followed by 24 months of
NIH-supported research following the completion of their residency. Our goal is to recruit, develop, and retain
motivated individuals from a diverse background that will broaden the scope of research in Anesthesiology. The
proposed training plan aims to continue the strong tradition of developing physician-scientists within the
Department of Anesthesiology at MCW while branching out into various disciplines to perform cutting-edge
research. Individuals who complete the STAT program will be well positioned to succeed in the academic
environment, make impactful discoveries, and become future leaders in our field."
10732262,"A molecular understanding of the events responsible for Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) organ invasion
during bacteremia remains elusive although its consequences are devastating. We have closely examined the
interaction between capsule and vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and developed the hypothesis that capsule
dynamics are complex and impact all stages of Spn translocation across VEC. This includes attachment,
receptor mediated endocytosis (RME), resistance to intracellular killing, and trafficking to the basolateral
surface for organ invasion. Testing of our hypothesis will reveal the intracellular mechanics of Spn trafficking
that drive organ invasion. Our results will impact risk assessment strategies for serotype-based vaccine design.
AIM 1. Determine how serotype impacts platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFr) and laminin-receptor
initiated adhesion/uptake of Spn. Our preliminary results indicate capsule has serotype-variable antagonistic
effects on the bacterium's interaction with host cells that affects RME. We will use a comprehensive panel of
isogenic capsule switch mutants of low and high invasive disease capability, specifically focusing on serotypes
belonging to the same serogroup, i.e., having single and defined molecular differences in their capsule
structure, to determine how specific biochemical features, such as acetylation, affect interactions with both
peripheral and cerebral VEC. We will quantify serotype dependence of surface exposure of the Spn adhesins
phosphorylcholine (PC) and choline binding protein A (CbpA), its effect on adhesion to their ligands PAFr and
LR, respectively, on receptor-initiated signaling responsible for uptake, and in summate, on invasion rate.
AIM 2. Determine how serotype influences the path taken by intracellular Spn for translocation vs
recycling vs removal. The degradation of cargo taken up by RME in non-phagocytic cells is mediated by the
novel LC3-associated endocytic recycling pathway `LANDO'. Thus, LANDO is likely a critical pathway co-opted
by the pneumococcus to cross VEC. Using low and highly invasive capsule mutant swaps, we will determine
the ability of PAFr and LR to initiate LANDO. We will subsequently determine the impact of capsule and
serotype on Spn trafficking across wild type vs LANDO deficient VEC in vitro. We will characterize targeting of
Spn into heart and brain of pafr-/-, LANDO deficient, and LR-blocked mice, thereby assessing how capsule
modulates vital endocytic processes at the crossroads of bacterial translocation vs death in the lysosome.
AIM 3. Determine how capsule shedding impacts bacterial fate within VEC. Whereas pneumococci in the
bloodstream are encapsulated when taken up by VEC, our results suggest capsule is shed within the
endosome following RME and provides protection from low pH and oxidative stress which are deployed to kill
the bacterium. We will determine the status of capsule (shed or unshed) and the importance of shedding on
Spn as they cross the VEC. We will determine if serotype impacts the kinetics of capsule shedding by Spn and
how capsule type and shedding influences endosome acidification and lysosome fusion."

 The Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (DBEI) and the Abramson Cancer Center
(ACC), in collaboration with the Division of Hematology-Oncology of the Department of Medicine and the
Division of Oncology of the Department of Pediatrics, all at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of
Medicine (PSOM), propose to continue an innovative, rigorous, and successful training program for
investigators in cancer clinical epidemiology. Five postdoctoral positions per year are requested.
 This training program attracts trainees from across the country; its graduates are placed in institutions
nationwide, resulting in a high impact training program. The specific aims of the training program are to: 1)
train the next generation of investigators to address novel and critical cancer epidemiology questions with
innovative analytic methods and transdisciplinary research collaborations; 2) provide in-depth knowledge of
clinical epidemiology research methods for research questions across the cancer care continuum and lifespan;
3) provide intensive, supervised research experience resulting in first-authored publications with mentors who
have active research programs in pediatric and adult cancer; and 4) promote synergies between epidemiology
trainees and investigators outside of epidemiology through seminars and workshops offered at DBEI, the ACC,
the pediatric and adult clinical oncology divisions, and other research centers at Penn and CHOP.
 Didactic training is provided through the Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) program and
the directors of the training program receive regular feedback to optimize the progress of each fellow. The
principal concepts of rigorous research are taught in courses of fundamental epidemiological methods, cancer
and molecular epidemiology, and biostatistics, elective courses relevant to the trainees’ methodologic interests;
journal clubs and clinical research conferences conducted by participating faculty, the DBEI, ACC, and adult
and pediatric oncology divisions; independent readings; and instruction in the responsible conduct of research.
 Strengths of the proposed program are: 1) the history of successful research training programs in the DBEI,
ACC, and adult and pediatric oncology divisions, including this training program; 2) the collaborative links
among faculty with interests in clinical research in cancer; 3) the comprehensive course offerings and research
programs that are available to trainees; and 4) an extensive set of experienced faculty with successful training
records. In addition, numerous existing large databases that can be used for research projects and training; a
broad array of specialized analytic capabilities available for clinical studies employing methods of clinical
epidemiology, and commitment of faculty to collaborative research and training, combine to provide an ideal
environment for this training program. Finally, the PSOM promote an academic environment in which basic and
clinical research are encouraged and viewed as attractive career paths for physicians."

The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of the threat posed by infectious diseases, but other priority
pathogens, such as Lassa and Ebola viruses, continue to pose signiﬁcant challenges in endemic areas.
Infection with Lassa, Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses can lead to diverse acute and long-term outcomes,
ranging from mild or asymptomatic disease to long-term sequelae or death. When we established the
Center for Viral Systems Biology (CViSB, cvisb.org) in 2018, we set a main goal of answering why. With a
focus on Ebola, Lassa, and via a scope expansion, COVID-19, we have achieved this goal by identifying
clinical, immunological, genetic, and virus molecular factors that determine the outcome of disease.
In this renewal application, we will move beyond standard systems biology data generation and analysis
and use a reverse translational approach to expand on our prior work with a focus on both fundamental
research and translational application. Our central hypothesis remains that complex networks of viral
and human factors, including distinct clinical, immunological, genetic, virological, and physiological
attributes play key roles in determining the outcome and spread of Lassa, Ebola, and COVID-19. Our
overall goal is to identify these molecular networks and provide a deep system-level understanding of the
virus, host, and environmental drivers of disease severity and spread to discover predictive markers of
human disease. We will successfully achieve this goal by applying ‘omics’ technologies, wearables, and
high-throughput experimental approaches to unique patient, vaccinee, and survivor cohorts in West
Africa and the United States. Built around two interconnected projects and four cores, we will complete
the following major goals: (1) we will integrate complex systems immunology, host genetic, physiological,
clinical, and metabolic datasets to perform predictive modeling and deﬁne biosignatures that describe
the risk, severity, and outcome of Lassa, Ebola, and COVID-19 using cohorts in West Africa and the United
States. (2) We will integrate large-scale host-virus genomic datasets with population data and
high-throughput experimental approaches to build multivariate network analyses and dynamic growth
models to elucidate the molecular epidemiology, functional evolution, adaptive immunity, and
host-pathogen dynamics of Lassa virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2. (3) We will expand and develop
high-throughput experimental methods, open-source software, machine learning tools, and web-based
platforms to analyze and visualize large-scale datasets that enable real-time interrogation and
interpretation of complex host-pathogen-environment network structures and dynamics. (4) We will
continue to develop and maintain robust databases and application programming interfaces for
open-source CViSB generated systems biology datasets and perform outreach and training to promote
the use of systems biology to study infectious diseases."

educating underrepresented scholars in biomedical research since its inception in 2010. The IMSD program
previously supported as a R25 is now being formalized under a T32 mechanism while maintaining the rigor and
excellence of training underrepresented minorities in biomedical sciences. The program has enrolled 26 pre-
doctoral students and graduated 10 scholars with a PhD, with 13 that are currently in training. Our graduates
have gone on to careers as scientists in biomedical industries and into postdoctoral research positions at highly
prestigious institutions. The VCU IMSD program has a strong emphasis on mentorship with faculty receiving
mentorship training. Safe lab practices, rigor and reproducibility and quantitative studies are essential elements
within this training program to ensure that we develop a diverse pool of scientists with skills to impact biomedical
research. The IMSD program is housed within the Center on Health Disparities and forms part of an integrative
cohort of NIGMS supported research training programs. Three students per year will be selected from a growing
pool of applicants to the biomedical research programs at VCU School of Medicine and receive funding for two
years, resulting in a cohort of 6 funded scholars/year. The VCU IMSD T32 is an interdisciplinary program with
state-of-the-art biomedical research training in diverse disciplines (Neuroscience, Microbiology and Immunology,
Pharmacology and Toxicology, Physiology and Biophysics, Molecular and Human Genetics). In addition to the
discipline specific requirements, the IMSD program will provide curricular activities that include opportunities to
engage in health disparities courses. Incorporating health disparities courses into graduate-level curriculum will
be of additional value in developing competencies necessary for biomedical professions and in motivating
students to help eliminate health disparities during their diverse careers. IMSD scholars will be accepted into the
program early and exposed to a pre-PhD program during summer prior to matriculation to their PhD programs.
The pre-PhD program will focus on developing critical thinking skills, provide laboratory research and mini-
course in Biochemistry to prepare students for the rigor of graduate training. Mentors will receive training in
several aspects of mentoring including effective communication and developing compacts with the mentees. A
cohort of faculty members have been trained as facilitators for mentoring, including the PI’s of this training grant.
The long-term goal of this program is to increase the applicant pool of underrepresented minorities to the PhD
programs and facilitate trainees to pursue biomedical research as a career path. It is expected that the VCU
IMSD program will continue to enrich the individual student scholar, the broader learning community and the
nations system of higher education."
10755659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of phospholipid bilayer-enclosed particles that are
released by all types of cells, and even more so by tumor cells. Since the biomolecular cargoes of tumor-
derived EVs mirror those of the parental tumor cells, characterizing tumor-derived EVs and profiling their cargo
are expected to be of substantial diagnostic value. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fourth most common
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, most often develops in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis
secondary to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or hepatitis B/C
infections. Cirrhosis from any cause is a well-established risk factor for HCC; however, current surveillance
regimens with abdominal imaging and serum biomarkers (e.g., AFP) have poor sensitivity for diagnosing HCC
at an early stage, when it is potentially curable. Therefore, biomarkers that sensitively distinguish early-stage
HCC from at-risk liver cirrhosis are desperately needed. Exploring the diagnostic potential of HCC EVs and EV
cargo profiling for detecting early-stage HCC holds great promise to significantly augment the ability of current
diagnostic modalities.
We propose an HCC EV digital scoring assay for detecting early-stage HCC, which couples two very powerful
technologies: EV Click Chip for purification of HCC EVs and reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-
ddPCR) for EV cargo profiling. One of the major challenges emerging in the field of EV utilization for clinical
use is the lack of robust and reproducible methods for the isolation of a pure tumor-derived EV population.
Conventional methods for isolating EVs, such as ultracentrifugation, filtration, and precipitation, are incapable
of discriminating tumor-derived EVs from non-tumor-derived EVs. New research efforts have been devoted to
exploring immunoaffinity-based capture techniques for enriching tumor-derived EVs in different solid tumors.
However, there are challenges identified for the single antibody-mediated tumor-derived EV enriching
approaches, such as limited sensitivity/specificity and a need for multiple capture antibodies to overcome the
tumor heterogeneity. The EV Click Chips can address these concerns with a 2-step covalent chemistry-based
tumor-derived EV purification (click chemistry-mediated EV capture/disulfide cleavage-driven EV release)
instead of antibody-mediated EV capture. The purified HCC EVs can then be characterized by quantifying a
panel of 20 HCC-specific mRNA markers by incorporating RT-ddPCR technology. The proposed research will
conduct: i) an exploratory development and optimization of the two functional components (i.e., EV Click Chip
and RT-ddPCR) and analytically validate the proposed HCC EV digital scoring assay, and ii) an evaluation of
the diagnostic performance of the proposed HCC EV digital scoring assay for detecting early-stage HCC using
training and validation cohorts. The long-term goal of this R01 proposal is to develop, optimize, and validate
the proposed HCC EV digital scoring assay for detecting early-stage HCC from at-risk liver cirrhotic patients."
10793490,"Abstract Despite multi-drug prophylaxis, aGVHD affects 20-70% of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant
(allo-HCT) patients. V-region Immunoglobulin-containing Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA), a negative
checkpoint regulator expressed on resting naïve mouse and human T cells. A single dose of agonist VISTA
monoclonal antibody (mAb) on allo-HCT day 0 causes antigen-specific operational tolerance by deletion and
anergy in resting naïve T cells that have concurrent T cell receptor (TCR) signals and 90-100% long-term
survival. VISTA has been linked to induced Treg generation, expansion, stability and maintenance. In acute
graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD), agonist mAb increases peripheral Tregs; the extent to which pTregs contribute
to operational tolerance will be explored (aim 1A). Limited data exist for aGVHD prevention. Polyclonal CD4 T
cells are the dominant aGVHD effectors in MHC disparate aGVHD models and TCR signaling is critical for
deletion/anergy; studies are proposed using high affinity donor TCR transgenic and polyclonal CD4 and/or
CD8 T cells will assess operation tolerance and long-term survival in MHC and minor antigen disparate
models. Tetramers will track polyclonal and monoclonal donor allospecific T cells in agonist mAb treated mice.
Frequently used calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may alter TCR signals below a threshold needed for agonist mAb
effects; testing is required before translation (aim 1C). A unique feature of VISTA is downregulation with T cell
activation. Non-alloreactive T cells and alloreactive T cells escaping agonist mAb induced deletion/anergy may
permit generation of leukemia-specific T cells (aim 1B). Steroids are first line therapy for aGVHD patients but
only half the patients have day 28 complete responses; 1-year survival rate for steroid refractory (SR) aGVHD
patients is dismal. In mice and patients, we show myeloid cell infiltration is 2.5-fold higher than T cells in gut, a
primal aGVHD organ in SR aGVHD. VISTA is expressed on myeloid cells at >10-fold higher levels than T cells.
Agonist mAb inhibits myeloid cell chemotaxis and reprograms inflammatory monocytes/macrophages into anti-
inflammatory cells. We hypothesize that agonist mAb reprograming of gut monocytes/macrophages can treat
SR aGVHD (aim 2). Our central hypothesis is agonist VISTA mAb has dual uses for aGVHD prevention,
inducing T cell operational tolerance, and SR aGVHD therapy, reprogramming myeloid cells to be anti-
inflammatory. Our aims will test the hypotheses that: Operational tolerance induced by agonist mAb
allospecific deletion/anergy of donor T cells depends on in vivo Treg induction, permits unaffected T cells to
generate leukemia-specific responses, and is subverted by day 0 inflammation or CNIs initiated pre-transplant
(aim 1). In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that agonist mAb reprograms inflammatory monocytes and
macrophages in the gut to be anti-inflammatory and locally release of immune suppressive cytokines,
ameliorating SR aGVHD without systemic side-effects of exogenous cytokines. Our studies are foundational
for translation of Noelle’s agonist human VISTA mAb for aGVHD prevention and SR aGVHD therapy."
10757635,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCCs) are devastating upper airway tumors that are associated
with an immunosuppressive network impacting the tumor microenvironment, bone marrow and the peripheral
blood compartments. The development of novel biomarkers of cancer immunity have not kept pace with
breakthroughs in our understanding of cancer-associated inflammation and its relationship with abnormal
hematopoiesis and the production of immunosuppressive leukocyte populations. Nor have biomarkers kept pace
with clinical indications for use of immunomodulatory therapies. Here, we address the gap in clinically applicable
immune biomarkers by first developing unique immuno-methylomic tools to identify aberrant peripheral immune
cell populations, followed by the application of such tools for studying HNSCC survivorship. The FDA recently
approved pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for metastatic, or unresectable
recurrent disease, which is poised to dramatically increase the number of patients receiving immunotherapy for
HNSCC, further underscoring the critical need to identify biomarkers of response to treatment, even before de
facto issues of drug cost. Further, recent successful trials of immunomodulatory agents treating late stage
HNSCC reveal that there is a crucial role for the immune system in disease survival and prognosis. To
understand and quantify immune status, we propose to apply novel DNA methylation-based immune
phenotyping biomarkers that will define the immune suppressive state and allow us to intensively study its
relationship to immunotherapy treatment response in HNSCC. The proposed study will draw from two
independent, comparable, prospectively collected patient cohorts at NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer
Centers. Results from single cell tracing approaches to follow clones of cells in-vivo in cancer patients showed
dramatic evidence that the intrinsic ability to attract new immune cells to the tumor results in improved checkpoint
blockade activity. This finding strongly supports our approach to identifying biomarkers of checkpoint blockade
response through measures in the peripheral blood. As new immunotherapies are developed for HNSCC, it is
crucial to mediate the effects of the host’s compromised immune system. The new generation of epigenetic
techniques for immune profiling will provide biomarkers that are useful both in assessing immune status and in
addressing mechanisms of immune modifiers."

Of the 130,000 older (≥50) kidney transplant (KT) recipients in the US, we have estimated that 19% experience
post-KT cognitive decline putting them at elevated risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).
Compared to a 10-year ADRD risk of 0.6-0.9% for community-dwelling older adults, the risk of ADRD diagnosis
is 1.0%-6.7% for older recipients; overall, 7.2-17.0% of older recipients receive a dementia diagnosis within 10
years of KT. Yet, the true burden of ADRD is substantially higher given that only half of patients who would
meet diagnostic criteria for dementia receive a diagnosis. A post-KT ADRD diagnosis leads to disability and
dependence, and increases a patient’s risk of mortality 2.4-fold and their risk of graft loss 1.5-fold. Within 10
years of an ADRD diagnosis, 88.6% of older recipients have died and 38.9% have experienced graft loss.
These preliminary data arise from my current NIH funded research: 1. Prospective cohort study: 12-year-old
study of frailty and cognitive function among KT patients; and 2. RCT: 2x2 factorial RCT of interventions to
preserve cognitive function among patients initiating hemodialysis. I have established a strong track record and
built a research program at the intersection of aging and renal epidemiology which serves as a foundation for
this mid-career Independent Scientist (K02) award application. Through this research I have realized that
focusing on physical aging without also understanding cognitive aging provides an incomplete picture of older
KT patients. As I transition to more administrative duties in 2022, I am unable to expand to ADRD research and
develop collaborative relationships with neurocognitive investigators. This K02 will advance my research
career by affording me the opportunity for dedicated time to concentrate efforts on career development to
expand my research portfolio to include ADRD. My long-term career objective is to establish a sustainable
research program focused on physical and cognitive aging among KT recipients. To accomplish these goals, I
seek protected time to acquire the knowledge and skills needed: 1. To integrate ADRD research into my
existing research portfolio; 2. To develop scientific protocols to study cognitive prehabilitation for older KT
recipients; and 3. To establish a national renal aging research network that will collaborate on new research
and mentor junior faculty. By replacing administrative duties with protected time, the K02 mechanism will allow
me to achieve my long-term career goal of establishing a sustainable research program focused on physical
and cognitive aging among KT patients. I will take full advantage of what the K02 Independent Scientist
mechanism offers: training in ADRD research, developing a sustainable research infrastructure, and ultimately
impacting the lives of the 100,000 patients who experience physical and cognitive decline while waiting for KT."

solutions for robust and efficient QA of modern RT. Specifically, we aim to (i) establish a novel
framework for using deep learning to verify the machine delivery parameters of an RT treatment plan; (ii)
investigate the use of deep learning for RT dose verification; and (iii) evaluate the performance of the QA
system and show its potential clinical impact
. This research presents the first-of-its-kind treatment plan
QA strategy capable of providing both machine delivery parameters (MLC apertures and MUs of the
involved IMRT/VMAT fields) and dosimetric distribution on the patient’s treatment geometry. The
research will also make it possible to take advantage of the useful features of both deep learning models
from Aims 1 and 2 and check the cycle-consistency of a treatment plan (i.e., from the beam parameters of
the plan to the corresponding 3D dose distribution, and then from the 3D dose to the beam parameters)
for enhanced plan QA. Successful completion of the project will provide urgently needed plan QA tools
for safe, efficient and high-quality RT practice, and enable patients to truly benefit from modern RT
modalities. Finally, the proposed strategy is quite broad and can be readily generalized for QA of other
treatment modalities, such as proton therapy and high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy."

Hypoglycemia is a common and preventable complication of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes (T2D)
that increases dramatically with age. In older adults (age ≥ 75), hypoglycemia accounts for 20% of all
Emergency Department admissions for adverse drug events (primarily due to insulin). Hypoglycemic
episodes in older adults are also associated with increased incidence of fall-related fractures,
cardiovascular events, cognitive decline and dementia, hospitalization, worse self-reported quality of
life, and mortality. For patients with T2D requiring insulin, optimal dosing requires monitoring glucose
levels and directional trends in the context of insulin type and dose, diet, physical activity, health status,
and symptoms. Severe hypoglycemia can occur at any time when the insulin regimen does not match
the corresponding patient needs. In older patients, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
using traditional fingerstick checks are often not physically possible (nor desirable). Moreover, many
older patients with long duration T2D have hypoglycemia unawareness (a potent risk factor for severe
hypoglycemia) and/or fear of hypoglycemia (with corresponding reluctance to inject full insulin dose).
The overarching goal of this R01 research proposal is to support safer management of insulin-requiring,
older adults (age ≥ 75) with T2D at high risk of severe hypoglycemia. We will test the hypothesis that in
these high-risk older adults with T2D, a group-based educational program that incorporates alarm-
enabled continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will reduce the incidence of severe hypoglycemia as
defined by the American Diabetes Association as requiring active assistance from another person to
administer resuscitative measures. AIM 1: We will conduct a 3-arm randomized, pragmatic clinical trial
designed to test the efficacy of two intervention strategies, Arm 1 – Patient-only and Arm 2 - Patient +
Pharmacist compared to Arm 3 – Usual Care within a large, integrated care delivery system (Kaiser
Permanente Northern California). This 3-arm design allows us to examine the impact of two versions of
CGM-based program implementation that require different levels of health system investment (i.e.,
patient-education and training with or without added clinical personnel). AIM 2: We will also examine
heterogeneity of intervention treatment effects by clinical context (baseline glycemic control, concurrent
comorbidity) and patient context (age, health literacy) to inform future adaptation and dissemination
strategies. This safety-oriented intervention strategy incorporating alarm-enabled CGM provides the
potential for a low-burden approach to helping high-risk patients reduce incidence of severe
hypoglycemia. If successful, the RCT evidence from this study will support new models of care
designed to improve patient safety and patient-centered outcomes for older adults with T2D."

Overview of Research: The Van Horn lab primarily focuses on elucidating and understanding the molecular
mechanisms that underlie membrane protein function in health and disease. To achieve these goals, the
laboratory employs a modern state-of-the-art and interdisciplinary approach using biophysical, structural,
computational, and functional techniques. We are experts in membrane protein biophysics and make use of
advanced NMR studies combined with functional whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. These orthogonal
data are linked with Rosetta-based computational techniques to understand protein function. Our primary target
is the TRPM8 ion channel which was initially identified as an oncogene that is prognostic for some types of
cancer progression. More recently, it has become a focus for therapeutic intervention in pain and obesity.
Complicating the potential application of TRPM8 therapies is that it is a molecular integrator that is activated by
a number of diverse stimuli. For example, TRPM8 is the primary human cold sensor but is also activated by the
chemical menthol from mint, both of which activate TRPM8 signaling networks. The ability to respond to several
different stimuli in a polymodal manner makes TRPM8 studies crucial to delineate the independence and
interdependence of molecular mechanisms that result in biological function and complicate its therapeutic
targeting. In addition to direct stimulation by cold and menthol, TRPM8 is regulated by diverse proteins, including
the membrane protein, PIRT, which in turn modulates TRPM8 activation by cold, menthol, and other stimuli.
 Beyond our research on direct activation of TRPM8 by cold and menthol, we focus on determining the
mechanisms whereby PIRT modulates TRPM8 function. This has led to a number of contributions from our lab
including, biophysical and structural characterization of TRPM8 and PIRT, TRPM8–PIRT complex stoichiometry,
identification of species-dependent regulation, and central insight into molecular regulatory mechanisms. These
efforts have led to strong scientific output, including publications, seminars, and patents.
Five-year Goals: Broadly defined, we will identify how TRPM8 is directly activated by cold temperatures and
other stimuli, map the allosteric networks that allow for polymodal function, and determine structures of TRPM8
and related membrane protein complexes of functional consequence.
Research Vision: In the past 8 years, there has been an explosion of TRP channel structural biology with now
~100 discrete TRP channel structures. This represents tremendous development and output. Our research
seeks to extend and complement the structural momentum to delineate fundamental mechanistic properties such
as allostery, dynamics, and protein complex regulation that determines function. These TRPM8 outcomes are
anticipated to have direct impacts on human health and disease but also to serve as a template that defines and
identifies fundamental rules and properties of membrane protein function."
10793478,"The overall objective of this project is to establish how infant diet with different protein-rich foods regulate growth trajectories and gut microbiota development. Both NIH and USDA are now addressing the urgent need for evidence-based dietary guidance early in life, particularly regarding protein intake, but a significant knowledge gap exists in the effects of protein-rich foods on growth and development during early complementary feeding. Early complementary feeding (~5 to 12 months of age), when infants start to consume foods beyond breastmilk or formula, is a critical transition period of developmental plasticity. Growth trajectories and shifts of the gut microbiota during this critical period have the potential to program long-term body weight, composition and disease risks and are greatly influenced by diet. Preliminary data from our pilot study in formula-fed infants demonstrated that consuming diets with two protein-rich foods: meat and dairy at a high-intake level, resulted in distinctive growth patterns from 5 to 12 months of age. An important new preliminary finding was that meat- and dairy-based foods directly affected gut microbiota diversity, composition and short-chain fatty acid production at 12 months. Changes in gut microbiota composition were also associated with infant linear growth (length gain). Here we propose three specific aims to determine how the introduction of common protein-rich foods impact infant growth (Aim 1), the development of gut microbiota (Aim 2) and the relationship between gut microbiota and infant growth (Aim 3), in a randomized controlled trial. Healthy, term infants (n=300) will be recruited and randomized to meat-, dairy-, plant-based diet groups or the reference group (standard of care), from 5 to 12 months. We will use controlled feeding (all foods provided, and formula if needed) with longitudinal assessments of gut microbiota, infant growth, blood biomarkers (IGF-1, IGFBP3, insulin, amino acids, lipids, etc.), dietary intakes, body composition, and total energy expenditure. Our multi-disciplinary team is ideally positioned to conduct this project, with collective expertise in pediatric nutrition, human clinical trials, microbiome, biostatistics, and a long-standing record of collaboration. Findings are expected to have significant scientific and health implications for determining dietary patterns that promote optimal infant growth and identifying gut microbial changes that are beneficial to the host metabolism and growth during early complementary feeding. The results of the study will also support evidence-based dietary recommendations in infants to prevent the risk of overweight and later obesity."

Type 2 diabetes is a significant health disparity for many American Indian (AI) communities. The goal of this
competitive renewal research is to enhance, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally tailored,
intergenerational diabetes management and prevention intervention, “Together on Diabetes.” The program
activates family and cultural practices that encourage healthy diets and physical activities, promote stress-
coping resources and responses, and reconnect families via a home-based intervention taught by AI
paraprofessional Family Health Coaches. The proposed Community Based Participatory Research will enroll
“target” adult caregivers diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their children, ages 10-16 years, with the goal of
tapping into motivational reciprocity between the two generations. The work builds on an existing research
collaboration with five Ojibwe tribal communities in the Midwest to implement a randomized controlled study (N
= 280 families) with a wait-list design respectful of cultural norms of inclusion. The study will evaluate
effectiveness of the intervention on adult physiological (primary outcome = HbA1c), behavioral, and mental
health and children's psychosocial, familial, behavioral and physiological risk and protective factors for
diabetes. The research will also identify stress-coping mechanisms that mediate the impact of the intervention
on health. A novel collaborative, qualitative evaluation technique will map potential “ripple effects” of the
intervention within families and communities. If effective, the intervention will promote dissemination and
scaling with tribal health coaches, community involvement, and stakeholder (health providers, health and
human service agencies) input."

 Many women struggle with infertility with only around 30% of pregnancies progressing to live birth and
the remainder failing through spontaneous abortions, the majority of which are associated with
aneuploidy. Here we use a mouse model for mosaic aneuploidy to study the effects of chromosome
mosaicism on development of the conceptus through the pre-, peri-and early post-implantation stages.
We have previously shown that aneuploidy results in two different responses in different adjacent tissues
of the pre-implantation embryo: cell cycle delay in the extra-embryonic trophectoderm that will establish
the placenta and apoptosis in the inner cell mass that will establish the foetus. We will now determine
the fate of the majority of aneuploid cells that persist into implantation stages and how, in many cases,
these can be eliminated without compromising implantation morphogenesis and the associated
transition in the state of pluripotency. We will determine the extent to which the embryo can compensate
for lost aneuploid cells to ensure development and determine the mechanisms employed by different
post-implantation tissues to cope with aneuploidy and protect the pluripotent lineage that generates all
germ layers and germline. As studies in diverse organisms indicate that global gene expression and
translation levels correlate with the degree of aneuploidy, we will determine whether aneuploidy in the
embryo results in proteomic imbalance leading to a common set of proteotoxic stress responses that
induce autophagy. We will elucidate the role of autophagy in the elimination of aneuploid cells from the
embryo and determine the roles of p53 and mTOR in this process. Our study will shed light onto
competition between aneuploid and diploid cells in development and will uncover new pathways that
regulate embryo growth and plasticity. It will inform IVF strategies in the clinic by building a working
knowledge of circumstances in which human embryos diagnosed as mosaic should or should not be
discarded. It will enable a more accurate assessment of the developmental potential of mosaic
aneuploid embryos and permit the development of better methods to assess the probability of successful
pregnancy."

The overall goal of the Vanderbilt Oncology Training Program (VOLT) is to prepare hematology and oncology
fellows and other trainees for careers conducting impactful cancer-related clinical, translational, and
population science. The objectives of VOLT are 1) to identify and recruit trainees to become top-tier junior
investigators in hematology and oncology by providing an advanced training experience, 2) to develop skills
that support this career, including communication, resiliency, team building, and grant management, and 3)
to educate trainees on the importance and incorporation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and
community outreach and engagement (COE) into their research and clinical practice. VOLT will accomplish
this by mentored clinical research in oncology and tailored didactics including Master’s degree programs.
Through regular meetings with the Program Directors, peer trainees, and mentorship committees, annual
retreats, as well as preparation of Individual Development Plans and structured Progress Reports, VOLT
trainees gain the skill set required for a successful oncology research career. VOLT has identified a diverse
group of 43 committed, experienced mentors across cancer-related disciplines. Trainees conduct mentored
research in three areas: 1) molecular oncology, 2) therapeutic development, tumor immunology, and
immunotherapy, and 3) bioinformatics, big data, and cancer outcomes. Trainees are recruited from medical
and pediatric hematology and oncology, or other cancer-related disciplines. VOLT is led by two physician
scientists, a medical oncologist who conducts translational research and a pediatric oncologist who conducts
population science and clinical research. An Internal Advisory Committee representing the diversity of VOLT
research evaluates prospective trainees, and monitors the progress of individual trainees and the program’s
success. Metrics for trainee and program evaluation include diversity of program participants, program
completion, retention in research-focused careers, funding success, publication, and impact. An External
Advisory Committee, composed of four physician-scientists, provides input into the scientific direction of
program, ensures it is meeting national workforce needs and cancer priorities, and monitors progress,
accomplishments, and trajectory to further programmatic advancement. Ongoing program evaluation has led
to improvements in trainee evaluation, minority recruitment strategies, training in DEI and COE and mentoring,
and changes in advisors and mentors to reflect greater diversity. Our 10 trainees have published 28
manuscripts since their appointment to VOLT. Four have received peer-reviewed grant support, and an
additional three have applications under review. Of the five trainees who have graduated, four continue in
research-intensive careers. In its first cycle, VOLT has been successful in developing trainees who will lead
cancer research and advance cancer care and is well poised to continue this trajectory."
10762402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of my laboratory is to characterize how molecular communication between bacteria and their
animal hosts leads to specific and reproducible colonization. To accomplish this goal, the laboratory studies the
Vibrio fischeri-squid system, in which the animal’s “light organ” is colonized exclusively by one bacterial
species. This system is advantageous because bacteria colonize through the natural route of infection, all
animals are colonized within three hours of bacterial inoculation into the seawater, the bacteria can be subject
to detailed genetic manipulation, the precise site of infection can be imaged directly in the live animal host, and
chemical analysis of the animal host enables detailed molecular investigations. Focusing on how squid are
reproducibly colonized by the specific symbiont, to the exclusion of the millions of competing bacteria in
seawater, has revealed key roles for bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation in promoting specific host-
microbe interactions. Questions that our group is asking include: (1) How does a symbiont regulate a
beneficial biofilm? Biofilms provide microbes with a protected environment in which they can act collectively
and resist innate immune insults and antimicrobial compounds. V. fischeri elaboration of a symbiotic biofilm is
required for entry into the host, providing an opportunity to study this process in the context of a natural host
colonization model. Our past work identified BinK as a key negative regulator of biofilm formation and the
planktonic-to-biofilm transition in the host. In this study, we examine how BinK interprets signals from the host
and how that information is transmitted to V. fischeri. We examine mechanisms of signal transduction and seek
to identify and characterize a ligand that regulates BinK activity. (2) What novel bacterial factors play critical
functions in colonization processes? We have had success in applying global genetic approaches to
identify bacterial colonization factors in V. fischeri. With a focus on novel and understudied bacterial genes for
which the V. fischeri-squid system has the potential to elucidate protein functions, we identified a protein that
has a substantial impact on biofilm formation and squid colonization. The protein is annotated as a putative
RNA-binding protein, and we will characterize the molecular mechanisms by which this protein acts and
determine how it impacts symbiotic biofilm formation. (3) How do small molecules influence microbiome
specificity and colonization? We have begun to identify compounds that are present in the host and that are
co-regulated with symbiotic behaviors. We will integrate genetic approaches to elucidate signaling pathways in
the context of host colonization. A major strength of the V. fischeri-squid system is the ability to interrogate
bacterial behavior in the intact animal host, and completion of these projects will enable a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms underlying animal colonization by beneficial microbes."

Chagas disease is caused by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, and affects millions of people in Latin America.
Lately, Chagas disease has become an emerging worldwide public health issue due to globalization. Chagas
disease has two phases: an initial acute phase, usually with nonspecific symptoms or asymptomatic, and a
lifelong chronic phase, which is clinically silent or indeterminate in 60-70% of patients. However, 30-40% of
chronic patients will eventually develop heart and/or digestive complications. Currently, the only approved
drugs for treating Chagas disease are benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX). The efficacy of these drugs is
variable and depends on the disease stage, drug dose, age of patients, and infecting T. cruzi strain(s).
Treatment in the acute phase is effective with both drugs. However, the efficacy of these drugs in adults with
chronic, long-established infections is significantly lower and variable. Moreover, the high rate of adverse
events of these drugs has hampered their regular clinical use, thus <1% of patients are being treated. In this
project, we propose to test four new dosing regimens of BZN and NFX. Our first hypothesis is that a lower
frequency of BZN and NFX dosing, with standard or extended treatment duration, might have the same or
better efficacy than the standard treatment regimens with these drugs, with fewer adverse events. Here, we
plan to analyze current and novel host- and parasite-derived BMKs that have shown promising results in pilot,
full clinical trials or in animal studies, providing a measure of disease state and cure. Thus, our second
hypothesis is that in those patients that respond to BZN or NFX treatment the serum levels of one or more
proposed BMKs will be significantly reduced or become negative within three years post-treatment. To test
these two hypotheses, we propose two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the safety and efficacy of
extended benznidazole or nifurtimox treatment regimens with lower dosing frequency. Specific Aim 2: To
evaluate host- and parasite-derived biomarkers for the follow-up of Chagas disease chemotherapy. The
information gained in this project would also allow for better-designed clinical trials with previously proposed
drug combinations, in which BZN and NFX would play a central role."

10812421,"SUMMARY
Destruction of deposited maternal transcripts is an essential step during early animal embryogenesis.
Together with production of new zygotic transcripts, this process is called the maternal-to-zygotic transition
(MZT) and enables the handover of developmental control from the maternal genome to the zygotic one.
mRNA destruction is triggered by shortening of the 3' poly(A) tail, and control of tail length is an important
post-transcriptional regulatory hub. However, we know little about the differences in poly(A)-tail lengths on
maternal and zygotic transcripts. We propose a “developmental priming” hypothesis to bridge this conceptual
gap: here, maternal transcripts experience oogenesis-specific poly(A)-tail shortening that leads to their
destruction during the MZT. Developmental priming thus provides a mechanism whereby maternal and
zygotic transcripts can be distinguished to enable the transfer of developmental control to the zygotic genome.
 In this proposal, we will test and explore this hypothesis using Drosophila as a model system. We will
first focus on a potential archetype of developmental priming: the maternal Sex lethal (Sxl) mRNA. Sxl is a
master regulator of sex determination and dosage compensation. Sex chromosome number leads to different
male and female Sxl transcript isoforms, and the female isoform sets off an auto-regulatory, feed-forward loop
that culminates in the maintenance of female identity. Importantly, the maternal (and thus female) Sxl mRNA
is deposited in the embryo and must be removed lest it override the zygotic sex chromosome composition
and lead to all embryos being specified as “female.” However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. We
propose that the removal of maternal Sxl mRNA can be explained by developmental priming. In Aim 1, we
will explore this model: during oogenesis the RNA-binding protein Bruno leads to short poly(A) tails on
maternal Sxl mRNA and so primes them for destruction. In Aim 2, we will extend our hypothesis transcriptome-
wide using a new approach that combines SNP-based allele detection with long-read sequencing to determine
the poly(A)-tail lengths on maternal and zygotic transcripts. This second aim is exploratory and perfectly suited
to the R21 mechanism.
 We expect our proposed research to make several significant contributions. First, it will provide an
answer to a decades-old mystery about Sxl regulation during embryogenesis. Second, through our
experiments in Aim 2, we will create high-quality long-read sequencing datasets spanning the Drosophila
MZT. Third, we will develop a new experimental and computational tool that can use long-read sequencing
to look at allele-specific regulation, which will enable future mechanistic experiments. Finally, it will provide a
new conceptual framework for understanding the specific clearance of maternal transcripts, which will form
the basis for future studies and grants. This intellectual framework will likely prove useful for understanding
how old transcripts can be specifically regulated at other developmental transitions."

T-cells play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of GVHD which remains a major barrier for the successful
application of HSCT for a wide range of benign and hematologic malignancies. GVHD involvement of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The composition of the GI
microbiome is associated with onset and severity of GVHD, though current understanding of how specific
microbial species contribute to GVHD pathogenesis remains largely correlative with limited mechanistic
insights. While the microbiome acts as a major source of cognate antigen for T cells, little is known about how
anti-microbial TCRs may contribute to pathology in this setting. Part of the difficulty in parsing out the
alloreactive response from immune surveillance on a clonal level includes the vast combinatorial diversity of αβ
TCRs, the high prevalence of low copy number TCRs in any given donor pool, and sampling limitations. The
foundation of this proposal is based on preliminary studies using a novel computational algorithm to identify
expanded donor TCRs that are not constrained by donor and host genetics, but rather appear to be influenced
by commensal microbes.
How exactly these anti-microbial TCRs might function in the post-transplant context and its physiological
relevance to GVHD are questions that this proposal begins to address. More specifically, the aims of this
proposal are to 1) Validate computationally identified anti-microbial CD4+ TCRs in an scRNA seq platform and
define cellular phenotypes in relation to compartment localization, 2) Reconstruct computationally identified
CD4+ TCRs and determine antigenic specificity through genomic screening, and 3) Dissect the functional role
of identified anti-microbial CD4+ TCRs on the propagation of acute graft-vs-host disease. The scientific
objective of this proposal is to examine the drivers of clonotypic T-cell expansion following allogeneic stem cell
transplant and assess how the pathogenesis of GVHD is coupled to microbial surveillance."

Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex chronic condition associated with
prolonged inflammatory signaling. Long Covid/Post-Acute Sequelae of Covid (PASC) has been noted as a
relatively common outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and appears to mirror many of the features of ME/CFS,
suggesting that the etiology of these conditions might be shared [1, 2]. Neutrophils are the most common immune
cells in the circulation and are exquisitely sensitive to changes in inflammatory signaling. We have developed a
unique panel of microfluidic assays that probe neutrophil function from a drop of fresh blood. We recently used
these assays on fresh fingerpick blood obtained from 6 ICC-diagnosed ME/CFS subjects and 1 PASC subject
and found preliminary evidence that multiple neutrophil functions were altered in ME/CFS relative to
progression of disease. Strikingly, the PASC subject exhibited changes in neutrophil function most similar to
early-stage ME/CFS. The goal of our project is to use these microfluidic assays to probe neutrophil function in
a larger cohort of ICC-ME/CFS, PASC subjects, and healthy controls. We will characterize neutrophil motility
and extracellular trap formation (NETosis) from a drop of fresh blood, both at baseline and following in vitro
stimulation, in all subjects. We will also use an established panel to characterize proinflammatory cytokines in
ME/CFS, PASC, and healthy control subject blood collected at the same time as the neutrophil fingerprick
samples. This will determine if proinflammatory cytokine burden will correlate with neutrophil motility and baseline
NETosis across groups. An overarching aim of the proposal is to analyze neutrophil responses as a function of
illness duration in both ME/CFS and PASC. Characterization of neutrophil behavior in relatively recent-onset
PASC will lay the groundwork for future longitudinal studies of this condition and will help determine the
mechanistic overlap with ME/CFS or lack thereof."
10788327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of this proposal is to support the candidate’s career development and transition to that of
an independent researcher. The outlined training plan will equip the applicant with the necessary skills to
conduct innovative research in a rich, interdisciplinary, and collaborative environment, facilitating the
investigation of new avenues of clinical research and trials. By utilizing multimodal imaging techniques and
molecular and cellular proteomic approaches, the candidate will reinforce an already strong background in
neuroimaging, learn and integrate new approaches to gain a greater holistic understanding of Alzheimer
disease (AD) etiology and pathophysiology, and contribute to the success of potential new therapies for AD. β-
amyloid (Aβ), one of the earliest biomarkers to accumulate during AD progression, is the most targeted factor
for therapeutic intervention. However, other components, such as vascular and inflammatory/immune changes,
also occur during AD progression, adding to the complexity of fully characterizing AD pathogenesis. The
neurovascular unit (NVU) is relevant to the study of vascular, immune, and Aβ changes in AD, as it comprises
neuronal-astrocyte signaling and the blood-brain barrier, which play a role in Aβ clearance. Age-related
comorbidities in late-onset AD (LOAD) are challenging to distinguish from AD-related changes involved in the
progression of the disease. This proposal aims to disconnect age- from disease-related changes to vascular
and immune components and to understand the impact of these disease-related changes on anti-Aβ treatment
outcomes. This will be accomplished by studying these factors in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), a rare form
of AD with a known genetic etiology and with early age of symptom onset. Previous studies utilizing proteomic
approaches and imaging to assess NVU disruption have focused on LOAD populations. The goal of Aim 1 of
this proposal is to assess changes in the NVU in known carriers of ADAD-related mutations and with markers
of vascular changes and generate a proteomic profile of NVU changes. The goal of Aim 2 is to define the
temporality and association of NVU disruption relative to other established markers of disease progression.
The goal of Aim 3 is to define the influence of NVU disruption on outcomes of Aβ clearance therapies, as well
as on the incidence of treatment side effects and the association with primary clinical and cognitive outcomes.
Successful completion of this proposed research project will improve our understanding of the vascular- and
immune-related processes involved in AD and their relationship with Aβ, the pathophysiology of AD, and their
influence on treatment-related Aβ changes."

Background and Knowledge Gap: Unraveling life's intracellular processes at single molecule (SM) spatiotem-
poral scales is critical toward monitoring therapeutic agents and developing disease diagnostics. Yet drawing
insight on biomolecular events at such scales presents profound challenges to existing ﬂuorescence imaging.
Fundamentally, this arises due to the model selection problem: unavoidable (quantum, thermal, detector) noise
at the SM scale means that the data cannot easily be used to resolve “models"" such as the number of molecules
located within a small region of space. An experimental solution toward resolving this problem earned the 2014
Chemistry Nobel prize though such solutions necessarily come at a cost. Either spatial or temporal resolution is
compromised while samples are often irradiated over extended durations inducing sample photodamage.
Recent Progress: Thanks to having reached the funding midpoint of both our NIGMS R01s, we developed
mathematical tools allowing us to mitigate, sometimes dramatically, spatial (R01GM130745) and temporal (R01
GM134426) compromises of existing experimental solutions to model selection. Our work has resulted in 10
publications, 15 collaborations, and 18 ongoing projects. Here are just 3 projects: 1) in recent publications,
we derived SM properties using 2-3 orders of magnitude fewer photons than would normally be used to obtain
bulk properties from ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS); 2) in accepted work, we provide a means
to determine protein cluster stoichiometry (up to hundreds of subunits) eliminating the requirement to control
ﬂuorescent label properties; 3) in work about to be submitted, we track with equal accuracy and precision about
an order of magnitude more labeled molecules as winners of the Nature Methods tracking competition.
Overview of Future Work: We've organized our future work as extensions of both R01's, projects merging both
R01's and directions beyond both. Brieﬂy, to extend existing R01's, we will: 1) provide the ﬁrst direct single-
photon analysis of single molecule ﬂuorescence resonant energy transfer (smFRET) data that simultaneously
learns the number of states of biomolecules even lifting the assumption of discrete states. We will apply this,
for example, to the unresolved rotational and translational dynamics of a transcription factor to DNA; 2) seek
computational solutions to aberration and illumination artifacts that can dramatically deteriorate our ability to
reliably track molecules intracellularly. In doing so, we will provide a computational alternative to adaptive optics
and apply our tools to the trafﬁcking and silencing activity of microRNAs often located deep within the cellular
nucleus. As we merge both R01's: we hope to track reaction-diffusion events of many molecules, resolved at the
SM level, and apply them toward understanding heterogeneous interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins.
Beyond both R01s: we will borrow Mathematics from SM to resolve the dynamics of a bacterial predator, a
candidate living antibiotic, as it hunts for its prey (E. coli) within the gut of c. elegans. Finally, we propose to
generalize refractive index (RI) mapping and structured illumination analyses currently limited to slow dynamics."
10793477,"Over the past 50 years, the field of biophysical chemistry has learned an enormous
amount about the relationships between the function, dynamics and folding of soluble proteins. The next stage in biological science involves addressing more complex problems on more challenging systems using increasingly sophisticated approaches augmented by computational methods. The Sosnick lab has followed this path. We are conducting studies of membrane proteins, condensates and disordered proteins. Our ability to address these topics arises in part from our expertise in the folding of soluble and more recently, membrane proteins. We build on this experience and knowledge to advance new or improve existing methods. The proposed research relies heavily on hydrogen exchange (HX), a method developed to study folding and dynamics yet possessing broad transferability to many methods. We plan to continue this approach and study the metabolite transport across a bilayer, stress-induced phase separation,
and properties of disordered proteins in addition to membrane protein folding. Many of
the projects are collaborative, leveraging our skills and interests with those of other labs,
which further supports the value of our studies."
10775711,"The overarching goal of our laboratory is to understand how cells process signals and communicate robustly in
complex environments. We combine experiments, modeling, and development of technologies for high-
throughput single-cell analysis. Here, we build upon two grants that proposed fundamental (R01GM128042) and
technological (R01GM127527) studies of immune signaling. Our goals are integrated around two key questions:
 How do cells encode information into signaling molecules? Environmental inputs are detected by
sentinel cells, which in response produce cytokines. Recent studies led to the hypothesis that cytokine dynamics
encode information from the environment. Determining how pathogen and stress inputs are encoded is crucial
for understanding infection, autoimmunity, sepsis and cancer. We will use single-cell protein production/secretion
assays and live-cell analysis to answer key questions including: How do cells exposed to multiple sequential
stimuli encode the memory of prior stimuli? How does cellular density and coordination influence cytokine
responses? What are the mechanisms of cytokine production variability by myeloid or epithelial cells, and what
causes excessive cytokine production/secretion? Technologies to analyze single-cell protein
production/secretion: We will realize a method for simultaneous measurement of single-cell expressed
proteins, protein complexes and mRNA using single-cell sequencing readout. High-throughput microfluidic
technologies for time-dependent measurement of proteins secreted by single live-cells will be developed. We
will also develop microfluidic co-culture systems for creating controlled dynamic microenvironments.
 How do cells process combinatorial/dynamic signals? Signals generated by sentinel cells are processed
by transcriptional pathways. NF-κB, an inflammatory pathway that controls responses to many signals, is a prime
example of a system that creates fine-tuned responses. We will study NF-κB as a model system to answer key
questions in signal processing in single-cells: How does NF-κB process combinatorial signals? During infection,
immunity and stress, cells are exposed to combinations and temporal sequences of multiple cytokines. How NF-
κB processes such inputs is not understood. How does NF-κB dynamics regulate gene expression in space and
time? While much attention has been given to temporal characteristics of signaling, little is known about how NF-
κB decodes signals propagating over different spatial scales. How do single cells/populations respond to
dynamic (increasing, decreasing, oscillating) inputs? High-throughput live-cell analysis technologies: To
better answer these and other general questions in signaling, we will develop broadly applicable live-cell analysis
technologies: We will develop microfluidic systems that culture, track and analyze single-cells and populations
under predetermined dynamic/combinatorial signals. We will develop microfluidic technologies for spatial
analysis of live cells and cell signaling events. We will develop computational/statistical methods for automated
analysis for image segmentation, cell/organoid tracking, and prediction of cellular outcomes."
10932100,"Project Summary
 Membrane proteins regulate the cellular processes by which all organisms survive. Due to this crucial
role, membrane proteins are 60% of drug targets. However, improvements to drug design are often impeded
by open questions about their mechanisms. A fundamental function of membrane proteins is to transduce
information across the membrane by encoding the presence of stimuli in their conformation. Therefore,
knowledge of their conformations is required for the missing mechanistic understanding. However, high-
resolution structural methods are often limited to individual domains and/or non-native conditions. In contrast,
fluorescence-based single-molecule methods are amenable to physiological environments, yet can lack the
spatial or temporal resolution required for key conformational changes. Our laboratory recently introduced new
methods to improve the temporal resolution of single-molecule spectroscopy and, in the proposed work, will
improve the spatial resolution. Investigations into transmembrane behaviors require the full-length protein
structure, and thus its native membrane environment. Therefore, we have also developed robust protocols to
solubilize membrane proteins from bacteria, plants, and mammals within discoidal lipid bilayers, known as
nanodiscs. In initial studies, we used single-molecule spectroscopy and nanodiscs to reveal ligand-induced
transmembrane conformational changes for two important receptors, the mammalian epidermal growth factor
and the bacterial sugar chemoreceptor Tar. We are now primed to follow the propagation of ligand-induced
conformational changes through the receptors and how these changes are controlled by the complex
composition and organization of the plasma membrane.
 Altogether, this NIGMS MIRA application seeks to merge two of my laboratory's primary interests: (1)
Developing and applying advanced single-molecule methods for molecular-level insight into protein machinery;
and (2) Isolating and interrogating full-length membrane proteins in a near native environment using nanodiscs.
Through this combination, we open a window into transmembrane conformational changes and the role of
these conformations in cellular processes. Our contributions will impact fields ranging from single-molecule
biophysics to cancer biology to microbial signaling."

Indian-origin rhesus macaques are a premier model for AIDS research, but current research demand far exceeds
supply. This has been exasperated by the COVID-19 pandemic, where rhesus have proved again to be a vital
model for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. This project will help alleviate this shortage by the
production of Indian-origin, specific pathogen free (SPF) rhesus macaques prioritized for AIDS-related research
that are well characterized by genotype and phenotype. Using established methods, we will utilize genomic,
behavioral, and demographic data to optimally compose and monitor rhesus breeding groups. We will also
increase the size of our rhesus colony via an increase in the number of female breeders, institutionally supported
acquisition of additional macaques for breeding and/or research purposes, and occupation of newly renovated
areas for rhesus production. We will continue to provide rhesus for AIDS-related and other approved NIH

efficiency of the SNPRC SPF breeding colony by genetically and reproductively managing it in concert with the
MHC Genetic Typing Core and Specific Aim 2: grow the U42 Colony towards an approximate steady state of
1000 animals, at which time approximately 150 rhesus macaques will be made available for AIDS research

10869859,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Miscarriage is the most frequent pregnancy complication, and around
750,000 to 1,000,000 miscarriages occur annually in the United States. Up to five percent of couples will
experience two or more miscarriages and have recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). RPL is a significant clinical
problem as even after a diagnostic workup, 50% of couples will not find a cause for their recurrent losses and
will be diagnosed with unexplained RPL (uRPL). Therefore, investigating new causes for RPL is crucial to help
couples with RPL to identify a cause and, therefore, possible therapeutic options. Male factor causes of uRPL
are understudied, and clinically, the only diagnostic testing performed on men with uRPL is a karyotype to
exclude chromosomal translocation/inversion. Our proposal is highly significant as it addresses this major gap
in our knowledge regarding paternal causes of RPL. Several lines of evidence show that abnormal sperm
quality as objectively measured by high DNA fragmentation and aberrant DNA methylation in imprinted genes
is associated with uRPL. This project will shift the present clinical diagnostic paradigm for RPL couples from a
mainly female-centric approach to a balanced approach, including molecular analysis of sperm. Our project will
involve a comprehensive analysis of sperm from a large cohort of uRPL couples to study DNA fragmentation
(Aim 1), DNA methylation (Aim 2), and histone patterns (Aim 3). In Aim 1, our experiments will investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which increased sperm DNA fragmentation in humans can lead to RPL by
investigating the type of DNA damage occurring and the genomic loci affected. One major innovation in our
approach is to uniquely study in parallel the genome of the miscarriages resulting from high DNA fragmented
sperm to elucidate the underlying defect. Although sperm genomic integrity is one crucial aspect of ensuring a
healthy pregnancy, another aspect is the sperm epigenome, which also plays a crucial role in pregnancy
viability. Prior studies show that sperm DNA methylation at imprinted loci is perturbed in men with uRPL, and
increased retention of histones in sperm from uRPL men has been observed. Building upon these
observations, in aim 2, we will pursue both a candidate (imprinted genes) and an unbiased genome-wide
approach to studying the sperm methylome using the latest comprehensive DNA methylation array technology.
In addition, we will also leverage a prior predictive model using DNA methylation as a marker of paternal aging
to assess if there is premature aging in the sperm from uRPL men. This work will identify epimutations in
sperm that could play a mechanistic role in RPL. In aim 3, we will expand our epigenetic analysis to perform a
genome-wide analysis of sperm histone patterns in uRPL men. Finally, we will combine our multi-omics
datasets to compare and contrast the genomic loci affected. In summary, this project will contribute
significantly to identifying novel male factor causes of RPL, which will ultimately lead to significant
advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of couples with RPL."
10765725,"Project Summary / Abstract
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, leading to disability and death
for individuals, and significant costs for caregivers and society. Cognitive impairment is a common cause of
functional impairment in PD and a central feature of the related disorder Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). To
date, there are no disease-modifying therapies to prevent the development or progression of these symptoms.
In both PD and DLB, intraneuronal inclusions of the protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in limbic and cortical regions
correlates with cortical hypometabolism, hallucinations, and progression to dementia, suggesting a central role
for α-syn in cognitive impairment. However, the specific effects and mechanisms by which α-syn pathology
impacts the function of cortical neurons and circuits remain unknown. In addition, the cortex exhibits regional
vulnerability, both to the deposition of α-syn and to the degree of functional impairment, for unknown reasons.
Thus, major gaps remain in our understanding of how cortical circuits become dysfunctional in PD and DLB and
how specific features of cortical circuits impact the spread and accumulation of α-syn. Here, Dr. Zeiger will lead
a research group to test the hypothesis that a reciprocal relationship exists between α-syn pathology and
neuronal activity, such that cortical α-syn accumulation directly disrupts neuronal activity, and conversely, that
changes in neuronal activity influence the progression of α-syn pathology. In Aim 1, Dr. Zeiger’s group will use
a novel model system in a mouse model of PD to directly define how α-syn impacts the function of different
disease-relevant cortical circuits. Innovative longitudinal two-photon imaging methods will be used to
simultaneously monitor neuronal activity and the accumulation of α-syn inclusions with single-cell resolution.
This will then be correlated with behavioral studies to better understand how α-syn-mediated circuit dysfunction
leads to cognitive and motor symptoms. The impact of co-existing Alzheimer’s disease amyloid-beta pathology
on α-syn-mediated circuit dysfunction will also be tested. In Aim 2, Dr. Zeiger’s group will test the hypothesis that
changes in activity can increase or decrease the accumulation of α-syn in the cortex. Advanced transgenic
mouse lines and viral tools will be used to specifically manipulate the activity of different components of
corticostriatal circuits to define how the activity of specific sub-populations of neurons contribute to the
progression of PD pathology. Together, these studies will uncover basic mechanisms about how cortical circuits
are affected in PD and DLB. This information is also of great importance for future translational studies aiming
to use therapeutic neuromodulation to treat symptoms arising from cortical circuit dysfunction or potentially even
slow disease progression in PD and DLB."

problem and efficacious solutions by mentoring the next generation of innovative scientists committed to the
search for answers. Under the auspices of the UTMB Center for Addiction Research (CAR), the history of our
Training Program demonstrates a wealth of career development successes, extensive collaborative networks,
and expertise in cross-disciplinary SUD research conducted with contemporary technologies. Currently, 56% of
our mentees are females, while 50% are URM mentees; 12% of our mentees self-disclosed as SGM or persons
with disabilities or disadvantaged backgrounds. Our T32 mentors include 50% women with 19% having URM
status. During the current funding period, 95% of our mentees were retained in research positions with ~74% in
SUD-related careers. Together, pre- and postdoctoral mentees generated a total of 140+ publications in the past
10 years (36 during the current funding period with numerous manuscripts in progress). Our predoctoral mentees
are producing, on average, six published manuscripts each (two as first-author). Of our postdoctoral mentees
from the current funding period, three have become faculty, two are in residency programs, one is in industry.
Moving forward, our goal is to provide mentees with key transferrable skills accessible through innovative SUD
mechanistic studies, drug discovery projects, prevention, and public health initiatives. We will harness Health
Analytics to accomplish this goal by incorporating research strategies across barriers towards biobehavioral
signatures of SUDs. Our objectives are to (1) integrate diverse mentees into SUD research; (2) instill mastery of
SUD sciences and key skills through outstanding role models; (3) impart critical thinking skills to tackle strategic
questions in our field; (4) provide first-rate preparation for independent careers in SUD sciences; (5) inculcate
best practices in scientific ethics, rigor, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across the full spectrum of
possibilities; (6) broaden the dissemination of our learnings though peer-reviewed publications and community
venues to improve public health, productivity, and life fulfillment. Strategies to achieve these objectives include
providing well-funded, state-of-the-art research opportunities, facilities, effective mentoring plans (Mentor
Mosaics), challenging curricula, supportive interactive programs (e.g., SciPopUp, short-term research rotations),
plus first-rate activities that develop the professional skills needed for advancement towards an independent
career (e.g., Grant and Publication Action Group, Innovation and Entrepreneurship). The outcome of our efforts
is successful, diverse trainees as complete scientists equipped with the tools to advance the mechanistic
knowledge of SUDs as well as deliver new approaches to alleviate the challenges with drug misuse and SUDs."
10774202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A rotator cuff tendon tear affects up to 64% of adults, resulting in muscular changes that drive functional
disability and poor clinical outcomes. Rotator cuff tears are associated with muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration
(accrual of fat in the muscle bulk), non-homogenous distribution of fatty infiltration within the muscle, and
reduced muscle strength and contractile function. Changes to muscle morphology likely have a negative effect
on the muscle’s architecture (number and organization of muscle fibers) and the mechanical properties
dictating the muscle’s overall force-generating capacity. However, little is known about the mechanisms linking
muscle structure and function or how these associations change over time, exposing a notable knowledge
gap. Establishing the structure-function associations of muscle after rotator cuff tear will expose the targets
and key time points for design of treatments to improve outcomes for patients with a rotator cuff tear. Thus, the
objective of this project is to determine the spatial and temporal changes to muscle morphology, architecture,
and multi-scale mechanics after rotator cuff tear and surgical repair, and develop a predictive model to identify
the mechanisms driving biomechanical function. To achieve this goal, longitudinal experimental assessments
will be performed in an established rabbit model; a novel computational model will also be developed based on
experimental structural measurements of muscle to further probe the mechanisms of muscle function.
Specifically, this project aims to: 1) Establish the structure-function relationships of muscle after rotator cuff
tear and surgical repair; and 2) Develop and test a predictive model to examine mechanisms driving reduced
biomechanical function after rotator cuff tear. A rotator cuff tear will be surgically introduced in rabbits by blunt
dissection of the supraspinatus tendon, with assessments at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after injury; surgical repair
will be performed 8 weeks after injury, with a final assessment 8 weeks after repair. At each time point, muscle
morphology and architecture, and intra- versus extra-cellular location of lipid accumulation will be quantified
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multi-scale mechanics will be assessed at whole muscle and single
fiber levels. Structure-function associations and how these associations change over time will be established.
Structural measures of muscle morphology, architecture, and mechanics will be used to develop and test a
predictive model to probe the mechanistic role of each structural parameter on biomechanical function. Models
will be used to determine the mechanism and timing that should be targeted by treatment to improve functional
outcomes. This work is significant because it will establish the structure-function relationship of muscle after
rotator cuff tear and surgical repair and identify the mechanisms underpinning biomechanical function. Little
work has examined both spatial and temporal changes to muscle structure and examined their influence on
function, making this work innovative. Study outcomes will expand our understanding of the impact of rotator
cuff tear and drive development of novel treatments for the rotator cuff tear patient population."

Endothelial cells line the wall of all blood vessels and regulate a wide variety of functions, including contractility
which controls systemic blood pressure. Dysfunctional endothelial cells are a hallmark of several
cardiovascular diseases, but pathological mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Endothelial cells
express both PKD1 (polycystin-1), an eleven transmembrane domain protein, and PKD2 (polycystin-2), a
transient receptor potential (TRP) channel. Regulatory mechanisms, physiological functions and pathological
involvement during hypertension of PKD1 protein and PKD2 channels in endothelial cells are unclear. Using a
wide variety of approaches and inducible, endothelial cell-specific knockout mice, we provide evidence that
physical coupling of PKD1 to PKD2 in endothelial cells stimulates vasodilation. Preliminary data also suggest
that PKD1/PKD2 channel signaling is dysfunctional during hypertension, which attenuates this vasodilatory
signaling mechanism. In this proposal, we will investigate three specific aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that endothelial-dependent physiological stimuli activate PKD1/PKD2 coupling in endothelial cells, leading to
vasodilation. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms by which endothelial-dependent stimuli activate
PKD1/PKD2 channels in endothelial cells to produce vasodilation. Aim 3 will study the hypothesis that
hypertension is associated with pathological alterations in PKD1/PKD2 channel signaling in endothelial cells
that inhibits vasodilation mediated by these proteins. Methods used will include RT-PCR, Western blotting,
biotinylation, FRET, RNAi, co-IP, immunofluorescence, patch-clamp electrophysiology, membrane potential
recording, intracellular Ca2+ imaging, arterial myography and blood pressure telemetry. This project will
provide significant novel information concerning vasoregulation by endothelial cell PKD1 and PKD2 proteins."

St. Louis at the level of ten trainees, equal to our current level of support. The mission of our IMSD program is
to increase the matriculation, training, retention, graduation, and career outcomes of outstanding PhD students
from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences in order to help change the face of the next generation
of scientists and thus increase the power of the STEM workforce in the US.
Since its inception in 2013, our IMSD program has created 15 training elements that integrate seamlessly with
PhD student training and research, bolstering the academic, professional, and career success of essentially all
entering underrepresented (UR) PhD students and often all DBBS PhD students. Concentrated in years one to
three, these training activities span our students’ graduate careers and focus on ensuring they surpass defined
academic milestones, learn to think critically and to write and speak effectively about research, develop strong
student support networks, explore career options, and can engage in community-based educational outreach
activities. Since their creation, these activities and our IMSD Program have helped reduce and of late appear to
have eliminated the previously persistent achievement gap between URM and well-represented students in
terms of qualifying exam success and PhD student retention/completion.
Our new IMSD Program will welcome all entering UR DBBS PhD students into it, ensuring that it remains the
epicenter of academic, scientific, and career support for UR students in DBBS. We propose to support students
for their first two years of graduate school and will preferentially select students who have overcome significant
hardship for support. Over its nine-year history, our current IMSD program has increased UR student success
and serves as the foundation for our new IMSD program. By focusing on excellence and innovation in graduate
education and community-building, our new program will accelerate the tradition of scientific excellence in the
US by increasing the presence and success of diverse scientists in our PhD programs and ultimately in the
STEM workforce."
10767309,"Two key transcription factors, homeodomain protein CRX and basic leucine zipper protein NRL,
are at the center of gene regulation during photoreceptor differentiation and homeostasis. CRX is
essential for specifying commitment of postmitotic photoreceptor precursors to the development
of photoreceptor cells, whereas NRL determines the rod cell fate. In orchestrating the
transcriptional program of photoreceptor development, CRX and NRL cooperate functionally and
physically via a direct protein-protein interaction. Defects in photoreceptor transcriptional
regulation due to mutations in the genes encoding CRX and NRL cause severe retinal diseases
including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and Leber congenital amaurosis. Despite our
advanced understanding of the biology and transcriptional networks of CRX and NRL,
mechanistic insight into the functions and unique synergy of these transcription factors at the
atomic level is lacking. In the proposed studies, we seek to determine the crystal and solution
structures of the individual DNA-bound complexes of CRX and NRL, as well as the structure of
the ternary CRX/NRL/DNA complex. Although mutations in these TFs have been identified, they
have not been mechanistically linked to regulation of key genes. The mechanistic predictions from
the structures on how disease-causing mutations in CRX and NRL may alter DNA-binding
specificity at cis-regulatory elements will be validated in the follow-up assays, including high-
throughput approaches such as Spec-seq. These studies will enhance our knowledge of the
functions of CRX and NRL, define the molecular nature of their synergy, and allow us to delineate
specific mechanisms whereby mutant CRX and NRL proteins cause retinal diseases. We
hypothesize that ultimately the structures of CRX and NRL complexed with their cis-regulatory
elements will enable targeted design of therapeutics to treat visual disorders via modulation of
transcriptional activities at specific promoters."

clinical staff using PEWS (n=13 per center) during the phases of PEWS adoption, implementation,
and sustainability. Aim 2: We will determine the relationship between capacity and a) PEWS
sustainment and b) clinical deterioration mortality among pediatric oncology patients at centers
sustaining PEWS for 2 to 10 years using chart review and an existing patient outcomes registry. Aim
3: We will develop novel strategies to promote sustainability by gaining a deeper understanding of
perceived challenges to building capacity and PEWS sustainment. In combination with quantitative
outcomes, we will conduct 24 focus groups with hospital staff (doctors, nurses, and administrators)
from hospitals with both high (n=4) and low capacity (n=4). We will then use implementation mapping
to generate theoretically driven, empirically-supported strategies which promote sustainability. All
aims will be informed by an External Advisory Board and the EVAT steering committee.
Innovation and Impact: Few EB sustainability strategies exist for low-resource settings. This study will
advance implementation science by providing a theoretically-driven, foundational understanding of
factors that predict sustainability among a large, diverse cohort of low-resource hospitals. We will
then use this knowledge to develop sustainability strategies that optimize capacity and promote long-
term sustainment of PEWS and improvements in patient outcomes in low-resource settings -
ultimately promoting equity in childhood cancer care globally."
10800659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe vision loss affects ~40 million people worldwide1 and more as the population ages3. The success of sight
restoration and use of sensory aids for blind individuals depends on poorly-understood factors: some people do not
gain functional sight despite invasive procedures37-40. Mitigating this problem requires mapping the impacts of reduced
vision on the brain, which may preclude rehabilitation efforts. Following early-onset blindness, the visual cortex (VC)
undergoes plastic reorganization4-6,14,17 that may crucially affect its capacity to process restored vision and employ
compensatory strategies24. However, little effort has been made to understand the variability of brain reorganization
across blind individuals and its implications for sight restoration and compensatory abilities. Contributing to improved
individually-tailored visual rehabilitation, we propose to study multi-scale variability in the brains of blind individuals
using temporal, neurochemical, and spatial analyses of neuroimaging and behavioral data.
First, we will study if the blind VC retains a higher-than-typical plasticity potential with neurochemical and temporal
dynamics fMRI measures. Since visual experience in early development facilitates VC stabilization42,79, and short-term
dark exposure elicits plasticity41,80,81, we predict sustained plasticity in blind individuals. This would clarify mechanisms
of brain maturation and the potential to harness and revive adult plasticity for rehabilitation.
Second, we will investigate how visual experience affects individual differences in brain development, testing if
blindness results in more variable brain organization. Assessing brain-wide connections of the blind VC and its atypical
responses to non-visual tasks, we will test if VC plasticity affords more variable outcomes which can explain
contradictory group-level findings about VC role in blindness. We will examine the pattern of VC compensatory
engagement in blindness, testing whether plasticity in blindness can change typical VC sensory functions for higher-
level cognitive roles or if it is restricted by neuroanatomical limitations, clarifying the capacity for plasticity in the human
brain.
Finally, we will determine if VC has a single consistent role in all blind individuals or if distinct individual patterns
emerge, patterns that could be employed for individualized rehabilitation. We will examine whether unique and
longitudinally-stable whole-brain patterns of plasticity relate to compensatory behavioral abilities in blind individuals for
touch82-84, hearing63,85-87, memory88-92 and language93,94 and to VC non-visual recruitment. We will further use such
individual plasticity patterns to predict which blind individuals may benefit from a sensory aid (sensory substitution),
revealing if different subtypes of plasticity can indicate behavioral capacities across individuals and be employed as
rehabilitation biomarkers.
Overall, this project will improve our understanding of brain plasticity principles in blindness, and open a path to
defining biomarkers for personalized treatments for visual impairment."
10775739,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Georgetown and South Park communities of the Duwamish Valley (DV) face higher levels of
environmental pollution and poorer health outcomes compared to the rest of Seattle. For many years the
communities have organized to address these environmental and health disparities, prioritizing air pollution
and asthma. Our proposal is (1) directly responsive to community requests, (2) strengthens previous
community-academic-government partnerships in the DV, (3) advances the environmental health interests of
the community, (4) investigates low-cost tools for the measurement and control of air pollution, and (5)
evaluates individual and community empowerment throughout all phases of research and action. This
multilevel community engaged research (CEnR) project proposes elements that will engage and empower
members of the DV community. The household-level intervention - providing participants with indoor air filters -
has the goal of improving indoor air quality and reducing asthma symptoms in children. In contrast with
previous studies investigating high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, our intervention will evaluate the
effectiveness of low-cost box fans equipped with lower-efficiency filters with greater airflow. The low-cost filters
will be coupled with established home-based multicomponent, multi-trigger indoor air quality assessment of
homes. We will conduct a randomized control trial to rigorously evaluate differences between intervention and
control households in asthma outcomes such as symptoms and forced expiratory volume and in
concentrations of indoor particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC). Promotores and healthy home
consultants recruited from the community will be instrumental in carrying out the intervention. At the community
level, we will expand community-driven ambient air monitoring campaigns, prioritizing the characterization of
traffic-related air pollution, identification of pollutant sources, and emissions reductions. The use of a low-cost
monitoring network will improve the spatial resolution of air quality data in the DV, enabling us to identify PM,
BC and nitrogen dioxide hotspots. Youth from the well-established Duwamish Valley Youth Corp program will
be trained in various aspects of air monitoring to help carry out the campaign. Armed with data on air quality,
community members (who will also be trained in policy advocacy) can advocate for structural change including
policy, infrastructure improvements such as urban green space, and targeted regulation of industrial and/or
transportation emissions. Throughout the project, independent evaluation of individual and community
engagement and empowerment will be tracked. From defining scientific goals, to project implementation and
evaluation, our CEnR approach is designed to engage and empower a resilient community in its goal to
advance health equity."
10770448,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: NEUROBEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHIATRY CORE
 The NeuroBehavioral and Psychiatry (NBP) Core, previously the Neurobehavioral Unit of the
NeuroAssessment Core from the prior funding period, is a new Core proposed for the competing HNRC renewal.
The new NBP Core will apply assessment expertise in conducting comprehensive neuropsychological,
psychiatric (including both psychiatric diagnoses and dimensional symptom levels), substance use, and daily
functioning assessments. This supports the Center’s new emphasis on neurobehavioral phenotypes among
persons with HIV (PWH), and links them to medical and biological data from other HNRC Cores and associated
studies. NBP aims map directly onto the Office of AIDS Research Priorities under the major topic of “HIV-
associated comorbidities, coinfections, and complications” by addressing areas of neurologic consequences,
mental illness, and health disparities. The goals of the NBP Core are to contribute to the identification of
individuals who have evidenced changes in cognition, depression and daily functioning, and to provide
comprehensive longitudinal neurocognitive, psychiatric, substance use and everyday functioning assessments
on the PWH and HIV- comparison participants. Importantly, our core will provide the neuropsychological and
psychiatric (including depression) assessments in order to determine neurobehavioral phenotypes. We aim to
facilitate and enhance multidisciplinary research in neuroHIV by providing a range of services, training and
scientific consultation to projects such as investigator-driven R01s, R21s, and R34s, international neuroHIV
studies, and a variety of intra- and extramural investigations. Historically, the NBP Core and its investigators
have been national and international leaders in the neuroHIV field, spurring the development of both international
harmonization of assessments and new methods, while adapting to the continually evolving scientific landscape.
We aim to continue in this regard. In addition, in support of the HNRC’s increased focus on combined
neurobehavioral phenotypes among PWH, and participants who change over time, the NBP Core will administer
a more detailed psychiatric assessment which will examine detailed components of depression (e.g., anhedonia,
apathy), anxiety, stress, adverse childhood events and life trauma, and resilience and social support. All of these
factors may influence the complex relationships among neurocognition, depression, HIV disease and other
clinical outcomes. We will work hand-in-hand with 1) the NeuroMedical Core to identify underlying biological
mechanisms of neurobehavioral phenotypes, exploring connections to HIV disease (e.g., CSF viral load),
inflammatory processes/biomarkers (e.g., IL-6), other medical comorbidities (e.g., metabolic syndrome), co-
infections (e.g., CMV; NM and NVB Cores); and 2) with the MIBI Core to explore effects of microbiome and
metabolome on neurobehavioral outcomes and/or phenotypes; and with both NM and NVB Cores regarding
neuroinflammation and long-term protective and/or neurotoxic effects of antiretrovirals."
10770452,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: NeuroMedical Core
 The newly reorganized, NeuroMedical (NM) Core will have the overall goal of supporting comprehensive
neuromedical, laboratory, and neuroimaging assessments for the characterization of people with HIV (PWH) and
HIV uninfected (HIV-) controls. The Core will be composed of three integrated components: the Clinical
Assessment (CA) and Laboratory (Lab) Units along with a Neuroimaging (NI) “Portal”, which will provide access
to extensive UCSD imaging resources. In close collaboration with the other scientific Cores, the NM Core will
aim to: 1) Evaluate the impact on mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, neurobehavioral phenotypes) of
HIV infection and comorbid conditions (e.g. insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome), coinfections (e.g. CMV,
latent toxoplasmosis), antiretroviral therapy (ART) neuroprotection or neurotoxicity, and inflammation (e.g.,
cytokines, T-cell activation); 2) Evaluate the reciprocal effects over time, of mental health factors (e.g. apathy,
stress, resilience, self-efficacy) and cognition, and downstream effects of these neurobehavioral factors on
neuromedical and HIV disease outcomes (e.g. virologic suppression, healthcare engagement); 3) Support
studies of the central nervous system (CNS) impact of interventions designed to alter HIV reservoirs and achieve
functional cure, and treatment of latent or clinically asymptomatic coinfections; and 4) Evaluate how the
microbiome influences inflammation, microbial production of neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin) and in turn,
neurobehavioral phenotypes including depression and cognition, as well as circadian rhythms, sleep, and social
functioning. We aim to facilitate and enhance multidisciplinary research in neuroHIV by providing resources
including a range of services, training and scientific consultation to HNRC-associated projects (e.g., R01s, R21s),
international neuroHIV studies, and a variety of extramural investigations. Historically, the Core and its
investigators have been leaders in the field, spurring the development of new methods and adapting to the
continually evolving scientific landscape. Consistent with this, the Core will provide resources to support the
Center's expanded focus on depression and complex neurobehavioral phenotypes. Standard evaluations will
continue to include a structured neuromedical history, clinical and laboratory examinations, and establishment
of diagnoses of central and peripheral neurological complications. Additional unique services of the Core include
stool collection for gut microbiome characterization and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection.
The Lab Unit will perform blood and CSF biomarker assays and provide expertise in their analysis and
interpretation. The NI Portal will provide resources (e.g., training, consultation, technical support) in support of
studies investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of mental health disorders in the context of HIV using a
broad array of techniques (e.g., structural, functional, and metabolite MRI, PET imaging)."
10770456,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: NeuroVirology and Biology (NVB)
The NeuroVirology and Biology (NVB) core will focus on four major themes underlying NeuroHIV, in line with the
HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) priorities and the OAR scientific agenda: 1) the impact of viral
epigenetics on HIV persistence in the central nervous system (CNS), 2) latent or clinically asymptomatic co-
infections, 3) mitochondrial biogenesis, 4) brain macrophage and astroglial response to systemic mediators of
inflammation and current antiretroviral therapy (ART). The NVB core will continue to enhance the HNRC’s
transdisciplinary focus through close collaborations with the NeuroBehavioral and Psychiatry, NeuroMedical,
Microbiome and Developmental Cores, and utilizing laboratory and analytic techniques specific to CNS-derived
viral and cellular populations in the setting of neurocognitive and other neurobehavioral consequences.
The NVB Core is structured in two complementary units: NeuroVirology Unit and NeuroBiology Unit. These units
will be an integral and indispensable part of the HNRC, and will provide invaluable knowledge and technologies
to enhance research productivity and scientific input to meet the Center’s overall goals and objectives.
· The NeuroVirology Unit will provide expertise and a broad range of validated and clinically relevant
 laboratory-based assays with the highest quality and most convenience possible. This Unit has a research
 focus on HIV persistence within the CNS and will continue to offer assays to characterize the HIV reservoir
 in the brain and in myeloid cells, with a new focus on proviral epigenetics. It will offer cutting-edge sequencing
 methods to characterize the epigenetic landscape of the HIV provirus from clinical samples. This Unit will
 characterize viral (genotypic and phenotypic), and other factors (co-infections, inflammation, mitochondrial
 damage) associated with neurocognitive and other neurobehavioral consequences, such as depression.
· The NeuroBiology Unit will perform state-of-the-art neurobiology and neuropathology analyses of human
 brain tissues and in vitro experimental systems, that allow NeuroHIV investigators to understand the cellular
 mechanisms associated with mood and neurocognitive disorders. It will analyze the potential neurotoxic
 effects of current ART regimens on specific neuroglial cell populations. The NeuroBiology Unit will investigate
 the effect of ART and HIV on mitochondrial biogenesis in brains, and in vitro in cultures exposed to ART. In
 support of the Center’s expanded focus on depression and depression related factors, this unit will study the
 impact of anti-depressant medication on neuronal homeostasis, focusing on markers of autophagy and
 associated gatekeepers, e.g. brain immunophilins. The NeuroBiology Unit will incorporate the biomarker
 findings from the NeuroMedical Core in the research plans using banked specimens from the CNTN/NNTC.
Finally, the NVB core will continue to provide quality service, implement improved strategic planning processes,
expand its program income system, maintain flexibility to determine offered services, and expand the extensive
number of services already available to HIV investigators."
10763855,"The goals of the user training and outreach component are to provide training to prepare biomedical
researchers to perform experiments using the BioCAT resource and to engage in outreach activities to inform
the scientific community about BioCAT capabilities and to recruit new user research projects. Each year, more
than 70 new users come to the BioCAT Resource. We have developed a training program for all users
regardless of the level of expertise of the users or the properties of their samples. Before coming to the
beamline, even before submitting a proposal, users are encouraged to view our online user manuals and video
tutorials available on the BioCAT webpage https://www.bio.aps.anl.gov, which provide the information users
need to plan efficient and meaningful experiments. On-site users receive one-on-one, in-person training
covering (1) operation of the beamline, (2) data collection strategies and techniques, (3) data reduction and (4)
data interpretation. Training is also provided on all aspects of the data-to-interpretation process before and
beyond allocated beam time. The BioCAT user community is characterized by a broad range of expertise. At
one extreme are a few advanced users who require training only if changes have occurred since their previous
visit, and at the other extreme are the majority of users, who initially have little or no experience with SAXS or
Fiber Diffraction. Training follows a graded approach that bring novices up to speed quickly and that allows
them to grow into more advanced practitioners as their skills mature. Training is also provided to the greater
research community. BioCAT staff will engage in workshops, to provide training on all aspects of SAXS and
Fiber Diffraction to new and existing communities. We will collect metrics that can tell us how effective our
training programs have been and gather information that can indicate how they may be improved and how they
can reach under-represented groups. Vigorous outreach activity by BioCAT staff has resulted in significant
growth of the user community, sustaining a high level of beamline productivity. The recently revamped BioCAT
web site contains complete information concerning BioCAT capabilities and includes material targeted to past,
and prospective users. We will continue to develop new web content tailored to Inform the broader research
community about the capabilities of BioCAT and how to obtain beam time. BioCAT will continue to distribute
BioCAT-maintained data analysis tools to a broad user community. We will collect metrics that can tell us how
effective our outreach programs have been and gather information that can indicate how they may be
improved."
10763857,"The objective of the Fiber Diffraction Technology Operations Core at BioCAT is to provide the biomedical
community access to optimized facilities for fiber diffraction of muscle and fibrous protein systems that are
unique in the USA and competitive with all other facilities worldwide. The muscle diffraction program at BioCAT
is renowned for its history of addressing important questions regarding the biophysics of muscle contraction
and its regulation. More recently, emphasis has shifted to more directly biomedically relevant problems with
muscle from transgenic animal models for human disease, including inherited cardiomyopathies. BioCAT is
also known for the seminal fiber crystallography studies on the structure of collagenous and amyloid systems.
In recent years, there has been a shift from studying individual fibrous protein samples towards spatially-
resolved scanning diffraction imaging studies that examine the relationships between molecular structure and
tissue organization in complex biological tissues such as brain and connective tissue in order to address
maladies such as traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer metastasis. Our staff are
internationally recognized experts in fiber diffraction able to provide expertise in all aspects of a project from
experimental design, execution of the experiments, through to data analysis and interpretation. Staff work
closely throughout the experiments with first time users and in the context of formal collaborations involving
complicated experiments. For routine experiments by experienced users, staff provide onsite training, 24/7 on-
call support and are available for help both before and after scheduled experiments. We present plans to adapt
the BioCAT beamline 18ID to exploit the outstanding opportunities presented by the APS upgrade (APS-U).
This includes plans to upgrade the main area detector to a state-of-the-art EIGER2 XE 9M pixel array detector
with necessary upgrades to networking and computational infrastructure. The 20 years old beamline will be
upgraded with modern control systems and diagnostics with continuing routine maintenance and contingency
plans to ensure reliable operations. An ultra-high flux wide bandpass X-ray monochromator will be installed in
order to maintain our competitive edge with other facilities nationally and worldwide to the benefit of all
experimental modalities. User experience, quality and integrity of data will be enhanced by continuing
improvements to the BioCAT developed experimental control hardware/software system, BioCon. The
MuscleX data reduction and analysis package, also developed at BioCAT, for muscle diffraction, fiber
crystallography, and scanning diffraction imaging will be enhanced and integrated into data analysis pipelines
to provide real time feedback to users during experiments as well as greatly accelerate time to publication.
BioCAT will provide training and access to multi-scale simulations for interpreting dynamic muscle diffraction
data. Procedures and infrastructure will be developed and deployed for robust data and meta-data curation
and archiving."
10808893,"SUMMARY
Transposable elements (TEs, also referred to as jumping genes or mobile elements) are extraordinary
contributors to eukaryotic genome diversity, including in humans. TEs make up more than 50% of the human
genome and are far more common than protein coding genes, which comprise about 1% of the human
genome. Despite their abundance, TEs are understudied and major aspects of their mobile element biology
remain elusive. Due to their random insertion within the genome, insertions occur both in intergenic and genic
regions (including in exons). As retrotransposition is ongoing, with ~1 new insertion per 20 live births, there are
millions of polymorphic TEs within the human population, including some associated with disease. Highly repe-
titive regions are notoriously difficult to assemble, overrepresented at contig ends, and under-annotated from
short-read sequencing reads (presently prevalent in biomedical settings). In Aim I, we will improve the
annotation of the human mobilome (the genome’s entire mobile element content) by building upon the human
reference genome and the Human Genome Structural Variation consortium (providing access to Illumina short-
read and PacBio HiFi sequencing data). Part of our focus will be on improved calling of TEs from short-read
sequencing data. We will (a) implement chimpanzee as an outgroup in order to distinguish between TE
insertions and deletions containing TE sequence; and (b) develop a targeted-sequencing approach for trans-
posable elements. The latter will be combined with whole genome sequencing. Our targeted sequencing
approach will provide deeper coverage of breakpoints, improving identification of mobile elements. We will also
generate a high-resolution subfamily annotation with well-resolved end-branches. The youngest subfamilies
are commonly collapsed within older subfamilies because of size and few shared diagnostic mutations.
Underidentifying the youngest subfamilies leads to an apparent relative quiescence of TEs in recent history.
Building upon the TE annotation improvement in Aim I, we will investigate TEs to identify and characterize pu-
tative source elements (i.e. TEs capable of generating offspring insertions). Most TE insertions are dead upon
arrival and not able to create offspring TEs. While the identification of active L1s is relatively easy, the
identification of the drivers of Alu and SVA expansion has been far more elusive. A fine-scale TE subfamily
resolution that includes the youngest subfamilies will both shed light on the most recent TE evolution, and
allow investigation of source elements (which tend to be deleterious to their host) within the youngest
subfamilies. This makes the youngest subfamilies a prime target for an integrative source element identification
comparative approach."
10783076,"This application is in response to the NIAID RFA-AI-21-075 entitled “Identification and Characterization of
Persistence Mechanisms of Select Protozoan Pathogens”, which explicitly states the study of P. vivax
hypnozoites as a research objective. P. vivax malaria burdens people within a wide global range and is more
pathogenic than previously appreciated. The parasite’s epidemiology and clinical impact is governed by latent
liver stages called hypnozoites, which are the source of relapsing blood stage infection. The molecular regulation
of hypnozoite stage formation, persistence and activation in hepatocytes has until recently remained unstudied,
mainly due to the lack of laboratory tools for this parasite. This has changed of the past ten years with the
development of our robust human liver-chimeric mouse model (FRG huHep mouse) that enables the detailed
analysis of hypnozoite formation and persistence as well the occurrence of relapses and robust in vitro primary
hepatocyte models of infection. In addition, with partners we have recently developed the genetically defined P.
vivax Chesson strain for use in hypnozoite studies, replacing complex field-isolate derived sporozoites for
infection. With these tools, the goals of this application are the identification of the parasite molecular drivers of
hypnozoite formation and persistence and host hepatocyte factors that impact hypnozoite formation and
persistence. We will achieve these goals through three independent but complementary aims. In Aim 1 we will
generate and interrogate hypnozoite gene expression data with emphasis on factors that are known to regulate
quasi-persistence in salivary gland sporozoites. Candidate factors such as AP2 transcription factors, the
eIF2a/IK2/UIS2 translational repression system and the, SAP1 and PUF stress granule mRNA storage system
will undergo comprehensive examination in P. vivax hypnozoites. Implicated factors that might drive and maintain
hypnozoite persistence will then be functionally interrogated using transgene expression and knockout as well
as overexpression in a rodent malaria model. In aim 2, we will establish a P. vivax transgenesis system using
sporozoite transfection and the Saimiri monkey infection model to establish P. vivax reporter gene-expressing
parasite lines, including a line that expresses a hypnozoite-specific marker GRP94, recently identified by us. We
will also functionally analyze factors in P. vivax that show strong persistence phenotypes in aim 1 to directly
interrogate their role in hypnozoite formation and persistence. In aim 3, we will identify and interrogate host
factors with emphasis on host defenses and metabolism in hypnozoite-infected hepatocytes. Host factors that
are associated with hypnozoite formation and persistence will be functionally analyzed using siRNA-mediated
knockdown and overexpression techniques in an in vitro hypnozoite infection model. Together, this application
will gain unprecedented insights into the parasite-intrinsic molecular regulation of liver stage latency as well as
the host factors that can further shape the latency phenotype. The findings might lead to the identification of new
parasite-targeted and host-targeted therapeutics that prevent relapsing malaria infection."
10758607,"Abstract
Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have an increased risk of developing
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Human gut microbiome composition has recently been associated
with a wide array of diseases, including IBD and colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that gut microbiota
could influence colon epithelium to initiate or promote colorectal cancer development directly or indirectly.
However, little is known on the structure and function of the microbiota in CAC and how they implicate the
development of CAC at the molecular level. In this study, we will investigate the role of microbiota in the
development of CAC, as well as the molecular events underlying the interplay of microbiota and host response.
The project builds upon our previous studies in examining the genomic instabilities and proteome alterations in
the colon epithelium during the pathogenesis of IBD-CAC, and will focus on the mechanistic and functional
involvement of the microbiome and their components in the modulation (by protective bacteria) or activation
(by tumorigenic bacteria) of CAC development. Specifically, we will investigate the implication of mucosa-
associated microbiota in CAC by an integrated approach using three model systems, including clinical
specimens (Aim 1), in vitro microbial cultivation and organoid models (Aim 2), and in vivo mouse model (Aim
3). Our integrative, state-of-the-art approach will characterize the composition, functional genes and pathways
of the microbiome implicated in CAC, and the impact of microbiota on colon mucosa. By studying the gut
microbiota and its interplay with the colon host using novel approaches and cutting-edge technology, our study
has significant translational potential that could lead to establishing the gut microbiome as predictors of CAC
risk and aid in developing approaches for CAC prevention and detection in IBD patients."
10814993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ultimate goal of this research program is to determine the neural mechanisms of sequence monitoring across
species. This knowledge can contribute to understanding new treatments for disorders where sequential
behaviors are disrupted, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Daily, we monitor sequences of visual
information such as the series of bus or train stops when looking for the correct exit. Sequence monitoring is the
active process of tracking the order of subsequent “states” or steps. Monitoring is distinct from other well-studied
sequence processes, such as explicit memorization, or potentially more automatic behaviors such as a series of
motor outputs (e.g., playing the piano) or statistical sequence learning. However, the monitoring aspects of
sequence processing remain largely unknown.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the neural mechanisms of nonmotor and nonspatial sequence
monitoring across species. Reflecting its importance, a large network of cortical and subcortical areas is
implicated in sequence processing, including frontal cortices, premotor cortex, medial temporal lobe, basal
ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebellum. When focusing on high-level monitoring of nonmotor and nonspatial
sequences by human and nonhuman primates, our Preliminary Data and other evidence indicates that lateral
and medial prefrontal cortices (LPFC and MPFC, respectively), play a unique role. However, the specific
contributions of each have not been determined. Two key features of sequences (e.g., ABCD) that may be
encoded in neural activity are their ordinality or item-in-position associations (C in position 3) and temporal
context or item-item associations (B is after A). Behavioral studies indicate that both kinds of information are
used to monitor sequences. Previous studies, including our own, have found ordinality encoding in LPFC and
MPFC. However, prior work has not established whether temporal encoding may additionally exist in these
regions and any coding differences between these areas. We hypothesize MPFC primarily codes ordinality, and
LPFC uses signals from MPFC to code ordinality and temporal context.
We will directly test these hypotheses by triangulating behavioral, whole brain, and cellular data in studies across
species. We will apply the unique capabilities of our lab to study cognitive capabilities across brain areas in
behaving monkeys using fMRI (Aim 1), the functional homology and correspondence to more abstract sequential
tasks in humans using fMRI (Aim 2), and use these signals to guide electrophysiology in monkeys (Aim 3).
Parallel fMRI studies across species will allow us to leverage each for distinct strengths in hypothesis testing:
detailed neurophysiology in monkeys, and detailed cognitive studies in humans."
10818398,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adipose tissue phenotype and physiology are thought to be important contributors to overall metabolic health,
and our preliminary data suggests that exercise training improves adipose tissue biology. The objectives of the
proposed project are to elucidate how alterations in adipose tissue cellular composition and endocrine signaling
may contribute to the beneficial adaptations to exercise and to generate new mechanistic insights into the role
of adipose tissue in metabolic health.
Aim 1 will study the effects of exercise training on adipose tissue macrophage populations and inflammatory
profile and will examine the association of these changes with metabolic health. Older adults with prediabetes
and obesity will participate in a 3-month exercise training intervention with metabolic health, adipose tissue
macrophage populations, and adipose inflammatory molecular signatures measured before and after the training
intervention. Aim 2 will determine how acute exercise triggers key signaling events (e.g., immune cell infiltration,
release of adipokines, extracellular vesicles) in adipose tissue that are likely to have paracrine and endocrine
effects. Leukocyte populations and inflammatory signatures will be assessed in adipose tissue biopsies collected
from older adults before, immediately after, and 3 hours after a 30-minute bout of cycling exercise. The adipose
tissue secretome will be assessed in plasma and in media collected from cultured human adipose tissue
explants. Overall, this project will elucidate the effects of exercise on adipose tissue phenotype and provide
mechanistic insight into the causes of metabolic dysfunction.
The career development plan that accompanies the proposed project will facilitate my successful transition to
independent research scientist. My career development plan will provide the foundation on which I can build an
independent research program, comprising the following elements: didactic training in multidisciplinary fields;
mentorship by experts in bioinformatics, clinical and translational research, diabetes, aging, and exercise; and
hands-on experience in clinical research, bioinformatics, and scientific communication With the proposed career
development plan, I will learn new statistical and bioinformatics approaches and laboratory techniques; gain
basic knowledge in tangential fields of science to enable me to ask integrative questions and to seek out
multidisciplinary collaborators; and lead an independent clinical trial, gaining vital experience in clinical research
with guidance from experience mentors. The supportive environment fostered by my mentorship team and by
Mayo Clinic will allow me to establish multidisciplinary collaborations and to become an independent investigator."
10896121,"Tissue damage responses are essential for multicellular organisms that occasionally encounter a hostile
environment. These multi-tissue responses include epithelial barrier repair (wound healing), inflammation, and
sensory responses like nociceptive sensitization. Together, these coordinated responses restore tissue
functionality and/or protect the tissue from further damage while it heals. Our overarching hypothesis is that the
biology of tissue repair arose early in the evolution of multicellular organisms. Consequently, many of the
cellular strategies, signaling pathways, and behaviors that animals use to sense and to repair damage are
ancient and evolutionarily conserved. Discovery of the basic cell biology and genetic underpinnings of these
damage-induced responses is essential. Our long term goal is to identify the full suite of cells and genes that
initiate and execute each tissue damage response and understand how these cells and genes function and
work together to orchestrate successful repair of damaged tissues. My laboratory has pioneered the use of
Drosophila larvae to study postembryonic tissue damage responses including wound closure, inflammation,
and injury-induced nociceptive (pain) sensitization. During our first four years of MIRA funding we discovered
important principles of wound edge adhesion dynamics, found a signaling pathway (related to vertebrate
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor [VEGF] signaling) required for spreading of inflammatory blood cells at
wound sites, and explored injury-induced sensitization to cold, chemical, and mechanical stimuli. Our work
over the next five years will focus on three key questions that emerge naturally from these prior studies: 1. How
are adherens junction proteins (like β-Catenin) removed from the wound edge and how does this removal
impact other wound-edge responses like actin polymerization? This question emerges from our observation
that β-Catenin is rapidly removed from wound-edge membranes. With new tools we developed in the prior
grant period we are in an excellent position to image this process in real-time at highly symmetric wounds and
to discover which signaling pathways coordinate removal. 2. One key question with respect to inflammation is
how inflammatory blood cells initially adhere to the wound. In our second project we will explore this key
question and investigate the relationship between immune cell adhesion/spreading and immune cell function at
the wound site. Our final project will seek to identify key functional downstream genes that mediate acute
injury-induced nociceptive sensitization. This is a major gap in our understanding of this process and a key
question in the study of nociceptive sensitization. My lab’s substantial history of creative high-impact research
on diverse tissue damage responses suggests strongly that we will continue to make original strides and
discoveries, especially if our ongoing grant-writing burden is lessened through the MIRA mechanism. Our
system complements others in the field and the likelihood of continued novel basic insight into how organisms
cope with tissue damage at the cellular and molecular/genetic levels is high."

etiologies, including damaging variants in genes with diverse functions in cardiac biology. During the prior
funding period we showed that the most common genetic cause of DCM was truncating variants in titin
(TTNtv). These account for 25% of familial and 12% of sporadic DCM and for ~10% of DCM that occurs with
pregnancy, alcohol abuse, and after cancer therapies. In addition, ~0.2% of the general population carries a
TTNtv; these individuals have substantially higher lifelong risks for developing DCM and heart failure. We also
identified mechanisms by which TTNtv and other recently recognized DCM genes (FLNC and ALPK3) cause
disease. With this competitive renewal we propose to focus on the discovery of genes and mechanisms that
account for unexplained DCM, which remains an unmet need.
 We propose that some unexplained DCM is mechanistically related to established genetic causes and
results from sequence variants that are not routinely interrogated, or that have unclear functional
consequences. We will study the roles of somatic variants, non-coding regulatory variants, mitochondrial
variants, and variants of unknown significance (VUS) in established and newly identified DCM genes. We will
also define cell populations and transcriptional profiles of all cells in human hearts with unexplained DCM and
DCM with established genetic etiologies, so as to identify shared or distinct pathways that may inform
therapeutic opportunities.
 Our analyses will employ state-of-the art technologies. We will exploit whole genome sequencing
(WGS) from blood- and cardiac tissue-derived DNAs obtained from unexplained DCM subjects. We will use
single nuclear RNA sequencing (NucSeq) to define how cell populations and transcription change in DCM
hearts in comparison to normal hearts, using our recently completed normal human heart NucSeq data. We
will perturb new identified variants and mechanisms in iPSC-CMs and mouse models.
 These studies will improve knowledge of the molecules and pathways that enable normal heart
function, the molecular causes and mechanisms of DCM, information that will improve diagnosis and inform
precision therapies to prevent heart failure. Our analyses will also contribute functional insights into noncoding
sequences. To accomplish these goals, we will: 1) Identify coding and non-coding, germline and somatic
variants that contribute to unexplained DCM; 2) Define perturbed cell populations and associated
transcriptional profiles in hearts from variant-positive and unexplained DCM; 3) Define DCM
mechanisms using engineered iPSC-CMs and mouse models."

Drosophila melanogaster is one of the leading animal models for biomedical research, with researchers
generating new lines of Drosophila every year for studies in numerous cancers, genetic disorders, and other
maladies. Currently there are greater than 160,000 Drosophila stocks held at different stock centers around the
world. As reliable and cost-effective approaches for long-term preservation of Drosophila stocks are lacking,
individual labs and stock centers must maintain their lines as living populations, which is resource-intensive and
puts the stocks at risk of loss. In 2021, our group developed an easily implemented and robust cryopreservation
protocol for Drosophila melanogaster embryos which can be applied in any lab without the need for specialized
instruments. This protocol is broadly applicable, and it has been successfully used to preserve 25 distinct strains
from different sources. For most strains, >50% of the embryos hatch and >25% of the resulting larvae develop
into fully functioning adults after cryopreservation and rewarming (normalized survival to control embryos),
providing sufficient numbers of adults to revive the strain. To accelerate the cryopreservation and archival of
critical Drosophila stocks, we will develop, standardize, and disseminate resources to individual labs and stock
centers. Significant efforts will be devoted to developing reliable methods for cryogenic storage and shipping of
Drosophila embryos as well as to study if any significant mutagenic changes occur due to cryopreservation. We
will be working with multiple groups within the cryobiology and fly community to gather feedback on and refine
our approach. With the collaboration of the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC), we will identify and
prioritize the stocks that need cryopreservation to prevent their total loss in the event of a disaster or genetic
drift. We will also demonstrate the efficacy of our cryopreservation protocol on a large scale with a selected
group of stocks identified by BDSC. Finally, we will also estimate the costs for cryopreservation in comparison
to the traditional method of Drosophila maintenance to inform future efforts to protect these precious genetic
resources. This is a multi-PI project led by investigators with significant experience in Drosophila genetics and
cryobiology."

Spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, spina bifida, and stroke, as well as complications
due to aging and diabetes, can produce a loss of voluntary control over bowel and bladder function resulting
in both fecal and urinary incontinence as well as retention in the same patient. The activities proposed in this
application will enable Dignify Therapeutics to complete preclinical development of an on-demand, rapid-
onset (< 5 min), short-duration (< 10 min), drug-induced, voiding therapy to restore voluntary control of bowel
and bladder function for the patient populations listed above. This project will culminate in the filing of an
Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for DTI-117 and completion of a Phase I clinical study.
Neurokinin 2 receptors (NK2Rs) are located at several sites in the defecation and micturition pathways,
particularly the colorectal and urinary bladder smooth muscles. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies in
several species, including human tissue, have shown that activation of NK2Rs produces forceful colonic and
bladder contractions. Our previous preclinical studies showed that when administered via intramuscular,
intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, or sublingual routes, NK2R agonists, including DTI-117, rapidly
induced transient increases in colorectal and bladder pressures that produced urination and defecation.
DTI-117 is currently in preclinical development by Dignify Therapeutics. Under NINDS CREATE Bio
Optimization Track award U44NS106685, efficacy, selectivity, and preliminary safety of DTI-117 has been
established. A GMP-compliant synthetic route, physicochemical characterization, analytical methods,
bioanalytical assays, in vitro characterization, and target selectivity for NK2Rs versus multiple common
drug targets have all been established. Preclinical efficacy, measured as rapid-onset defecation and
urination, has been demonstrated, and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles mimic in vivo pharmacodynamic
profiles. General toxicity studies completed to-date indicate that DTI-117 is both safe and effective.
The final step for preclinical development of DTI-117 is to file an Investigational New Drug application (IND)
prior to initiation of clinical studies. FDA guidelines require that acceptable toxicological and safety profiles
are demonstrated in preclinical studies conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions for
inclusion in the IND. In parallel, drug substance and drug product must be manufactured according to strict
FDA regulations. Completion of these activities as described in this application will enable an IND filing for
DTI-117."
10764701,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overwhelming bacterial pneumonia injures and stiffens the lung leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) that carries a mortality of up to 50%. Given many failed pharmacologic treatments, ARDS management
is supportive. ARDS is a consequence of endothelial and alveolar epithelial injury followed by recruitment and
accumulation of inflammatory cells in the injured alveolus. Macrophages are the key effector cells in the lung
injury process by phagocytizing invading pathogens and secreting cytokines. We have identified that the
mechanosensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), protects the lung from injury in
an in vivo model of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia through a novel mechanism of MAPK
molecular switching, from JNK to p38. However, the key intracellular signaling molecules that link TRPV4 to the
MAPK molecular switch and the precise cell phenotype/function that increases phagocytosis/bacterial clearance
and decreases lung injury are unknown. Uncovering novel mechanosensitive signaling mechanisms that control
macrophage function when the lung is injured/stiff will fulfill the unmet medical need to design therapies to treat
this devastating disease. This research proposal investigates the mechanism whereby TRPV4 adapts the host
defense to enhance the lung injury response to P. aeruginosa pneumonia. The long-term goal of our studies is
to deduce TRPV4-dependent intracellular signals in macrophages that protect and resolve pneumonia-
associated lung injury. Our preliminary data show that macrophage TRPV4 signals through specific intracellular
signaling molecules to alter the macrophage activation response in vitro. Therefore, we propose the novel
hypothesis: TRPV4 tailors the host response to protect the lung from injury after P. aeruginosa pneumonia
through macrophage intracellular signals. This hypothesis will be tested through three interrelated, but
independent specific aims: (1) to determine the mechanism whereby TRPV4 enhances macrophage
phagocytosis, (2) to determine the mechanism whereby TRPV4 limits pro-inflammatory cytokine
production, and (3) to compare the role of TRPV4 in alveolar vs interstitial macrophages in bacterial
clearance and infection-induced lung injury after P. aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. Our proposal is
innovative in concept as it is the first to implicate a matrix stiffness-sensing cation channel (TRPV4) and its
intracellular signaling molecules in bacterial pneumonia and associated lung tissue injury. The proposed
research is significant and relevant to the NIH’s mission as we aim to explore how TRPV4 in macrophages
integrates the infection and matrix mechanical signaling to protect the lung from injury. The pathways discovered
will identify novel therapeutic targets to treat infection-associated ARDS."

Hired migrant and seasonal farmworkers (FWs) experience unique employment conditions that challenge their
ability to live healthy, fulfilled lives. Hazardous work, unstable employment, atypical employment policies, lack
of government oversight and enforcement, extreme poverty, stringent immigration laws, and lack of social
support negatively impact the health and well-being of FWs. Further impediments include lengthy journeys
across dangerous borders, inconsistent immigration policies, transience, non-citizen status, residence in
remote rural settings, and limited access to healthcare and social services. Illinois is a major agricultural state
that hires upward of 50,000 FWs each year to support the US food supply chain. The overall goal of the Great
Lakes Center for Farmworker Health and Well-being (GLCFHW) is to implement strategies and actions leading
to systems change that protects and promotes the health and well-being of farmworkers across the US.
Specific aims are to: 1) conduct high quality research that elucidates pathways for change that benefits FWs;
2) build and strengthen multidirectional collaboration and engagement across eco-social levels to create
networks that support FW health and well-being; 3) translate and disseminate evidence to promote policies
and practices that demonstrate the value and approaches to supporting FW health and well-being within and
outside of work. We have assembled Center Administration, cores in Evaluation and Planning, Outreach, and
Research, and Internal and External Advisory groups and we have garnered the support of stakeholders. We
will conduct three research projects: 1) to translate and test survey tools; 2) to link state-based data systems

The Molecular Cytogenetics Core provides valuable scientific and technical support to MSK investigators
exploring the role of chromosomal instability in cancer. This is accomplished through appropriate and efficient
experiment design, custom multi-color DNA-FISH probe design and development, data analysis and
interpretation, and support with manuscript/grant preparation.
Currently, the Core provides 2 main categories of specialized service that operate at the single-cell level on a
variety of human and animal model research samples: conventional karyotyping and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). Conventional karyotyping is routinely performed to confirm cell line identity, screen
targeted mouse ESC clones intended for blastocyst injection, monitor the stability of cultured stem cells over
time, and measure chromosomal instability/heterogeneity as an experimental endpoint. Over the years, the
Core has assembled a broad range of molecular cytogenetics resources (plasmids, BAC clones, individual
whole chromosome painting probes), allowing the Core to provide FISH services at significantly lower cost.
FISH-based assays are routinely employed to map genes or transgene integration sites, detect
aneuploidy/chromosomal instability, co-detect DNA/protein and assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity; tests
include custom probe development, locus-specific FISH, whole-chromosome painting (WCP), spectral
karyotyping (SKY), Q-FISH, and Immuno-FISH. The Core is equipped with 5 modern Fluorescence imaging
systems including 2 with a wide range of applications that can be fully or partially automated. The Core also
provides training in tissue culture, karyotyping, and FISH.
During the past grant period, the services and collaborative work provided by the Molecular Cytogenetics Core
have supported the research of 84 investigators from 8 research program."
10766237,"The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation has had an operating Flow Cytometry Core for more than
thirty years. It has provided multiple investigators in the areas of Immunology, Cell Cycle, Cardiovascular Biology
and Developmental Biology with access to the instrumentation required to analyze and isolate cells using flow
cytometry.
 The aim of the Flow Cytometry Core is to provide access to state-of-the-art flow cytometry to the Project
Leaders in this CMRO COBRE. This includes not only access to the physical instruments required, but also
advice on the possibilities and limitations of the technology and help designing and interpreting experiments that
use these approaches. The projects in this COBRE will take advantage of some of the most common uses of
this technology, such as phenotyping based upon the expression of one or more cell surface (or intracellular)
molecules using fluorescently-labeled antibodies, and purification of these populations by sorting. In addition,
they will use flow cytometry for the functional assessment of cells, including analysis of cell cycle, analysis of
calcium signaling, and assessment of mitochondrial volume and health.
 Some of the more metabolism-focused assays such as Rhod2 to detect mitochondrial Ca+2 accumulation,
determination of mitochondrial mass, and glucose uptake assays are not routinely done by our users, and their
implementation will therefore broaden the expertise of the facility. This will help achieve the overall COBRE goal
of expanding cellular metabolism research and expertise in Oklahoma. Use of flow cytometric approaches to
analyze cellular metabolism changes is a fast-changing and relatively novel area, and the Core facility will evolve
as necessary to provide our investigators with access to any new tools required to advance their research
programs."

This is an initial submission of a K08 application by Dr. Renea Sturm, an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Urology
at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
Candidate: Dr. Sturm’s primary training objectives in this proposal are to: 1. Fill existing knowledge gaps in
the interaction between materials science and modeling 2. Learn scientific methodologies in material fabrication
and evaluation 3. Develop study design and scientific communication skills 4. Develop management and
leadership skills for a career as an independent investigator. Dr. Sturm will accomplish these activities through
mentorship, focused coursework, and participation in select workshops/conferences. This will be supported by
her primary mentors Song Li, PhD, Chair of Bioengineering at UCLA and an expert in cellular-materials
interactions and co-mentor Nasim Annabi, PhD, an expert in modifiable elastic hydrogels. She will be further
supported by mentor Isla Garraway, MD, PhD, an independent urologic surgeon-scientist. Her external advisory
committee will include focused materials science and tissue engineering expertise through Ali Khademhosseini,
PhD with expert knowledge of tissue engineering for the lower urinary tract provided by Arun Sharma, PhD.
Research: Urethral defects requiring urethroplasty occur in children and adults secondary to congenital,
traumatic, infectious, and malignant conditions. Current tissue sources for urethral replacement are limited by
donor site morbidity and lack of optimal tissue characteristics to support lifelong voiding and penile erections. A
subsequent high risk of short- and long-term urethroplasty complications highlights the need for an improved
tissue alternative with a bioinspired design. The goal of this proposal is to establish an independent surgeon-
scientist with focused materials expertise and a track record of creating and evaluating a highly elastic,
biomimetic urethral scaffold with optimized biomechanical properties by layer to support cellularization
followed by extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The research plan addresses key design requirements: 1)
optimized mechanical properties, 2) reproducible synthesis methods, and 3) wound healing and vascularization.
Our overall hypothesis is that a novel scaffold with the proposed combination of a hydrogel and elastin-like
peptide designed to meet targeted mechanical and structural parameters will improve suturability, early urinary
tract function, and local tissue recapitulation as compared to preputial or unseeded scaffold urethroplasties.
In Aim 1, composite electrospun scaffolds will be engineered with mechanical and structural properties that
mimic native urethral tissue. In Aim 2, an in vitro evaluation will elucidate the role of the mechanical niche in
cellular behavior and ECM deposition. In Aim 3, an ex vivo evaluation of functional and anatomic findings
following application of seeded and unseeded grafts will occur versus standard of care preputial urethroplasty.
Put together, this research strategy will engineer finely tuned elastic biomimetic scaffolds with target mechanical
and structural parameters derived from urethral tissue analyses to maximize future clinical translatability."
10769826,"We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible
Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard
colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased
risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than
that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to
more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse
events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the
colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special
maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of
technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will
be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp
removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between
an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal
permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between
the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of
commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring.
Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the
tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the
traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the
hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves
endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to
improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the
human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and
clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in
endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal
technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering
developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing
history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will
demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population
(IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection."
10791813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is the time of life when drug use is initiated; for this reason, adolescence represents a sensitive
period for the development of substance use disorder. Adolescents are undergoing many physiological
changes at this time, including marked changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region
responsible for inhibiting motivational drive. However, changes in the brain are co-occurring with changes in
the periphery. The adolescent gut microbiome is also in flux and shifts in the predominant species of bacteria
during this time have been linked to systemic inflammation, anxiety-like behavior, and stress responses. There
is a growing appreciation for peripheral factors in psychiatric disturbance and our lab has shown that the gut
microbiome might contribute to substance use disorder. Our preliminary results indicate that adults with gut
microbiome depletion have altered cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). However, adolescent, but not
adult, mice demonstrated decreased morphine CPP after short-term gut microbiome knockdown, suggesting
that adolescents are more sensitive to disruption of the gut microbiome. While the gut microbiome
communicates with the brain in more than one way, one major route of communication is via microbiome-
derived metabolites. The short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are breakdown products of fiber; these metabolites
readily cross the blood brain barrier and act as histone deacetylase inhibitors. Given the ability of SCFAs to
alter histone post-translational modifications and likely gene expression, we performed transcriptomic profiling
of adolescent and adult mPFC after manipulation of the gut microbiome. Microbiome-depleted adolescent mice
treated with morphine had 3x the amount of differentially regulated genes compared to depleted adults given
morphine. Gene ontology analysis identified patterns of genes involved in chromatin modification including
enhanced activity of histone deacetylase inhibitors, decreased histone acetyltransferase activity, decreased
DNA binding, and decreased RNA transcription in adolescents with a reduced gut microbiome given morphine,
but not in similarly treated adults. Our previous studies have suggested that the reduction in SCFAs produced
by microbiome depletion might underlie modulation of drug reward; supplementation of SCFAs eliminated the
effect of microbiome knockdown on cocaine place preference. The current proposal will build upon our
preliminary results to investigate the role of the adolescent gut microbiome on fentanyl self-administration and
will seek mechanistic understanding of its influence by examining the contribution of gut microbiome-derived
metabolites in opioid reinforcement and chromatin modification in mPFC."
10789924,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human microbiome is the sum of microbes that live in or on the human body, and it contributes to both health
and disease. Our previous work has established that nitric oxide (NO) generated by gut microbiota acts as a
language of inter-species communication between the microbiome and its host by changing fundamental host
functions. Altered gut microbiota has also been implicated as an important risk factor in the etiology of
inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease (CD). While excess NO generated by overexpression of
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the host gut has been observed in CD, the role of the NO derived from gut
microbiota has not been investigated or considered. NO signals in large part by post-translationally modifying
proteins via S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of NO to the thiol side-chain of specific cysteine residues to
form S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), altering protein function. Here we will test the hypothesis that communication
between gut microbiota and mammalian host via host protein S-nitrosylation impacts health in normal mice and
in a mouse model of CD. To do this, we will first characterize the extent to which microbiota-derived NO mediates
host S-nitrosylation of gut proteins including known CD-associated proteins, and demonstrate that host gut
proteins are highly regulated by microbiotal-NO/SNO. Further, we will show that gut microbiota-derived NO is
not limited to affecting just adjacent gut tissue but may have far-reaching systemic effects within the host, by
identifying host organs beyond the gut where endogenous protein S-nitrosylation and consequently organ
functions are impacted by gut microbiota-derived NO, in both healthy and CD mice. This will establish an organ-
specific, gut microbial NO-dependent SNO-proteome atlas at baseline, to compare and identify alterations found
in the SNO-proteome in the CD mouse model. This will also allow identification of specific host proteins in CD
whose S-nitrosylation depends significantly on NO derived from gut microbiota, enabling investigation of the role
of specific alterations in patients with CD. Additionally, the microbial-NO dependent S-nitrosylation signature in
gut and beyond will be helpful towards the diagnosis and treatment of CD. Using our CD mouse model, we will
also test the use of a specific class of aminoquinoline-based inhibitors that selectively target bacterial-NOSbut
not mammalian-NOSsas a treatment option of CD. Furthermore, the establishment of this gut microbiota-NO-
dependent SNO-proteome atlas in different major organs (gut, liver, heart, lung, kidney, brain) will be very useful
in studying its perturbations across different mice models of human disease in the future. In addition, we will
identify the mechanism(s) by which NO is transported from the gut to distant organs. The proposed work will, for
the first time, determine: the effect of gut microbiota-derived NO on mammalian host physiology via S-
nitrosylation, the mechanism of transport of bioactive SNOs from the gut to other organs, and the role of gut
microbiota-derived NO/SNO in normal physiology and in disease conditions, particularly CD. Altogether, our
work promises new understanding of means of communication between microbes and host."
10757464,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The intestinal epithelium perpetually self-renews and differentiates into specialized progenies. This process
is often viewed as a hard-wired genetic program under the control of host-derived factors. The organizing
principal of my proposal is that specification, differentiation and functional specialization of these epithelial
lineages are modulated by members of the gut microbiota and their metabolic products. Our groups' studies of
healthy and undernourished Bangladeshi children revealed that Prevotella copri is a key species whose
abundance in the developing microbiota is positively associated with ponderal growth. My current work in the
Gordon lab has established a gnotobiotic mouse model of mother-to-infant transmission of defined collections
of human gut bacterial strains that represent different stages in the postnatal assembly of gut microbiota. I
performed single-nucleus RNA-seq to test the effects of including or excluding P copri from these defined
communities. A prominent epithelial response to the presence of P. copri is enhanced enterocytic fatty acid
oxidation. Pseudotime analysis of snRNA-seq datasets disclosed that expression of fatty acid oxidation genes
was spatially regulated by P. copri as enterocytes differentiate/migrate from crypts up villi and that nuclear
receptor PPAR appears to be a top candidate regulator of these genes. I hypothesize that i) exposure to the
P. copri-containing community broadly alters the epigenetic landscape as well as chromatin accessibility to
transcription factor binding as enterocytes execute their differentiation program up the villus, and (ii) PPAR
functions as a key transcription factor that mediates the effects of P. copri on fatty acid oxidation with additional
regulatory inputs from other transcription factors. I propose two aims to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, I will
characterize, at single-cell resolution, changes in the epigenetic landscape and the transcription factors that
comprise the signaling pathways that P. copri-containing community uses to regulate enterocyte
differentiation/function along the length of the intestine. In Aim 2, I will characterize how the P. copri-containing
defined bacterial community modulates PPAR signaling to control enterocytic fatty acid oxidation along the
crypt-to-villus axis, by using a combination of liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry, 2-dimensional
organoid culture system, and gnotobiotic mouse models. This research will provide (i) mechanistic insights on
how gut microbiota modulates host signaling to control epithelial lineage development, metabolic function, and
functional specialization, and (ii) novel metabolites that have therapeutic potential to benefit intestinal
physiology and function."
10876241,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Translational cancer research that improves patient health requires a multi-disciplinary approach that advances
innovative discoveries from (A) basic research to (B) preclinical validation (often utilizing biobanked tissue) to
(C) clinical implementation via entrepreneurship and commercialization. But surgeons rarely receive formal
training in biobanking and entrepreneurship, and few programs are designed to formally train surgeons in the
cancer biology and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recognizing these critical gaps in training surgeon-
scientists, the Department of Surgery and the Moores Cancer Center (NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer
Center) and the Department of Surgery at the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego) propose a new
program to support training for MD/DO surgeon-scientists who show objective evidence of a commitment to a
career in academic surgical oncology for a two-year training program. We will create the Surgical Oncologists
as Scientists (SOAS) Training Program centered on formal training in three topics: 1) the TME; 2) biobanking;
and 3) innovation/entrepreneurship. The rationale for TME training is that increasingly, the oncologic surgeon-
scientist needs to thoroughly understand details of how the TME plays significant roles in cancer initiation,
progression, metastasis, response to therapies, and serves as novel targets for anti-cancer drugs. The rationale
for training in biobanking is that academic surgeons are frequently asked to collaborate in research because
their unparalleled access to human specimens, which must be properly banked in a dedicated biorepository.
Finally, the rationale for innovation/entrepreneurship training involves the critical need to ensure that
research training of surgeon-scientists has real-world translational relevance—that is, we need to demonstrably
improve cancer care, not merely improve understanding. This rationale leverages the metropolitan San Diego
area as the third largest assembly of components necessary to successfully translate (i.e., commercialize)
innovations into Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved clinical realities. San Diego includes a plethora
of biotech startups (hundreds spun out of UC San Diego), Angel investors, private equity and venture capital
firms, contract research organizations, and local networking activities. The SOAS program will be co-led by a
surgical oncologist/translational scientist and a PhD scientist that bring complementary, but unique skills in
science and experience in innovation. Research training will occur within one of 14 Faculty Mentor’s
laboratories, each of which has solid, continuous R01 NIH funding, and each has a strong record of successful
mentorship. Also, Trainees will develop co-mentoring relationships with at least one of our 9 Entrepreneurial
Liaison Advisors, each of whom has practical experience with translation (e.g., patents, start-ups). The SOAS
Training Program will train collaborative surgeon-scientists to become future leaders in academic surgery and
oncology to actively participate in translating innovative new discoveries into clinical cancer care."
10919760,"The function of nuclear DNA is not only determined by its sequence, but also depends on its three dimensional
(3D) structure. A particular type of DNA in eukaryotes is called heterochromatin, which refers to as tightly
packed DNA structure in the nucleus. Heterochromatin plays a critical role in genome function including DNA
structural maintenance, chromosome segregation, epigenetic inheritance, DNA replication, repair and
transcription. Recently, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of a new biological process called liquid-
liquid phase separation in the formation and function of heterochromatin. Liquid-liquid phase separation, whose
concept was borrowed from polymer sciences, is a unique process that involves the formation of
membraneless liquid droplets by proteins and nucleotides when their concentration have reached a threshold.
These liquid droplets enable the assembly and disassembly of functional protein-based organelles within a
cellular compartment following environmental cues. Hence, liquid-liquid phase separation has facilitated our
understanding of fundamental cellular information processing, cellular homeostasis, and cellular physiology.
Recently, we unexpectedly identified a new player, human 53BP1, in regulating the heterochromatin integrity
through liquid-liquid phase separation. 53BP1 was previously known as a critical player in regulating the DNA
double strand break repair. However, we discovered that the protective role of 53BP1 in both the structure and
the function of heterochromatin is distinct from its canonical activity in DNA double strand break repair. Hence,
our studies opened a new research paradigm for this important protein in signaling, biology and cellular
physiology. The goal of this proposal is to establish this new research field by addressing several unanswered
important questions regarding this new function of 53BP1. These include the molecular basis by which 53BP1
forms the liquid droplets and its significance in biology, genome biology, and cellular physiology. We have used
mass spectrometry to identify components in the liquid droplets formed by 53BP1. We will interrogate their
functions in this application. By assembling an interdisciplinary team consisting of experts on molecular and
cellular biology, proteomics, computational bioinformatics, and next generation sequencing, we will use a
combination of cell biological, molecular, biochemical, genetic, morphological, and chemical approaches to
answer these questions. Our studies will illustrate a previously uncharacterized function of 53BP1 and a novel
interplay between 53BP1 and heterochromatin and determine their impact on genome stability, facilitating our
understanding of fundamental cellular information processing, cellular homeostasis, and cellular physiology."
10795898,"Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), an excavated appearance of the optic nerve, and vision loss. The etiology of glaucoma is complex,
involving biomechanical stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, deprivation of neurotrophic factors, and epigenetic
changes. Currently, there is no clinical treatment to rescue RGCs in glaucoma patients. Therefore, effective
neuroprotective strategies and agents are needed to rescue RGCs. Epigenetic modification is an emerging and
promising novel approach to modulate cellular function in neurodegenerative diseases, however, its role in
glaucoma remains poorly defined. Our laboratory has demonstrated that sustained activation of δ-opioid receptor
by SNC-121 for 7-days offered significant long-term (42-days) RGC neuroprotection in a chronic rat glaucoma
model. This long-term neuroprotective response supports the idea that opioids induce epigenetic changes in the
retina allowing RGCs to maintain their functional integrity under conditions that normally lead to progressive
RGCs loss. Pain management studies have shown that epigenetic changes are associated with opioid-induced
tolerance and dependence that develops following chronic opioid-administration. We provided preliminary data
showing that epigenetic regulators such as class I and IIb histone deacetylases, DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs) activities and expression, and genome wide DNA methylation were significantly increased in response
to ocular hypertension-induced injury. Additionally, RNA Seq, PCR array, immunohistochemistry, and ATAC Seq
data provide significant leads that cytokines, pro-apoptotic pathways, transcriptional factors, neurotrophins, and
chromatin structure are significantly affected by ocular hypertension injury and δ-opioids treatment. We also
have shown that transcription start sites (TSS) of numerous genes in “CpG” Island were differentially affected by
δ-opioids. Based on our Preliminary Data, we hypothesize that “Activation of δ-opioid receptors induces
hyperacetylation and hypomethylation that attenuates RGCs death in glaucoma”. To test this hypothesis,
we propose the following two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1. Determine the crucial roles of class I and IIb histone
deacetylases (HDACs) in RGC death in ocular hypertensive animals. Specific Aim 2. Determine the role of DNA
methylation in δ-opioid-mediated RGC neuroprotection in ocular hypertensive animals. The outcome of the
proposed studies will not only have a positive impact on the understanding of mechanisms underlying the
opioid-mediated RGC neuroprotection, but will also identify novel and innovative targets for glaucoma therapy."

The primary objectives of the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety in Agriculture, Forestry,
and Fishing (NEC) renewal will be to: 1) create an OSH environment in the Northeast that combines research,
services and promotion to mobilize partners and catalyze community change agents to improve health and
safety in Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (AgFF) industries, and 2) to monitor the impact of these efforts in
order to improve Center programs and to measure NEC success. Specific Aims include: #1- Developing
transdisciplinary solutions for several priority OSH AgFF issues. We will seek to tackle several key issues that
prior research, stakeholder input and literature reviews indicate are problematic for AgFF industries. These
issues include the development of Total Worker Health solutions for loggers, expansion of proven lifejackets
solutions for the fishing industry, improving mental health services for the farm community, addressing tick-
borne disease in the farming industry, developing culturally relevant OSH programs in all three industries and
conducting AgFF surveillance. #2- Create a foundation for disseminating proven OSH solutions to AgFF
operations. In addition to these targeted initiatives, the NEC will provide onsite or virtual worker trainings,
respiratory fit-testing, PPE, technical assistance, emerging issues assistance, train-the trainer opportunities,
safety demonstrations, grants and cost-sharing opportunities. #3- Widely promote AgFF OSH “wins” to
empower AgFF industries. NEC solutions and resources will be available to AgFF industry groups throughout
the Northeast and beyond. The NEC intends to focus on our dual role of being both a “service” and “research”
Center and will use AgFF testimonials, safety awards, success stories and social norms promotion to send a
positive AgFF OSH message. The NEC will also engage in a “Clear Communications Campaign,” which will
involve disseminating research beyond peer-reviewed publications in places and formats that are relatable and
relevant to AgFF populations. #4- Evaluate NEC AgFF activities. The Bassett Research Institute Center for
Evaluating Rural Interventions will use multiple evaluation methods to assess, as well as improve, the NEC’s
outputs and outcomes of each of its cores."

For the past century, a major focus for Transfusion Medicine has been the immune compatibility of blood
components with added attention to the safe and appropriate use of blood products. The success of these
investigations has fueled expansive growth in the field with efforts focused on developing novel blood
components for transfusion and to generate cellular therapies. These activities require a concerted effort to link
advances in basic science with therapeutic interventions in the clinic. Transfusion Medicine Scientists and
Specialists lead the effort to train individuals to advance blood and hematopoietic cellular therapies. The
overall goal of the Program in Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapies continues to be the preparation of
M.D., M.D./Ph.D. or Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows for biomedical research careers. This long-standing program
entering its third decade has supported 80 postdoctoral fellows with over 40% of trainees being women or
underrepresented individuals. The T32 supports 8 postdoctoral fellows for 2-3 years enabling them to move on
to leading positions in academia or industry. As the field of Transfusion Medicine continues to grow, as does
the program to include the scientific areas around Immunobiology, Hematopoiesis, and Cellular Therapy. Major
strengths of our multi-disciplinary program include utilizing the strong clinical and basic research environments
at Harvard Medical School involving Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham &
Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital. In addition to scientific investigation, we have
developed programs to a) educate trainees in responsible conduct of research, grant writing, laboratory
management, and ensuring rigor and reproducibility of data b) offer opportunities to develop skills in public
speaking c) recruit and retain trainees from underrepresented or disadvantaged groups and d) maintain
academic oversight for scholarship to advance career development. Dr. John Manis will continue his role as
overall PI and has expanded the number of Program co-Directors to effectively represent both basic science
and clinical Transfusion Medicine. These leaders will be responsible for the scientific direction of the training
program, the mentoring of trainees as well as junior faculty, and monitoring milestones to ensure continued
success. We have assembled our faculty roster this year to increase contemporary scientific representation
from disciplines related to Transfusion and to better reflect the needs of our applicant pool. We believe our
approach of including broad representation of clinical, basic and translational research talent is a fundamental
strength of our program and fits well with the evolving field of Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapies. This
distinctive training approach has generated a unique environment for trainees in the Harvard Medical Area and
ours remains a highly sought-after program. The outstanding pool of applicants and recruitment of faculty
dedicated to the program has facilitated this goal. Our evolving Training Program strives to provide a unique
and rich training environment for academic transfusion biology and cellular therapies."

In this T32 renewal application, the Aflac Hematology Training Program (HTP) addresses the crucial need for
programs to train physician scientists and clinical investigators in pediatric non-malignant hematology.
Research in hematology – particularly in pediatrics – has elucidated many of the genetic, cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying disease processes, as well as fundamental cellular functions such as cell differentiation
and gene regulation. Yet despite the many scientific and clinical advances in hematology over the past decades,
the number of investigators funded by NIH for hematology related research continues to decline. This HTP offers
rigorous training in basic, translational research to postdoctoral MD, MD/PhD and PhD fellows, and in renewal is
expanded to include clinical research training. At Emory University, established research programs in sickle cell
disease, hemostasis and thrombosis, hematopoiesis and stem cell biology, gene therapy, and red cell physiology
and transfusion medicine are embedded in the largest clinical program in pediatric hematology in the country,
providing huge patient volumes for clinical and translational research within Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.
Partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology broadens the pool of 34 faculty mentors which includes 21
laboratory researchers and 13 clinical investigators supported by $37.0 M in extramural funding ($14.4 from
Federal sources). Each trainee will have a laboratory and clinical Mentor to foster basic, translational, or clinical
research relevant to pediatric hematology. Pairing of senior mentors with junior mentors from a pool of 14 young
faculty members will expand the supply of future mentors. Integrated into the highly successful Pediatric
Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Fellowship Program of the Aflac Cancer and Blood
Disorders Center, this new HTP has supported 9 trainees over its first 3 ½ years, and in renewal will admit 2
fellows each year for 2 years of support, training 8-10 MD fellows and 2-4 PhD postdoctoral fellows over 5 years.
Candidates will be MD, MD/PhD and PhD fellows within Aflac and associated laboratories, as well as external
candidates chosen for their prior training, academic potential, and commitment to research in non-malignant
hematology. In addition to rigorous laboratory research training, trainees will participate in courses on conduct of
ethical research and enhancing reproducibility, departmental career development seminars, grant writing and
academic skills training, research conferences, journal clubs, and fellowship program research retreats. Individual
Training Plans will be developed for each trainee and progress will be monitored by multidisciplinary scholarship
oversight committees. Trainees will present their work locally and at national meetings and develop applications
for career development (K-type) awards. The HTP leverages the extensive research resources of Emory
University, including formal course work and degree programs in clinical and translational research available
through Emory’s CTSA program. Renewal of this T32 will contribute to training the next generation of academic
leaders in pediatric non-malignant hematology."
10793485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart Failure has resisted the downward trend in mortality seen in other diseases and new therapies are
needed. Heart failure is driven by the hypertrophy and loss of cardiomyocytes, which comprise the bulk of the
heart by volume and provide the main contractile force necessary to move blood throughout the body. Over
90% of cardiomyocytes in mammalian species are polyploidal and/or multinucleated. These extra copies of
DNA have been studied in the context of the low regenerative capacity of the heart, yet comparatively little
effort has focused on other potential adaptive or maladaptive effects of this increased nuclearity.
Historically, the large size of the mature cardiomyocyte has precluded its analysis using unbiased single cell
RNA sequencing. Research has focused on RNAseq in isolated nuclei, which by its very nature lacks
information about nuclearity within the studied hearts. Recently, new technology has allowed for unbiased,
high-throughput single cell RNAseq of whole, mature cardiomyocytes. When the results of these single cell
studies are compared to the isolated nuclei studies, researchers find that, using the same clustering
algorithms, there are approximately twice as many distinct cellular transcriptome clusters as there are distinct
nuclear transcriptome clusters. This result suggests the existence of a form of ‘nuclear code’ in which a
multinucleated cell’s transcriptome is ‘encoded’ by nuclei drawn from two or more nuclear clusters, a result
supported by observations from other multinucleated cell populations. These encoded cells could display
differences in contractility, resistance to apoptosis, or even proliferative potential, with significant implications
for cardiac function and the development of heart failure.
The goal of this Steven I. Katz proposal is to 1) Utilize cutting edge single cell and single nucleus sequencing
technology to identify and confirm this nuclear encoding, 2) Explore the spatial distribution of mono and multi-
nucleated cells across the heart, and 3) Identify how this encoding responds to genetic and environmental
perturbations in healthy and failing hearts. As requested by the mechanism, in this proposal we set forth a
plan for an ambitious new direction for our laboratory’s research, built upon rigorous work documented in the
literature and supported by collaborators and subject matter experts. The proposal combines bioinformatic,
imaging, and next generation sequencing approaches to identify how changes in the nuclear code of
multinucleated cardiomyocytes leads to differences in response to cardiac injury and stress. Upon completion,
this grant will result in a more complete understanding of the role of multinuclearity and polyploidy in the
mammalian heart, with subsequent revelation of numerous new avenues of research for diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches to combat heart failure."
10786023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Newly released guidelines recommend increased physical activity (PA) and reduced sedentary behaviors
(SB) to improve glycemia and prevent the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Typically, 30-60
min bouts of PA are advocated per day. Although this approach increases PA, it does not decrease the length
of the sedentary periods through the day. This is important because recent epidemiological data suggest that
frequently interrupting sedentary time improves glucose control even in people who achieve the
recommended levels of PA. Our preliminary experimental data suggest that breaking up prolonged sedentary
time by performing multiple short bouts (5 min) of PA throughout the day, may improve glycemia more than
performing a single continuous bout of PA, and thereby potentially be a novel strategy to prevent T2D. The
improvement in glycemia was observed even when the total amount of PA and total energy expenditure were
matched, suggesting that how and when PA is performed over the day may matter more than how much PA
is done. However, important gaps in knowledge remain including: (1) whether similar benefits on glucose
control would be observed in adults with prediabetes, a clinically relevant population that is at high risk of
developing T2D; (2) whether these effects are sustained or diluted over time, and (3) what are the mechanistic
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we propose to measure the acute and chronic effects of PA breaks
on glucose control and the underlying mechanisms in individuals at risk of developing T2D. Sedentary men
and women with overweight or obesity and prediabetes (n=66, 50% F) will be randomized to either an
intervention designed to interrupt SB with 5-min bouts of brisk walking performed hourly for 9 hours/day, 5
days/week (BREAK) or a control condition consisting of 45-min of brisk walking performed as a single daily
continuous bout, 5 days/week (ONE). Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the greater benefits
of BREAK on glucose control may not be associated with greater improvement in insulin sensitivity but with
other mechanisms including changes in glucose fluxes. We hypothesize that because of the short duration
of exercise bouts, BREAK preferentially relies on muscle glycogen to meet energy demand. As a result,
plasma glucose is taken up by muscles to replenish glycogen stores following each active bout. Over the
day, postprandial glycemia will be reduced because of increased uptake of meal glucose. By contrast, the
ONE condition will preferentially rely on fat as fuel and has less benefit on daily glucose excursions. To test
this hypothesis, daily glucose excursions, whole-body insulin sensitivity, endogenous and exogenous glucose
kinetics, and skeletal muscle molecular pathways involved in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and
insulin action will be measured using gold standard clinical and molecular methods in our state-of-the-art
inpatient facility. The study will begin to establish the long-term beneficial health effects of breaking up SB
and may lead to new insights on strategies to control glucose to preventT2D."

Treatment of severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with deep brain stimulation (DBS) is
evolving to provide precision modulation of pathological brain circuits. One promising DBS target
for OCD is a large and complex white matter fiber bundle called the anterior limb of the internal
capsule (ALIC). A clear challenge to effective dissemination of this treatment is the lack of
specificity in targeting the necessary and sufficient ALIC pathways. To prepare DBS for broad
dissemination, we must build the knowledge and tools to enhance the precision with which
stimulation is applied to individual brains. The overarching hypothesis of the proposed research
is that DBS-mediated responses (clinical, behavioral, and electrocortical) reflect activation of
specific pathways traveling through the ALIC. In testing this hypothesis, our proposal will construct
an atlas of circuit- response maps, which can be used to guide clinical programming decisions
and enhance the precision of surgical targeting for ALIC DBS. Individuals receiving ALIC DBS to
treat OCD (n=20) will undergo 7T magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, as
well as behavioral testing at multiple time points. Aim 1 will produce a connectome blueprint that
characterizes white matter pathways implicated in effective treatment of OCD. Aim 2 provides a
patient-level, electrophysiological read-out to indicate which pathways are stimulated at
tractography-defined locations in the ALIC. Aim 3 constructs a behavioral-connectome blueprint
by linking change in task performance to DBS at tractography-defined locations in the ALIC.
Combined, this research constructs a connectomic atlas for OCD using the association of white
matter structures, electrocortical response and behavioral outcomes to specify the ideal
anatomical target for DBS."

Rural areas, where ~60 million Americans live, have a higher burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
compared to urban areas, yet, there is sparse information on T2DM risk factors and interventions that
improve T2DM primary prevention. Dr. Dugani, an academic hospitalist and early-stage investigator, is
committed to improving the primary prevention of T2DM in rural areas. His long-term goal as an
independent clinical investigator is to reduce health disparities for T2DM in rural populations by developing
patient-centered interventions for better T2DM primary prevention. The short-term goals of this proposal
are to acquire proficiency in data science, qualitative/mixed methods, health disparities research, and
clinical trial study design through a Master of Public Health degree; mentorship; and, leadership skills to
build and lead an independent research program to advance T2DM care. This research will be conducted
at Mayo Clinic, which has robust infrastructure and facilities for patient-oriented research. Dr. Dugani will
leverage data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Aim 1) and Mayo Clinic Biobank (Aims
2 and 3) to advance the research aims and also rely on a dedicated team of mentors and advisors with
expertise in T2DM, epidemiology, health disparities research, and health services research.
Dr. Dugani will accomplish his short-term goals through the novel Rural Patient Risks and Exposures for
Diabetes ConTrol (Rural PREDICT) study, which he developed to investigate the higher burden of T2DM in
Midwest rural compared to urban populations. At present, there is sparse information on risk factors for
T2DM in Midwest rural populations and no T2DM risk prediction score for Midwest rural populations.
Through Rural PREDICT, Dr. Dugani will address these knowledge gaps. Specifically, in Aim 1, he will
characterize the incidence rate and temporal trend of diabetes in the rural Midwest. In Aim 2, he will
evaluate the associations of traditional risk factors (e.g., lifestyle, socioeconomic status) and novel rural-
enriched risk factors (e.g., organic chemicals, pesticides) with incident T2DM in the rural Midwest. He will
directly engage rural patients to explore their perspectives regarding the high burden of risk factors. In Aim
3, he will develop a non-invasive (i.e., non-laboratory) 5-year T2DM risk prediction score for rural
populations and obviate the need for laboratory testing, which may be a barrier for rural populations. He will
engage patients to develop a meaningful, non-stigmatizing questionnaire for the risk score and explore
barriers to the use of this risk score. These studies will form the basis for an NIH R01 (years 4-5)
application to advance T2DM primary prevention in Midwest rural populations. His research goals align with
NIMHD's priority to reduce health disparities in minority groups, including rural communities."

 The acquisition and retention of skilled sequential movements is a fundamental part of human behavior.
We still know little about where and when plastic changes occur in the cortical motor areas to learn and
maintain skilled sequential movements. Here, we propose to study the temporal evolution of the learning and
maintenance of skilled sequential movements in primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)
by pharmacologically manipulating information storage in these areas.
 We will train monkeys to perform two tasks. In one task, the monkeys perform sequential reaching
movements guided by memory. Skill on the memory-guided sequential movements task is acquired through
considerable practice. For a control task, the monkeys perform reaching movements guided by visual cues.
Our preliminary data showed that an injection of an inhibitor for protein synthesis or an inhibitor for DNA
methylation into M1 of monkeys disrupted the performance of acquired sequential movements without affecting
the performance of visually guided reaching. We will apply these approaches to examine the nature and time
course of plasticity processes in M1 and PMd that support the learning and maintenance of extensively
practiced motor skills. First, to determine whether the neural trace for sequential movements is gradually
consolidated in M1 with extended practice, we will inject an inhibitor of protein synthesis into M1 at multiple
time points during learning of sequential movements. We hypothesize that the motor skill is repetitively
consolidated through protein synthesis every time a subject practice, and that the rate of consolidation declines
as learning proceeds. Second, to determine when PMd is involved in learning the associations between
movement elements in a sequence, we will inject an inhibitor of protein synthesis into PMd at multiple time
points during learning of sequential movements. We hypothesize that learning processes in M1 and PMd
operate in different time frames. Third, to determine whether M1 and PMd become sites of long-term storage
for the acquired sequential movements and remain critical for the maintenance of the acquired sequential
movements, we will inject an inhibitor of DNA methylation into these areas. We postulate that the injection will
disrupt the maintenance of memory-guided sequential movements after long term practice and that the
monkey will need to relearn the sequence to recover his performance after the injection.
 Completion of the proposed studies will expand our understanding of the temporal evolution of the
learning, as animals slowly become highly skilled with ongoing long-term practice and consolidation. That level
of motor sequence expertise is never studied in rodents and rarely in monkeys, yet it is a common feature of
everyday human motor performance. The results will provide information to develop new strategies for
acquiring motor skills and enhance functional recovery following stroke or traumatic brain injury."

We propose to develop and optimize an advanced neurochemical recording technique that would be able to
measure relatively rapid physiologically representative second-to-second changes in tonic concentrations of
specific neurochemicals, such as serotonin, in the brains of awake behaving animals. Microdialysis, a
commonly used in vivo sampling technique, is able to measure changes that occur in tonic levels. However, in
practice the sampling timescale is significantly limited to minute-to-minute changes and it suffers from poor
spatial resolution and induces significant tissue damage. Present voltammetry technique can provide tonic
measurement capability. However, it raises concerns for accurate quantification due to the limited approach to
eliminate background capacitive current. Furthermore, limited biofouling has been shown, limiting its use for
long-term tonic serotonin measurements in awake behaving animals. The proposed electrochemical technique
we call N-shaped Multiple Cyclic Square Wave Voltammetry (N-MCSWV) will enable second-to-second
measurements of tonic extracellular levels of serotonin with exceptional spatial resolution, sensitivity,
specificity, selectivity, and diminished biofouling. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in
neuroscience, electrochemistry, software development, and engineering to develop and validate this novel
neurochemical recording technology for broad use in basic neuroscience research, clinical brain
neuromodulation, and a variety of electrochemical applications. Our initial animal studies will guide and inform
the application of our investigational technique for use by the general neuroscience and medical community.
Our proposal seeks to (1) establish N-MCSWV as a reliable research tool that is capable of identifying and
quantifying tonic serotonin extracellular levels in vivo with unsurpassed sensitivity, selectivity, and minimize
biofouling, (2) apply Fourier transform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to N-MCSWV to monitor the
degree of electrode biofouling in vivo, and (3) validate the use of N-MCSWV for in vivo, acutely and chronically,
selective measurement of tonic serotonin concentrations."
10799560,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
The skin functions as a potent immune organ, rendering the readily accessible cutaneous
microenvironment an attractive target that can be locally engineered to induce and regulate
systemic immune responses. Increasing age is associated with changes in immune function
(immunosenescence) that result in increased susceptibility to diseases and poor vaccine
responses in older adults. This proposal is designed to bring together very recent and significant
advances in dermatology and skin biology to address critical problems in human health. Here, we
specifically focus on the skin microenvironment and strategies for cutaneous immunomodulation.
The overall approach is to utilize a clinically applicable dissolvable microneedle array delivery
platform we have developed to locally engineer the highly adaptive and immunoresponsive skin
microenvironment. Specifically, we propose to modulate local immune regulatory circuits in the
skin to enable the induction and regulation of systemic immune responses. The studies we
propose will investigate the effect of locally delivered immune modulators on the mechanisms
underlying cutaneous immune regulation in young and aged skin. Importantly, our studies include
translational studies using living human skin to enable the rapid advancement of novel cutaneous
immunomodulation strategies into clinical trials. The proposed studies will result in a better
understanding of skin immunobiology specifically relevant to the development of safe and
predictable skin immunoengineering strategies to regulate systemic immune responses across
the lifespan."
10762452,"Maintaining the balance of excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA signaling is critical for homeostasis and
generating proper reflexes in response to hypoxia. Our previous studies established glutamate signaling in the
nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS), the first central site for carotid body sensory integration, is exaggerated after
chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). However, the specific contribution of GABA, which counter-balances
glutamate signaling, in the exaggerated excitation is unknown. Our current goal is to address this knowledge
gap and determine the extent that inhibitory GABA signaling contributes to overexcitation of the nTS after CIH.
GABA signaling is controlled or modulated by GABA release, receptor (GABARs) activation, the chloride (Cl-)
equilibrium potential that is set by Cl- co-transporters (NKCC1 and KCC2), and astrocytic GABA uptake via
transporters (GATs). Given the present literature and our supporting preliminary data, our overarching
hypothesis is that CIH shifts nTS activity to an overexcited state due to attenuated GABA signaling via reduced
GABA inhibition and increased astrocyte GAT activity. Reduced GABA tips the balance of Glu and GABA
signaling, and their influence on each other (i.e., cross-talk), towards greater excitation to ultimately increase
chemoreflex responses. Aim 1 will determine the extent GABA signaling is altered in CIH to increase nTS
excitability. Working hypothesis: Reduced GABA inhibition increases nTS excitability and cardiorespiratory
function in CIH. GABA inhibition is attenuated in CIH due to reduced GABA release or GABARs on Glu
neurons, altered Cl- transport and/or augmented astrocyte GAT. Aim 2 will define the magnitude nTS GABA
and astrocyte GABA transporters influence Glu signaling in CIH to control neuronal and cardiorespiratory
function. Working hypothesis: GABA-Glu balance is shifted towards excitation after CIH, in part due to altered
GAT function, to ultimately to increase nTS excitability and cardiorespiratory function. In this application, we
will utilize a multi-faceted, synergistic and integrative approach. We will use a range of techniques including
single cell electrophysiology, live-cell imaging, DREADD cellular manipulation and molecular biology to
ultimately decipher physiological function. We will also use AAV expression and Cre-technology in transgenic
rats that allows specific recording and manipulation in GABA neurons from the single cell to whole animal.
Each technique directly complements the other, allowing an unparalleled depth of study. Together, these
techniques allow the vertical study of the system and meticulous cellular investigation. Upon completion of the
proposed research, we expect to identify the significance and mechanisms of elevated nTS activity due to
reduced GABA signaling that result in cardiorespiratory abnormalities in IH diseases."
10798342,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Everyday experience requires humans to make plans in a hierarchical fashion, so they can anticipate visual
events that might occur seconds, minutes, hours, or longer in the future. For example, when walking through a
city, individuals must track their immediate surroundings (e.g., the movement of pedestrians around them),
intermediate sub-goals (e.g., landmarks along their route), and long-timescale goals (e.g., their final destination).
Despite the ubiquity of such hierarchical anticipation in behavior, it is unclear how the brain can simultaneously
anticipate events at multiple timescales. Our aim is to uncover the mechanisms underlying hierarchical
anticipatory signals in the brain’s visual system, by determining how these signals form, what they represent,
how they are updated, and how they guide future-oriented behavior. This will be accomplished with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuropsychological studies, naturalistic stimuli, computational models, and
sophisticated analytic approaches for characterizing the dynamics of brain activity. These methods will determine
the conditions under which the visual system generates hierarchical anticipatory signals, the content and
flexibility of those signals, how they arise, and their consequences for behavior. Aim 1 will establish how
hierarchical anticipatory signals form and what they represent. We hypothesize that such hierarchical anticipation
depends on input from memory systems, is informed by pre-existing schema, and is flexible in the visual features
and timescales represented. Aim 2 will determine how hierarchical anticipatory signals may be affected by top-
down goals to simulate the future, and how these signals relate to future-oriented visual behavior at a range of
timescales. We hypothesize that the visual hierarchy differentially updates its anticipatory signals when the
environment or goals change, and generates predictive signals in novel situations by linking separate episodic
memories. Finally, Aim 3 will test competing theories of the structure of anticipatory representations. We
hypothesize that anticipatory representations are influenced by both temporal and semantic relationships within
an event sequence, and propose a computational model for predicting anticipatory event representations learned
from a temporally-structured stimulus. Together, the findings will elucidate the mechanisms by which the visual
system forms and flexibly updates anticipatory representations at multiple timescales, and how these
representations relate to anticipatory behavior in naturalistic conditions. Such insights are important because
expectations are instrumental in allowing individuals to behave adaptively, and disruption of visual anticipation
might broadly impair goal-directed behavior. This work will therefore shed light on how the capacity to anticipate
upcoming events to adaptively guide behavior might be impaired following damage to different parts of the visual
system, including higher-order areas whose damage is not associated with primary visual deficits. Together, the
results will provide empirical tests of the structure and development of anticipatory signals across the visual
hierarchy, informing theories that consider the brain to be a fundamentally predictive organ."

Maintenance of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis is essential to preserve cell integrity and vital
for the survival and growth of almost all life. In multicellular organisms, ROS is actively generated outside of
the cell or near the cell membrane to protect against invading pathogens as well as in normal physiological
processes such as hormone biosynthesis. However, ROS are generally associated with causing damage to
proteins and DNA within cells. Excessive ROS production leads to oxidative stress and contributes to the
development of many chronic conditions such as aging, cancer, diabetes, cardiac disorders, and
neurodegenerative diseases. The NADPH oxidases, a family of membrane enzymes whose primary function is
to produce ROS, play an essential role in maintaining ROS homeostasis and thus serve as valid drug targets
for combatting numerous diseases associated with oxidative stress. NADPH oxidases generate ROS by
catalyzing cross-membrane electron transfer from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular oxygen. Mammals encode
seven NADPH oxidases: DUOX1-2 and NOX1-5. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanism
governing the activation and regulation of NADPH oxidase proteins, representing a critical knowledge gap. In
this proposal, an interdisciplinary research program will be established to study the working mechanism of
NADPH oxidases by combining cutting-edge structural biology techniques such as single-particle cryoEM with
biochemical, biophysical, and cell biology approaches. We aim to address the two fundamental questions
underlying the catalytic activity of NADPH oxidases: i) how do NADPH oxidases mediate cross-membrane
electron transfer to catalyze the production of ROS? And ii) how is the catalytic function of NADPH
oxidases activated and regulated at the molecular level? Using the DUOX1 as an example, we will
establish a molecular paradigm for understanding the structure-function relationship of NADPH oxidases. The
outcomes of our studies will advance our fundamental understanding of the NADPH oxidase biology and lay
the foundation for novel drug development strategies to combat oxidative stress."

The heart consists of a multitude of diverse cardiac cell types, including but not limited to cardiomyocytes,
cardiac fibroblasts, epicardial cells, endothelial/endocardial cells and smooth muscle cells, which coordinate to
sustain cardiac function and circulation throughout the body. Thus, regulated maintenance of these cell types
is crucial for optimal heart performance and disrupting the function of specific cell lineages can result in distinct
heart diseases including heart failure, which is a major leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. However, what are the specific cell lineages affected during heart failure and how do gene
regulatory networks control genetic programs that direct their pathologic outcomes are key biomedical
questions that remain to be resolved. To address these issues, we have created an interdisciplinary team that
includes physician-scientists who will collect patient heart tissue samples to investigate molecular mechanisms
involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure; genomic and epigenomic experts who will employ cutting-edge
single-cell sequencing and chromatin analysis technologies to examine cell-type specific chromatin
accessibility-interactions and corresponding gene expression; and stem cell biologists who will utilize human
pluripotent stem cell cardiac models and state-of-the-art genome-editing strategies to perform functional
confirmation studies. Through these integrative efforts and analyses, we plan to examine the hypothesis that
cis-regulatory elements and their enhancer-promoter interactions dynamically function and coordinate in a cell-
type specific manner to direct lineage-specific gene expression during cardiac tissue homeostasis, and altering
these highly-regulated cell-type specific cis-regulatory elements and corresponding gene regulatory networks
can lead to heart failure. Specifically, we propose to 1) identify cis-regulatory elements and cell-types that are
affected by heart failure-associated non-coding genetic variants; 2) investigate how gene regulatory networks
controlling specific cardiovascular cell-types are altered during heart failure; and 3) examine how perturbations
of cell-type specific cis-regulatory elements and gene regulatory networks during heart failure impact cell
function and gene expression."

 GABAergic neurons of the dorsolateral hypothalamus play an essential role in both the regulating the
sleep/wake cycle, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control their development. We have
recently found that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lhx6 is necessary for development of a population
of sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons in the zona incerta in the hypothalamus. Lhx6 is essential for
development and migration of most telencephalic interneurons, in the hypothalamus Lhx6 is expressed in a much
more restricted subset of neurons that do not express markers of telencephalic Lhx6-positive interneurons. The
role of Lhx6 in development of telencephalic and hypothalamic neurons differs in several important respects.
Lhx6 expression is regulated by different transcription factors in the two regions. Preliminary gene expression
analysis has identified a number of genes that are strong candidates for mediating these differences. In this
proposal, we aim to identify the molecular mechanisms that guide the specification and survival of hypothalamic
Lhx6 neurons. First, we will use a combination of genetic approaches to identify transcriptional regulatory
networks that are required for initiation and maintenance of hypothalamic expression of Lhx6, and that control
development of distinct subtypes of Lhx6-positive neurons. Next, we will determine whether tangential cell
migration plays a critical role in the localization of sleep-promoting Lhx6-positive neurons, and identify the
molecular mechanisms that control this process. Finally, we will identify molecular subtypes of sleep-activated
Lhx6-positive hypothalamic neurons, and investigate how mutants that disrupt the development of these neurons
result in altered regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. This will provide insight into molecular pathways that control
the assembly of key components of hypothalamic neural circuitry, and may identify therapeutic targets for
treatment of sleep disorders."
10758255,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Highly disruptive truncating mutations to protein-coding genes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) affect nearly 10%
of all cancers and predominantly arise heteroplasmically, affecting a fraction of the total mtDNA pool. Although
decades of investigation into pathogenic mtDNA variants in the germline have established that they profoundly
disrupt normal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the effects of such mutations in cancer cells are largely
unknown. The fundamental barrier to rigorous interrogation of mtDNA mutations in cancer cells has been a lack
of tools for genetically engineering mtDNA. Recently, a new mtDNA-editing technology pairing TALE binding
domains to a DddAtox cytosine base editor (DdCBE) has been successfully used to introduce point mutations
into mtDNA, revolutionizing the ability to genetically manipulate mtDNA with high precision. In parallel, our team
recently discovered that truncating mtDNA mutations are under strong positive selection in specific genetic
contexts (subunits of NADH dehydrogenase/Complex I, “CI”) and cancer lineages (colorectal, kidney, and thyroid
cancers), and that the heteroplasmic dosage and transcriptional phenotype of these mutations are readily
detectable in single cell sequencing data. These convergent discoveries motivated our team to engineer DdCBEs
to introduce truncating mutations to several CI and non-CI mtDNA genes in cell lines, enabling for the first time
a functional interrogation of truncating mtDNA mutations in cancer cells. Using these tools, we propose
integrative computational/experimental studies to test the overarching hypothesis that CI-truncating mutations
produce physiologically significant and therapeutically actionable metabolic changes in tumors. In Aim 1, we will
computationally investigate mtDNA mutation patterns across ~100,000 tumor samples, identifying recurrent
mutant alleles and co-incident driver mutations in nuclear DNA. In parallel, we will express DdCBEs to model CI-
and non-CI truncating mutations in colorectal cancer cell lines, and define the molecular phenotypes conferred
by CI truncating mutations using transcriptomic, metabolomic, and isotope tracing experiments. Our Preliminary
Data indicates that the phenotype of CI-truncating mutations depends on their heteroplasmic dosage. Thus, in
Aim 2 we will use transient expression of DdCBEs to produce isogenic panels of colorectal cancer cell lines at
characteristically distinct mutation dosages. Using a combination of single cell and bulk molecular profiling, we
will test the hypothesis that CI-truncating mutations rewire tumor cell metabolism towards a pro-proliferative
configuration in a dosage-sensitive manner. Finally, hypothesizing that CI-truncating mutations induce genetic
dependencies absent in mtDNA-wild-type cells, Aim 3 will use DdCBE-engineered cell line models to identify,
validate, and mechanistically study novel synthetic lethalities associated with CI-truncating mutations. The
results of these studies will deliver a new, detailed understanding of the function, dosage sensitivity, and
therapeutic vulnerability of one of the most common genetic insults in the cancer genome."

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world, with 30-50% of patients
progressing to end-stage kidney disease. Diagnosis is biopsy-based, with routine immunofluorescence
showing IgA (co)dominant immunodeposits usually with C3 and often with IgG co-deposits. IgA in the
immunodeposits is of IgA1 subclass and enriched for galactose-deficient IgA1 glycoforms (Gd-IgA1). There is
currently no disease specific therapy for IgAN due to our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of disease progression. Recent data indicate that IgG is present in immunodeposits of virtually all IgAN
patients and that it is enriched for Gd-IgA1-specific autoantibodies. Furthermore, Gd-IgA1 and anti-Gd-IgA1
IgG autoantibodies are elevated in the circulation of IgAN patients and their levels predict disease progression.
Based on these, and other data, we have proposed a multi-hit hypothesis explaining the autoimmune nature of
IgAN: Gd-IgA1 is elevated in circulation of IgAN patients and is recognized by anti-Gd-IgA1 IgG
autoantibodies, resulting in the formation of circulating immune complexes, some of which deposit in the
glomeruli, inciting renal injury. The origin of the autoantigen and the characteristics of specific cell population(s)
producing Gd-IgA1 remain unknown. Recently, we showed that immortalized IgA1-secreting cells from IgAN
patients produce more Gd-IgA1 autoantigen compared to the cells from healthy controls. Furthermore, only
these IgAN-derived cells increase Gd-IgA1 production in response to cytokine stimulation (e.g., IL-6). Follow
up analysis found enhanced STAT3 and STAT1 activation only in IgAN B cells, and that it was necessary for
Gd-IgA1 production following cytokine stimulation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cytokine stimulated B
cells from IgAN patients found IgHA1-subpopulations with abnormal expression of genes responsible for
regulation of multiple cytokine signaling pathways. These IgHA1-subpopulations also exhibited abnormal
alterations in the expression level of glycosyltransferase enzymes relevant to IgA1 glycosylation.
Transcriptional data alone does not identify Gd-IgA1 producers. To address this, we developed a novel
glycophenotyping method using lectins and recombinant anti-Gd-IgA1 IgG that can target cell surface
presentation of Gd-IgA1. This process enriched for low and high Gd-IgA1-producing subpopulations, which had
differential activation of transcriptional factors before and after cytokine stimulation. Using this
glycophenotyping method with nucleotide conjugation, we can target Gd-IgA1-producing cells for transcriptome
analysis, intracellular signaling staining, chromatin remodeling, and specific autoantigen production rates.
Together, these studies will elucidate the mechanisms of autoantigen production within specific subpopulations
of IgA1-producing cells and potentially lead to the development of new disease therapies for IgAN."

10927198,"Hookworms are serious parasites of humans and animals, causing anemia and even death in heavy infections
and vulnerable populations. Nearly 500 million people are infected with hookworms, primarily in developing
countries lacking sanitation infrastructure. Canine hookworms are the most important gastrointestinal parasite
of dogs. Hookworms can be controlled using several anthelmintics, which in the absence of a vaccine, remain
the only available control for hookworm infections. However, heavy use of anthelmintics has led to the
development of genetic resistance to all the major anthelmintics used to treat parasitic nematodes in livestock.
Increased use of anthelmintics to treat humans is predicted to lead to anthelmintic resistance (AR) in
hookworms as well. Indeed, heavy use of anthelmintics in racing greyhounds has led to the emergence of
multidrug resistant (MDR) canine hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum). These MDR isolates are resistant to all
classes of anthelmintics approved for use in dogs in the US. Recently, MDR hookworms have spread from
greyhounds into the general pet dog population and are predicted to continue this spread in the future. Not only
will MDR hookworms negatively affect the ability to treated infected dogs, they will also severely limit treatment
options for zoonotic hookworm infections in humans such as cutaneous larva migrans, eosinophilic enteritis
and diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat
infections with MDR hookworms. Development of anthelmintics requires adult parasites to test potential
compounds for activity in vitro, and infected hosts to test the efficacy of potential drugs. This is hampered by
the lack of a small animal model for hookworm infections in which to test new drugs. Ancylostoma caninum can
currently only be maintained in dogs, making anthelmintic development and testing costly and ethically
problematic. Therefore, we propose a two-pronged approach to developing a rodent model for canine
hookworm infection. In Aim 1, we will use drugs to immunosuppress potential rodent hosts before and during
infection to determine if the animals can be permissive to MDR hookworm infection. We will also test
immunodeficient rodents for their ability to host A. caninum. In Aim 2, we will use the rodent model to test
current anthelmintics as a proof of principle. A small animal model of canine hookworm infection would greatly
facilitate the development of anthelmintics effective against MDR worms and would provide insights into the
development of AR in hookworms that are applicable to hookworm infections of humans."

Metabolic and bariatric surgery is an emerging option to treat obesity-related metabolic diseases, e.g., type 2
diabetes, and prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Metabolic surgery can profoundly alter
the gut microbiota; meanwhile, gut microbiota and their metabolites may affect cardiometabolic outcomes after
the surgery. Investigation of these “host-microbiota interactions” will offer novel mechanistic understanding of
metabolic surgery and evidence for developing potential microbiota-based models/therapies to achieve better
cardiometabolic health. Yet, longitudinal patient studies that examined pre- to post-surgery gut microbiota and
their metabolites in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes are scarce. Existing studies are limited by small
sample sizes XVXDOO\ Q , non-prospective design, no evaluation of microbial functionality nor activity (e.g.,
via multi-omics), and little consideration of diet or medication use. Of note, no studies have evaluated gut
microbiota in relation to estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, which reflects the overall cardiometabolic benefit of
metabolic surgery and is widely used in clinical practice per ACC/AHA guideline. Furthermore, no studies have
included African Americans (AAs), a population with high rates of cardiometabolic diseases.
 We aim to fill these research gaps by establishing a longitudinal, multi-ethnic cohort of metabolic surgery
patients and applying multi-omics to identify microbial features (e.g., species, pathways, and metabolites)
associated with estimated 10-year ASCVD risk and/or improvements in A1C, blood pressure, and blood lipids.
In a pilot study, we enrolled 20 patients (including AAs), collected longitudinal stool/blood samples, conducted
surveys, and found significant changes in microbiome and microbial metabolites after surgery, demonstrating
the feasibility and our ability to carry out the proposed full-scale study. Specifically, we will enroll and follow 200
patients to collect biospecimen and conduct surveys at pre-surgery and 3-month and 1-year post-surgery visits.
We will evaluate pre- to post-surgery changes in gut microbiome and fecal and circulating levels of metabolites,
especially microbiota-derived metabolites, and the prospective associations of pre-surgery and 3-month
microbiome and metabolites with ASCVD risk and metabolic outcomes at 1-year post-surgery. We will also
explore potential effect modifications by diet and medication, focusing on fiber intake and metformin use.
 Our proposed research will provide substantial novel data to advance our understanding of the role of gut
microbiota in cardiometabolic improvements after metabolic surgery, which may translate into novel microbial
approaches to identify and treat patients for better cardiometabolic health. Our team has extensive expertise in
cardiometabolic diseases, diet-microbiota-host interactions, metagenomics and metabolomics in longitudinal
cohorts, as well as in metabolic surgery with experiences as patients, care providers, and/or researchers, and
thus, is uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed research."

targeted and global characterization of Project samples in a quantitative, reproducible, and efficient manner. The
core brings together cutting-edge tools and the expertise of leading systems biologists in three critical areas: (1)
Proteomics led by Dr. Nevan Krogan at the J. David Gladstone Institutes; (2) Transcriptomics and Epigenetics
led by Drs. Chris Benner and Ivan Marazzi at the University of California, San Diego and the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai; and (3) Viral Reverse Genetics led by Dr. Luis Martinez-Sobrido at the Texas
Biomedical Research Institute. The Technology Core will be responsible for processing and analyzing both in
vivo samples from infected patients and mice (Project 1) as well as ex vivo infected samples in primary and
immortalized cells (Projects 1 and 2). The generated data will be processed, analyzed and stored in
collaboration with the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. Data integration will be performed by the
Modeling Core to discover key drivers of coronavirus infection, transmission, host response, and host tropism
as potential nodes for therapeutic intervention. Further integration of -OMICs data with longitudinal clinical data
derived from patient cohorts will identify biomarkers of disease severity. The Technology Core will provide
recombinant viruses (including reporter, deletion, and point mutation) and -OMICs services for essential
functional and mechanistic follow-up studies probing the molecular mechanism of the critical drivers identified in
each respective Project. This iterative cycle from networks-to-mechanism is driven by our effective collaborative
efforts that unites multiple labs to optimally leverage best-in-class -OMICs approaches that rely on high-level
specialized equipment and domain-specific expertise.
The Technology Core has the unique challenge of processing coordinated samples and generating and
integrating systems data spanning chromatin modifications and architecture, gene expression, protein
abundance, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. In the previous iteration (the
FluOMICs consortium), Drs. Benner and Krogan have successfully tackled these challenges and derived
standardized protocols for sample generation, processing, and analysis across different cores and institutes.
More recently, Drs. Marazzi and Martinez-Sobrido, who have already established relationships with FluOMICs
team members, joined new collaborative efforts to study coronaviruses. Formalizing this relationship as a single
core under the leadership of Dr. Krogan, an internationally recognized expert in the design and application of
systems biology approaches to interrogate host-pathogen interactions, the Technology Core is ideally
positioned to effectively coordinate Technology Core labs to implement previously developed pipelines under
FluOMICS 1.0 and 2.0 and develop new approaches for the accomplishment of SYBIL Aims."

process that now has 45 PhDs. Admission into our PREP is very competitive at less than 10% with an
applicant pool that is national, including applicants from Puerto Rico and the US Territories. Based on this
success, we propose to add an additional slot to each cohort, for a total of 45 trainees. In the current cycle
(2018-2023), and including the gap year of support (2017), 22/29 or 76% of those who completed PREP,
matriculated into Ph.D. programs at institutions such as Columbia, UNC, Yale, and the University of
California (Davis, Irvine, and San Diego). In addition to the diversity of our applicants, the diversity of
disciplines was also extensive ranging from biomedical engineering to neuroscience and computational
modeling. Our unique and impactful program includes distinct activities that target three overlapping phases
of each trainee’s tenure: “Moving in”, “Moving through”, and “Moving out.” The research education and
mentoring activities in the “Moving in” phase are structured to enable easy transition to VT and a rural college
town, and to learn about the trainees and for the trainees to learn about biomedical science and what it will
take to succeed as a PREP scholar. Informed by our assessment in earlier cycles, the mentor selection
process continues to be scholar-driven following three 4-week mini lab rotations each. During the “Moving
through” phase, each trainee has individualized educational activities and mentoring structured to enable
success in gaining admission to top PhD programs. Complementing these educational activities is a seminar
series, which starts during the “Moving in Bootcamp,” entitled “Getting into and Succeeding in Graduate
School.” All the speakers are PREP alums at least two years post PREP. In the “Moving out” phase, research
training becomes a top priority and communications skills, including writing and oral, are further enhanced
to help with graduate school interviews and in identity construction. Although we are proposing to continue
using a training approach that has been very effective, a new training tool that is unique to VT PREP are
the lived experiences of our PREP/IMSD alumni, 86 of whom have a PhD and are pursuing careers in
academia, industry, the NIH, and private institutions. These alums and those still in training will be “virtual”
alumni mentors. Dr. Achenie brings significant experience in mentoring students as a tenured professor
with a background in mathematical modeling and quantitative skills. These complement the leadership and
genomic training of the PD, which have been the hallmark of VT PREP for the last three cycles. Institutional
support will continue to be very strong, mentor training will continue to be a part of our “moving in phase,”

10831957,"Interventional Oncology (IO) is emerging as the fourth pillar of cancer care alongside
medical, radiation, and surgical oncology. Interventional oncologists provide minimally invasive
image-guided therapies to treat cancers without the toxicities and disfigurement of chemotherapy,
radiation or surgery. New clinical trial designs and collaborations are essential to determine how
and when IO therapies should be integrated into multidisciplinary care plans to achieve optimal
outcomes for cancer patients. Obstacles to this are many. Trial designs must accommodate
staged and repeatable therapies, which complicates time-to-event analysis. There is a dearth of
interventional oncology clinical investigators, who are needed to build collaborations with other
oncologic disciplines to develop new concepts and protocols for clinical trials. The NCI
cooperative group hierarchy is the domain of medical oncology. Surgical and interventional
concepts struggle to hurdle the many layers of the review process, which is a barrier to the
recruitment and retention of young investigators. Less than 5% of the >100 NCTN trials open at
the applicant’s cancer center involve more than one cancer specialty, a stark indicator of the
deficit in interdisciplinary clinical research. Conducting interdisciplinary trials is fraught with
logistical and administrative challenges when the treating physicians practice in different
departments, which historically is a major determinant of trial failure.
 The role of a senior IO clinical research specialist is to address each of these obstacles at
the institutional and NCTN level. This starts with teaching clinical trial design and execution to a
new cadre of young investigators from all cancer disciplines. Interdisciplinary collaborations can
then be created within and across NCTN institutions to generate new trial concepts investigating
the intersection of systemic and image-guided therapies to create new therapeutic synergies.
Areas ripe for investigation include potentiation of ischemia by targeting HIF activation,
autophagy, and free radical generation; potentiation of selective internal radiation with
radiosensitizers; potentiation of thermal-based therapies to improve ablation margins; ablation
and embolization as immunostimulants to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibition; image-guided
delivery of CAR-T cells into solid tumors; direct injection and intralymphatic administration of
vaccine-based agents; and nanoconstructs for delivery of therapeutic agents. These novel
concepts need to be guided through the labyrinthian NCTN process, and new platforms
developed for execution of interdepartmental clinical trials."

Nitrogenase catalyzes the ambient conversion of N2 to NH3 at its M-cluster site. This reaction
represents a major source of the usable form of nitrogen that supports the existence of human
population. As such, understanding how this enzyme effects ambient conversion of N2 to NH3 is
of significant relevance to human health. Our recent structural observation of asymmetric belt
sulfur displacements with distinct dinitrogen species in the two M-clusters of Mo-nitrogenase
invokes a novel mechanism of N2 reduction that necessitates dynamic structural
rearrangements of the M-clusters during catalysis. Using combined genetic, biochemical,
spectroscopic and structural approaches, we propose to investigate this novel mechanism of N2
reduction by demonstrating the stepwise mechanism of N2 reduction via cluster rotation,
assigning individual catalytic events at the three belt-sulfur sites of the M-cluster, and illustrating
the alternate binding of Fe protein to the two MoFe protein dimers that drives the asynchronous
cluster rotation in these dimers. Through our proposed studies, we hope to illustrate the
dynamic structural rearrangements of the active site of Mo-nitrogenase during N2 reduction and
establish a framework for further mechanistic exploration of this intricate reaction. Investigations
along this line could prove instrumental in (re)calibrating the mechanistic thinking of
nitrogenase, as all mechanistic studies to date have assumed that N2 reduction occurs at a
single site of a uniform M-cluster species that is structurally `static' during catalysis. These
efforts, if successful, will not only lead to a molecular depiction of the intricate catalytic
mechanism of nitrogenase, but also facilitate development of nitrogenase-based applications in
the long run."

problems identified from clinical management of lung airway, interstitial and vascular diseases and to extend the
new discoveries from genetic, genomic, cell and molecular studies to define pathogenic mechanisms and
develop novel therapeutic interventions for lung diseases. We remain focused on the importance of integrated

science has broadened to include strength in genetics, (epi)genomics, molecular and cellular biology. While we
view our science as cutting edge, we pride ourselves on the fact that our trainees do not just focus on a single
molecule or gene but rather keep in mind the importance of integrated function and translational research. Our
MPIs include diverse strengths in Pulmonary, Sleep, Genomics, Critical Care, Physiology and Respiratory
Science. The MPIs have mutual respect, complementary expertise, shared vision for scientific progress and a
strong commitment to developing a superb next generation of leaders with rich diversity. To improve the quality
of mentoring, we also removed less effective mentors while adding more R01-funded preceptors and formalizing
the levels of faculty participation based on success in research training, research productivity and current
research funding. We have made both Sleep and Pediatrics as major scientific foci, addressing major national
shortages in these areas. We utilize individual development plans, overseen by the MPIs, Preceptors and senior
advisors, for all of our trainees to empower people with diverse backgrounds. We promote collaboration between
MDs and PhDs, ensure that everyone has experience and competency in inter-, trans- and multi-disciplinary
research, and ensure all of our trainees have a strong foundation in physiological approaches that provides a
clinical context for research problems studied at any level. We promote cohesiveness, team spirit and a unique
identity for our trainees via common activities involving all of our trainees and mentors/preceptors such as
frequent scholarly meetings, career development sessions and quarterly retreats. We are committed to a training
program that includes every phase of academic career development, from ‘cradle to grave’ including developing
junior faculty into independent investigators, and even improving the mentoring skills in our senior faculty. We
also remain committed to diversifying the next generation of respiratory scientists as demonstrated by our long-
term track record and recent recruitments. The lack of a robust pipeline for multidisciplinary researchers who can
apply modern integrative approaches to problems in respiratory science is a crisis which has been further
amplified by the COVID pandemic, but it is a challenge that we are well-qualified and eager to address."

Cardiovascular disease is the number cause of death in the United States. Most cardiovascular diseases are
associated with an increase in myocardial mass or cardiac hypertrophy. The heart responds to exercise and
other stress through an increase in cardiomyocyte in size in order to produce more force and cope with the
increased demand. In addition to signaling pathways that are activated within cardiomyocytes, other cellular
changes occur in response to cardiac stress. Some of these changes are adaptive but others are maladaptive.
Although many therapies are available for heart failure, we are still not able to prevent maladaptive changes in
response to stress. Prevention of maladaptive remodeling can lead to the ultimate avoidance of heart failure. We
have acquired preliminary data using innovative technologies showing that macrophages and B cells are
activated in the early adaptive phase in response to cardiac stress. Our hypothesis is that cardiac resident
macrophages promote adaptive, compensatory remodeling during cardiac stress in a process that is regulated
by B cells. Based on our preliminary findings, we are proposing to determine the role of macrophages in the
early adaptive phase of cardiac remodeling during pathological and physiological stress (Aim 1), investigate the
origins and mechanisms of resident macrophage activation during hypertrophy (Aim 2), and identify the
mechanisms by which B cells influence macrophage function during cardiac stress (Aim 3). Throughout the
proposal we will use innovative techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and advanced imaging
strategies, to probe the role of macrophages and B cells in cardiac remodeling. The ultimate goal of the current
proposal is to identify a possible adaptive role of macrophage early during the remodeling process. Using these
discoveries, future research will focus on developing novel therapeutics to enhance adaptive remodeling and
inhibiting maladaptive remodeling. Given the impact of cardiovascular disease on overall health, this proposal
holds great promise for reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease on our society."

The mission of the Molecular Cytology Core is to deliver cutting-edge, specialized services in support of
research projects at the Center. The methodologies employed by the Core allow for the detection in situ (in
cells, tissue sections, organoids and whole mounts) of biomarkers (proteins, glycoproteins, lipids, nucleic
acids) and molecular processess in normal and pathological conditions. The precise localization of the
biomarkers is achieved by optical imaging of fixed and live samples. Several molecular markers (up to seven)
can be vizualized simultanously or sequentially in the same sample by multiplex staining, using machine-based
protocols. In collaboration with its users, the Core performs comprehensive antibody validations. The Core
trains investigators in basic staining principles and assists them in performing manual experiments. The optical
imaging modalities within the Core allow for wide field imaging and confocal imaging of tissue sections, thick
and cleared tissue samples, cells, live embryos, tumors in live mice, etc. Super-resolution imaging is performed
as well as confocal imaging in the IR range to visualize nanomaterials and drugs. With the newly acquired
module for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) imaging, researchers can study the dynamic behavior
of biomolecules. The Core scans user slides with four digital slide scanners, one of which has confocal
capabilities. The scanning generates large volumes of data and serves as a valuable resource for image
analysis. Microscopy staff provides strong support for the users with 2D and 3D image analysis. The Core’s
Atomic Force microscope is heavily used to study molecular interactions with nanometer resolution, to evaluate
the effect of inhibitors on pathologic processes, and to assess stiffness of tissues from normal and cancer-
bearing animals as well as tissues from cancer patients."
10794970,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cumulative epidemiological and experimental evidence have shown that exposure to air pollutants leads to
increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These associations have been mostly ascribed to the
particulate matter (PM) components. We have found that exposures to ambient ultrafine particles (UFP), with an
aerodynamic diameter less than 0.18 µm, and/or diesel exhaust, rich in ultrafine PM, lead to enhanced lipid
peroxidation, metabolic derangements, liver steatosis and atherosclerosis. Inhalation of PM exerts prooxidant
actions in the lungs but the mechanisms as to how pulmonary effects are translated into systemic toxicity are
still unknown. PM exposure also triggers antioxidant responses in pulmonary and systemic tissues, including
activation of transcription factor Nrf2 and upregulation of its target gene heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which
attempt to counteract the ensuing harmful effects. The observations that particle uptake by alveolar
macrophages significantly correlates with the development of atherosclerotic plaques strongly suggest that these
cells are likely mediators in translating effects from the lungs to the systemic tissues. Our overarching hypothesis
is that PM exposure promotes cardiometabolic toxicity starting with oxidative actions in the lungs that lead to
prooxidant and proinflammatory effects in the circulating blood and systemic tissues via activation of alveolar
macrophages, all modulated by the degree of myeloid anti-oxidant protection. We will test this hypothesis via the
following three specific aims: 1) Assess the kinetics and mechanisms of lipid peroxidation in the lungs after
ultrafine particle exposure, and their relation to prooxidant effects in the circulating blood and the development
of atherosclerosis. We will use lipid peroxidation byproducts as tracking signals of PM-induced biological effects,
and assess the kinetics of their appearance in various tissues such as the lungs, blood, liver, adipose tissue and
aorta of ApoE KO mice exposed to ultrafine particles vs. filtered air for various times. 2) Determine if the myeloid
antioxidant defense protects against UFP-induced lipid peroxidation, pulmonary and cardiometabolic toxicity.
Myeloid-specific Nrf2 and HO-1 KO mice as well as myeloid-specific HO-1 Transgenic overexpresser mice in
the ApoE null background, recently developed by us, will be used to test the effects of decreased or increased
antioxidant defense, respectively, in the toxicity induced by UFP. 3) Evaluate whether alveolar macrophages
carry UFP-induced oxidative effects from the lungs to the circulating blood. We will develop alveolar and lung
macrophage chimeras with ablated HO-1 in their alveolar/interstitial macrophages to dissect their contribution in
translating effects from the lungs into the systemic vessels. The proposed studies will aid in identifying
mechanisms involved in PM-induced cardiovascular toxicity, and characterizing promising novel biomarkers of
health effects, with the potential to aid in the design of therapeutic and/or prophylactic interventions against the
toxicity induced by air pollution."
10767355,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Shiftwork is now recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D); yet the mechanisms underlying these
associations are poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap requires converging the fields of metabolism
and chronobiology. T2D pathophysiology is characterized by both impaired metabolic flexibility and circadian
disruption, and skeletal muscle circadian clocks may be at the intersection of these features. Metabolic flexibility
is the capacity to efficiently switch between fuel sources and is largely maintained by skeletal muscle, whereas
metabolic inflexibility is implicated in insulin resistance (IR). Similarly, skeletal muscle clock disruption causes
insulin resistance in pre-clinical models and is associated with impaired glucose tolerance in humans.
Experimental simulations of short-term nightshift induce a prediabetic phenotype, indicating that the circadian
system plays a role in glucose metabolism. Herein, we will test the hypothesis that real-world nightshift work
impairs metabolic flexibility, and that this will be associated with disrupted skeletal muscle clocks. We will
conduct rigorously controlled in-patient studies to assess and compare whole-body metabolic flexibility using
innovative 24h metabolic chamber protocols, as well as diurnal shifts in skeletal muscle clock genes in dayshift
vs. nightshift workers. This NIH K01 Mentored Scientist Career Development Award was designed to enrich the
candidate’s research and training experiences, leading to an independent transdisciplinary research niche that
addresses the public health concerns of T2D risk in shift workers. The candidate will learn classic concepts in
metabolic flexibility and chronobiology from senior-level mentors and gain intensive training and hands-on
experience in cutting-edge methodologies: whole-room metabolic chambers, human skeletal muscle cell culture,
and clinical circadian protocols. The investigative team is uniquely positioned to address links between shiftwork,
metabolic inflexibility, and skeletal muscle clocks. AdventHealth’s Translational Research Institute (sponsoring
institution) houses a clinical research unit prepared for biospecimen collections, 4 state-of-the-art metabolic
chamber suits, and wet lab space dedicated to human skeletal muscle cell culture work. This project is a
collaborative effort with AdventHealth’s Nursing, Whole-Person, and Academic Research Group, who will
support recruitment through directly reaching ~1,500 local nurses working nightshift. These studies will
potentially shift the paradigm by identifying a metabolic defect specific to shiftwork that could be modified by
interventions targeting both insulin resistance and impaired fatty acid oxidation components of metabolic
flexibility across the 24h day-night cycle. At the conclusion of the funding period, the candidate will be well
equipped to pursue R-level funding. It is highly likely that exercise/physical activity interventions to mitigate or
prevent shiftwork-associated metabolic dysfunction will be a major focus in future directions. We fully expect
that this proposal will initiate a long line of productive collaborations among the investigative team, which will
eventually culminate in a significant body of work addressing the chronic metabolic disease burden of shiftwork."
10833567,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Perturbations in metabolic pathways form the epicenter of some of the most devasting threats to mankind,
including cardiovascular disease, obesity and NASH. Proper maintenance of metabolic homeostasis requires
precise and synchronized control of gene regulation. Recently, the discovery that thousands of mammalian
RNAs undergo chemical modifications that powerfully impacts transcript dynamics expands our understanding
of gene regulatory mechanisms. N6-methyladenosine methylation (m6A) is the most common internal RNA
modification. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that m6A plays a critical role in organismal biology, including
stem cell renewal, however, the impact of chemical modifications on RNA in metabolic control is less well
understood. The objective of this proposal is to define the physiologic contribution and mechanisms of RNA
modifications in metabolism. Capitalizing on our preliminary studies showing that the hepatic m6A landscape is
altered in response to diet and strongly enriches lipogenic RNAs, we hypothesize that dynamic RNA
modifications are essential for tight regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. Reinforcing this premise, our studies
show that liver-specific knockout of m6A installing machinery leads to increased lipogenesis and alterations in
hepatic lipid composition. In aim1, we investigate the function of m6A in hepatic lipid metabolism and fatty liver
disease as well as explore opportunities for RNA modification based therapeutic strategies in metabolic
disease. In aim2, we define how m6A modifications impact lipogenesis and decipher the hierarchical and
cooperative relationship between m6A modifying enzymes and canonical metabolic transcriptional modulators.
Our proposed studies are expected to shed fundamental insight into novel mechanisms involved in metabolic
control and a model by which RNA modifications can impact health and disease states. In summary, our
studies identify a new pathway for lipid degradation and in this application, we propose a series of molecular,
cell biological, and animal studies to extend our preliminary observations and test out hypothesis."

 The Multidisciplinary Research Training Program (MRTP) in pulmonary disease provides comprehensive
research training for individuals committed to a career in lung biology and biomedical research. Our main
objective is to provide structured, intensive research and didactic training to pulmonary physicians at the GME
fellowship level and Ph.D. scientists with interests in lung disease. Our primary goal is to foster the development
of trainee skills needed to pursue successful investigative careers. We recognize the importance of
multidisciplinary training and the synergy of interactions among M.D., M.D./Ph.D., D.O. and Ph.D. trainees. We
provide broad access to two training modules, basic or clinical science, bridging a translational continuum. For
those pursuing a predominantly basic science pathway, the key training activity will be mentored time in a basic
research laboratory, supplemented by participation at research conferences and targeted didactic education. For
those choosing a more clinical focus, the key training activity will be mentored time conducting a clinically focused
research project coupled with didactic training focused on gaining clinical study design skills, while ensuring
translational expertise. We appreciate that this basic-translational-clinical continuum is fluid as we focus on
providing participants opportunities to explore the translational relevance of their investigative focus. Drs.
Fernando Martinez and Augustine Choi serve as co-Program Directors, while Drs. Robert Kaner and Heather
Stout-Delgado serve as Associate Program Directors. This group has a long record of investigative and
mentoring collaboration, while refining a robust approach to comprehensive assessment of trainee progress with
a series of overlapping systems that allow a careful tracking of trainees achieving pre-established benchmarks
and timetables. The program leverages a dynamic mentoring team with robust training units comprised of an
outstanding multidisciplinary faculty with active research programs in either lung disease or in disciplines relevant
to lung disease. Our recipe for success remains a simple and focused one: a) identify three post-doctoral trainees
yearly with a demonstrated interest in a research focused career; b) structure a nurturing and productive
environment; c) identify a mentor and/or co-mentor ideally suited to provide training and mentoring; and d)
provide a period of support (up to 3 years) so that training can progress to a point where the emerging investigator
can compete for an entry level award and thrive as an independent investigator."

The primary objective of our training program is to provide a comprehensive educational environment to young
physicians and/or scientists interested in academic translational research in the areas of burns and trauma.
Our training program is an integrated two-year research experience that offers up to three individual trainees,
at the postdoctoral level, highly structured research training in fundamental aspects of molecular biology,
physiology, biochemistry, metabolism, immunology, and cell biology as they pertain to the pathophysiologic
state post burn. The training program includes basic or bench research, animal research, and human or clinical
research studies in which the concepts of interpreting basic information from the laboratory and applying it to
clinical problems and clinical research are taught [bench-to-bedside]. Clinical, translational, and basic science
investigators focus their efforts to address problems pertinent to improving outcomes, survival, and the quality
of life of burned adults and children. The rationale for the faculty to participate in these mentoring activities, is
that we have seen how such experience has advanced burn and trauma care. Research trainees at our
institutions, supported by NIH training grants, such as this T32, have over the last 30 years, significantly
advanced our understanding of injury and treatment. During the past decade, pediatric mortality has decreased
from 32% to 17% for burns over 60% of the total body surface area. This decrease in mortality is due to
advancements in resuscitation, control of the metabolic response to trauma, control of infection, and early total
coverage of burn wounds, progress that is in large part due to our NIH post-doctoral fellows' research efforts.
From their research efforts, we have been able to decrease the length of hospital stay by half, and improve
psychosocial and functional outcomes. As mentors, we continue to direct our trainees' interest to the areas of
cardiopulmonary pathophysiology, responses to thermal injury at the molecular level, substrate metabolism,
immunology, infection, wound healing, scarring, rehabilitation, and the integrated and long-term outcomes of
burned adults and children. These outcomes are studied to determine the effect of interventions such as
clinical therapeutics or exercise/nutrition. Future advancements will be assured by NIH-funded training
programs such as ours."
10805358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires in the United States. By 2011, 25-40% of
all small particulate matter air pollution in the US was attributed to wildfires and the contribution of wildfires to
air quality will likely increase as they proliferate and other anthropogenic sources decline. Wildfire produced air
pollutants are spread across thousands of miles by prevailing winds. Wildfires, and the air pollutants carried by
their smoke plumes, have profound impacts on adult health. However, far less is known about their impacts on
infants, who are particularly sensitive to the adverse exposures associated with wildfire events. Air pollution,
psychosocial stress, and community disruption in the prenatal period and in the first year of life could adversely
impact birthweight, gestational age, hospital service use, and infant mortality. The proposed project will link
high-resolution, state-of-the-art exposure measures, developed from satellite observations, ground monitors,
and numeric modeling with natality, hospital discharge, and mortality records from 2003-2019. Natality and
linked birth-death records cover a near census of births from every US county. Hospital discharge records,
from 15 states, include all discharges from all payers, and have been individually linked to birth and death
records. The three specific aims are to: (1) Measure the extent and sociodemographic, geographic, and
temporal patterns of prenatal and first year of life exposure to smoke-plumes, wildfire produced air pollutants,
and local wildfire events; (2) Estimate the impact of total pregnancy and trimester specific wildfire exposure on
health at birth, health service use, neonatal and infant mortality; and (3) Examine the moderating influence of
socio-demographics and baseline air pollutant exposures. The impact of wildfire exposures on infant health will
be estimated in a fixed effects regression framework that isolates the impact of exposure from confounders
that predispose infants with different health risks to wildfire exposure. Our approach compares wildfire-exposed
infants to wildfire-unexposed infants born in different years, but in the same county and calendar month. Our
analytic framework provides a direct method for testing for the presence of pre-existing trends, a principal
threat to causal inference. Results from our study will be the first national estimates of infant exposure to
wildfires and smoke-plumes, and their impacts on infant health outcomes. Our findings will be critical for
mitigation planning as climate change continues to accelerate wildfire growth in the coming decades."
10709573,"Veterans who have lost an upper extremity in service of country have lost both hand function and the sense
of touch. Losing these primary sources of physical, manipulative, and emotional connection to the world
results in lifelong functional and social deficits. To restore the emotional and functional aspects of the hand to
a veteran, we have developed an implanted system of nerve electrodes to restore touch and sense of movement
and intramuscular electrodes to provide intuitive, long-term, stable control of prostheses with the look and
functions of a human hand. We have successfully deployed these electrode interfaces in four subjects for more
than six years without significant adverse events. Several case-series studies in-lab demonstrate multiple
important aspects of sensory restoration and prosthesis control. A five-week, in-home case series demonstrated
significant advantages to restoring sensation with even a one degree-of-freedom prosthesis. Beyond the
traditional prostheses, the new system has been connected to an advanced, human hand-like hand that has
sensors at nine locations to be used with the sensory feedback to the user and has individual motion of the
index finger, thumb, wrist, and middle through ring finger as a single group.
 The initial trials implemented wires through the skin as connection to the interfaces, but now we have
completed development of a fully-implanted, BluetoothLE™connected system to eliminate these connections.
The next step required to move this new technology towards making the treatment available to veterans is a larger, pilot
randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing an advanced prosthesis treatment with implanted nerve and muscles interfaces
to traditional, state-of-art, clinically-prescribed prosthesis treatment. The implanted system with sensory feedback
and high degree-of-freedom control is expected to improve the subjects’ outcomes over currently-available
options. The results of this pilot trial will establish the viability and importance of the advanced prostheses and
will support a subsequent pivotal trial.
 The study has two aims. Aim 1 will determine the functional outcomes, social outcomes, and usage of an
advanced prostheses with implanted electrodes compared to the subject’s clinically prescribed, state-of-
art prosthesis treatment. Eight subjects will participate in a randomized, 2 x 2 cross-over study comparing
the new human hand-like prosthesis with implanted interfaces to the subject’s commercial prosthesis. Our
primary hypothesis is that within subject differences of the Othortics and Prosthetics User Survey - Quality of
Life (OPUS-QOL) measure will show significant improvement with the advanced prosthesis system. We will
collect weekly surveys for psychosocial outcomes and log device usage when subjects are at home. Subjects
will come to the lab monthly for functional tests and a larger range of surveys to understand the explore the
impact of the prosthesis on the subject’s daily life. Aim 2 will determine if restoration of sensory feedback
alone or multiple degrees-of-freedom alone improves functional outcomes, social outcomes, and usage of
the prosthesis. Following the Aim 1 cross-over study, subjects will continue in a second 2 x 2 cross-over study
comparing sensory feedback with the function of the subject’s commercial prosthesis to no sensory with the
fully functional advanced prosthesis. Our primary hypothesis is that within subject differences of the measures
will show that both sensory feedback and implanted control significantly improve the OPUS-QOL measure
compared to the subject’s clinically prescribed prosthesis treatment, but not as strongly as both together. We
will also collect and analyze the same extensive data set as in Aim 1.
 The proposed research will be the first to deploy a prosthetic treatment with a fully-implanted interface in a
long-term, home-use, randomized clinical trial. This is expected to make a significant leap forward toward making
advanced sensory-enabled, intuitive, high degree-of-freedom prosthetic systems available to improve quality of life and
options for veterans with upper limb loss."
10769723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In addition to signaling/transcription factor-dependent regulatory mechanisms, lineage-specific gene
expression programs in stem cells and their progenies are also regulated epigenetically, i.e., via regulation of
covalent DNA/histone modifications and higher-order chromatin remodeling. Epigenetic regulatory machinery
maintain the progenitor population and epithelial identity in epidermal keratinocytes, as well as inhibit premature
activation of terminal differentiation-associated genes and balance their transcription in differentiating cells.
 Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a large portion (44%-55%) of the entire mouse or human
genomes. Most TEs are transcriptionally inactive under physiological conditions, while their inappropriate
activation has been implicated in pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders and carcinogenesis. In keratinocytes,
UV exposure activates transcription of various endogenous retroviral sequences which are closely related to the
sequences activated in lupus erythematosus patients. Furthermore, increasing evidence of data suggest an
involvement of endogenous TEs in the development of pro-inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis.
 However, there is a number of critical questions that this project seeks to investigate, remain unclear:
1) Which TEs are expressed in normal keratinocytes during skin development, postnatal homeostasis and
terminal differentiation, 2) Which mechanisms regulate TE silencing in keratinocytes, and 3) When TE silencing
is compromised, how are keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal inflammatory response impacted?
 In this Multi-PI proposal, we will address the hypothesis that distinct classes of TEs differentially contribute
to the control of gene expression in epidermal keratinocytes, mediated by epigenetic regulators Lsh and Setdb1
that serve as critical determinants mediating the TE silencing and preventing pro-inflammatory responses in the
epidermis. This hypothesis will be addressed via three Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. Define the landscape of transposable element expression in normal mouse and human
keratinocytes during skin development, postnatal homeostasis and terminal differentiation.
 Aim 2. Define the roles for Lsh and Setdb1 in the control of transposable element silencing in
keratinocytes.
 Aim 3. Define the impact and mechanisms associated with the transposable element activation in
keratinocytes on epidermal inflammatory response.
 The generated outputs from this application will provide novel insights into fundamental mechanisms
underlying keratinocyte differentiation in normal mouse and human skin, as well as will promote the development
of novel paradigms for management of disorders of epidermal differentiation and inflammatory responses in
humans via modulation of TE activities."
10806940,"Endothelial diaphragms are protein barriers associated with vascular endothelial subcellular structures, such
as fenestrae, transendothelial channels (TEC), caveolae and vesiculo-vacuolar organelles implicated in
vascular permeability and immune response. Fenestrae are circular transcellular pores in vascular endothelial
cells playing critical roles in the maintenance of basal permeability. Recent data in humans and mice
demonstrate that fenestrae and their diaphragms play critical roles in the maintenance of normal endothelial
barrier function, blood homeostasis and ultimately survival. Our group demonstrated that Plasmalemma
Vesicle Associated Protein (PLVAP or PV1) is critical for diaphragm assembly, and that absence of PV1 in
mice and humans causes abnormal fenestrae and perinatal lethality due to multiple vascular defects. PV1 is
also critical in the immune response, and therapeutic strategies based on PV1 biology are being developed for
myocardial infarction, immune diseases and cancer. While there is emerging interest in diaphragms and
fenestrae in the clinic, there is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the components and
regulatory pathways governing fenestrae and diaphragm morphogenesis, addressed in this proposal. Critically
for this proposal, PV1 is the only known marker for diaphragms, and we will exploit this property in our
investigation of regulation diaphragm morphogenesis. Based on our preliminary data and literature, our central
hypothesis is that multiple signaling pathways synergize in vascular bed specific manner for diaphragm and
fenestrae formation. Specifically, crosstalk between growth factors and laminin binding integrin receptors are
critical for PV1 expression and fenestrae and diaphragm morphogenesis. This hypothesis is based on our key
new observations including: 1) differential segmental and spatial control of fenestrae in different vascular beds;
2) Gene expression screens for factors involved in PV1 regulation, identified SCF, FGF-5, VEGF-A and
specific laminins signaling via their respective c-KIT, FGFR1, VEGFR2, and ITGB1 receptors as necessary for
PV1 expression in ERK1/2 dependent manner; and 3) the combination of laminin with SCF, FGF-5 and VEGF-
A results in robust PV1 expression and de novo fenestrae formation We will test our hypothesis using a
combination of functionally validated endothelial cell culture systems and genetically engineered animal
models using loss of function, gain of function and reconstitution approaches. Our Aims will define the role and
downstream signaling pathways of newly identified growth factors and laminins and their integrin receptors
regulating PV1 expression and fenestrae morphogenesis. We are uniquely positioned both in terms of key and
necessary expertise to complete this work. These investigations will define regulatory factors and pathways
controlling the assembly for an intricate and physiologically relevant cellular structure, providing valuable
insight that is currently lacking."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American
women. About 10-20% of breast cancers are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has a propensity to
metastasize, recur, and develop resistance to chemotherapy. TNBC is the only subtype of BC for which there is
no targeted therapy. Chemotherapies remain the mainstay of treatment for TNBC, but their clinical efficacy is
often limited by resistance. Immunotherapy is emerging as an exciting new treatment option for TNBC patients.
While TNBC is more likely to respond to immunotherapy, overall response rate is still low. Developing novel and
more effective TNBC therapies is an unmet biomedical need as most of advanced TNBCs do not respond well
to current therapies. Epigenetic alterations such as DNA hypermethylation and histone dysregulation have been
associated with all stages of TNBC formation and progression. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is the first
identified histone demethylase which specifically demethylates H3K4me1/2. LSD1 is a key component of multiple
transcription repressor complexes. Tumors in TNBC patients frequently express higher level of LSD1 compared
to other BC groups. Clinically, LSD1 protein overexpression is significantly associated with worse prognosis in
TNBC patients, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Our recent study has revealed a new mechanism
driving LSD1 protein overexpression in TNBC through HDAC5-mediated posttranslational modification.
Treatment with LSD1 inhibitors effectively suppresses tumor progression and sensitizes TNBC cells to
chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, LSD1 ablation stimulates antitumor immunity and potentiates the
efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody in poorly immunogenic TNBC. LSD1 inhibition leads to reexpression of a key
epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene, Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), which is required for
tumor suppression and responsiveness to immunotherapy. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that LSD1
overexpression facilitates TNBC development and inhibition of LSD1 improves TNBC therapies by inducing
TFPI2-mediated cell killing and antitumor immunity. Aim1. Determine the functional roles of LSD1
overexpression in TNBC development; Aim2. Evaluate the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of LSD1
inhibition against TNBC; Aim3. Elucidate the immunogenic effects of LSD1 inhibition in TNBC. The results from
the proposed studies are expected to provide new mechanistic insights and key preclinical evidence for using
LSD1 inhibitors in TNBC. In the long run, these studies may lead to new and improved therapies for patients
with relapsed and refractory TNBC."

Obesity remains highly prevalent among adolescents and young adults in the United States and
relatively few youth with overweight or obesity are able to lose weight and maintain the loss, thus
making prevention of paramount importance. Although a range of genetic loci and behavioral and
environmental factors predictive of weight change and obesity have been identified in prospective
studies, their associations with weight gain and obesity have been modest in magnitude. Moreover,
the numerous clinical trials aimed at prevention of obesity in children and adolescents have yielded
modest effects. One possible reason for the lack of observing large effects in observational studies or
clinical trials is that all types of overweight and obesity are often grouped together. One potential
consequence of overlooking the heterogeneity in obesity is missing or underestimating risk factors for
specific subtypes of obesity. An alternative strategy is to identify subtypes and examine subtype-
specific associations. More careful phenotyping of obesity could potentially be used to advance the
field of obesity epidemiology and treatment. Research is needed to identify the range of obesity
phenotypes and whether there are differences in obesity subtypes by biological sex and race. We
propose using appetitive behaviors, psychological, behavioral, anthropometric, physiological, genetic,
and familial data, in a person-centered approach to empirically identify subtypes of obesity and to
investigate whether the subtypes vary by biological sex or race. We will use data collected from the
2379 girls in National Growth and Health Study, 1421 children (48% with obesity and 17% with
overweight) studied in the Section on Growth and Obesity at the Eunice Shriver Kennedy National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the 16,850 youth in the Growing Up
Today Study (14.9% with obesity and 29% with overweight). We will use latent class analysis to
identify subgroups of obesity and then examine whether the empirically-derived phenotypes are
predictive of weight change in adolescence and young adulthood, the development of hypertension
before age 35, or have a differential pattern of association with the obesity loci. In addition, we will
examine whether the phenotypes vary by biological sex or race and whether the associations of
phenotypes with weight change in adolescence and young adulthood and the development of
hypertension before age 35, vary by biological sex or race. The results of our proposed study could
have a major impact on the field. The first step towards decreasing disparities by race and sex is to
examine if there are differences in presentation and course of a disorder. Our study will provide that
much needed information, which could result in tailored and more effective prevention and treatments."

Periodontitis, which results in irreversible damage in hard and soft tooth-supporting tissues, affects 42% US
adults. This extremely prevalent inflammatory oral disease is also tightly associated with systemic diseases
such as diabetes. Clinical studies have shown that periodontitis contains mixed disease phenotypes. For
example, the disease progression pattern in about 20% of periodontitis patients is clearly distinct from that of
the majority in a population. Recently, we used a data-driven approach to create a periodontal profile
classification (PPC)-Staging system by integrating periodontal measurements and indices from a closely
followed up community cohort. After validation, we demonstrated that this new PPC-Staging tool has drastically
improved clinical associations with several systemic diseases including diabetes, stroke, and coronary heart
disease due to the improved homogeneity of each PPC-Stage (I to VII). Through a proteomic biomarker
analysis in the gingival crevicular fluid of a patient pool from the cohort, we found that the expression pattern of
the interferon-β (IFN-β) cytokine, a classical member of type I interferon (IFN-I), in PPC-Stages mimics that of
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), a well-described classical anti-inflammatory cytokine. This novel
finding prompted us to evaluate the role of IFN-I in periodontitis. Using a mouse periodontitis model, we found
that IFN-I plays a protective role in alveolar bone loss. We further found that such a protective role of IFN-I is
associated with a dampening of an interleukin (IL)-17-neutropphil axis, while the transcription of Il27 in local
gingiva was upregulated. The role of IL-27 in an integral IFN-I pathway has yet remained to be elucidated in
periodontitis. We further showed that IFN-β signaling suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced
proinflammatory cytokine production in and potently inhibited osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow-
derived monocytes. We therefore hypothesize that an integral IFN-I response in monocytic lineage plays a
protective role in periodontitis by deactivating an IL-17-neurophil axis through an IL-27 pathway. We seek to
gain insight into the mechanism of IFN-I in modulating innate and adaptive immune responses in periodontal
disease. We propose to test this central hypothesis by the following approaches: 1) we will first define the role
of Type I IFN- IL-27 pathway in IL-17-neutrophil axis using the animal periodontitis model; 2) we will then
assess the specific role of IFN-I signaling in myeloid lineage that contains monocytic /osteoclast precursor cells
in the periodontitis model; 3) we will also evaluate the effect of a locally delivered novel nanoparticle-mediated
sustained release of IFN-β/IFN-I stimulator in the periodontitis model. Our goal of this project is to advance the
understanding of INF-I, a clinically relevant yet under-investigated molecule, in periodontal disease, and to
leverage IFN-β or IFN-I-centered inflammatory networks as biomarkers to further refine the clinical periodontal
disease classification. In addition, this research proposal will provide evidence to target IFN-Is as an adjunctive
therapeutic measure in a subset of patients to improve precision periodontal health."
10829272,"The health disparity in preterm birth (PTB) that exists in the United States (US) is a national crisis. Pregnant
Black women have a 50% higher risk of PTB compared to pregnant White women in the US, and their
infants are more than twice as likely to die. This disparity continues despite decades of research and tried
intervention. Over ten years ago, the National Academy of Medicine identified Black women’s exposure to
chronic stress as among the most important risk factors contributing to this health disparity and called for
additional research as necessary. Although additional research has been conducted, the high rates of PTB
among Black women have continued unabated. Thus, to address this significant critical need, we have
brought together an exemplary team of researchers and clinicians with unique and complementary expertise.
With this team, we will conduct a first of its kind clinic trial: testing the efficacy of a 10-week, live, culturally
congruent music intervention compared to a similarly delivered 10-week sham control, to reduce the
biological impact of chronic stress at the most fundamental level -- the molecules and metabolic pathways
that are affected by stress. We further propose implementing the Music Characterization System (MCS) to
identify the musical mechanisms underlying any benefit. Black women in the US often are exposed to
chronic stress related to their race, sex, socioeconomic status, and social determinants of health including
neighborhood and household food insecurity. Our study stems from our team’s previous research
demonstrating that within a similar population of pregnant Black women, chronic stress was associated with
changes in maternal metabolites and metabolic pathways linked to oxidative stress, energy production, and
myelination, all potentially influencing pregnancy and newborn outcomes. This study also stems from our
team’s rigorous research showing the power of live music to reduce stress and improve outcomes. Based on
the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, we will recruit 142
pregnant Black women during their 1st trimester of pregnancy and implement the Music Intervention or sham
control beginning in the 2nd trimester. Women will collect saliva samples for later metabolomic analysis and
complete surveys at the 1st, 5th, and 10th-week verbal or sham session. Birth outcomes will be determined
from careful review of the labor and delivery record. Music is one of the earliest, most traditional art forms in
human history, while metabolomics is one of the newest and most advanced technologies available in the
world today. By combining the very old with the very new in this innovative study, we have the opportunity to
identify a means by which the beneficial effects of live, culturally relevant music chosen by a pregnant
woman and implemented therapeutically, can reduce the biological impact of the daily stressors to which she
is exposed, and as a result, reduce one of the most persistent health disparities of our time, PTB."
10753508,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in the Western world despite significant
advances in early detection and extensive use of lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive drugs. To date, no single
drug has been developed to target the primary disease process in the vessel wall. A complete understanding
of the disease susceptibility is urgently needed to develop additional therapies. Common forms of
atherosclerosis involve environmental factors, hundreds of genetic variations, and their interactions, each of
which exert a relatively small effect on disease susceptibility. The most recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS) in nearly six hundred fifty thousand individuals identified 175 independent variants associated with
increased risk for CAD. However, most of the underlying genes and the related mechanisms of how these
variants contribute to the disease process remain unknown. This proposal outlines an integrative genetics
study in a unique resource of human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from 151 genotyped multi-
ethnic heart transplant donors to discover the CAD-associated variants that perturb SMC gene expression and
their downstream functional consequences. In recent studies, we measured gene expression in quiescent and
proliferative culture conditions representing the transdifferentiation of SMCs from a healthy to an atherogenic
phenotype. We identified 84 genes whose expression was associated with CAD variants in GWAS loci.
However, the causal genetic variants in these loci remain to be elucidated. Therefore, as part of the proposed
studies, we will first perform massively parallel reporter assays to identify the variants that modulate gene
expression in SMCs. We will also take advantage of the natural variation in gene expression to construct co-
expression and Bayesian networks to understand how the predicted candidate causal genes function in SMCs.
We will refine these networks by mapping regulatory elements to nascent RNA transcripts in response to pro-
inflammatory cytokines. We will then validate our predictions in gain and loss-of-function experiments in
cultured SMCs. We will also validate our predictions in well-phenotyped coronary artery specimens from cases
of unexpected sudden death by performing immunohistochemical analysis of proteins encoded by genes that
are predicted to play a key role in atherosclerosis-relevant SMC phenotypes. The overall goal of the proposed
studies is to integrate systems genetics and computational biology leading to mechanistic predictions of the
gene networks that are perturbed by CAD. Besides understanding CAD loci, these integrative genetics studies
will provide a useful window into the flow of biological information from genetic variants to SMC gene
expression and atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes."
10818329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exercise slows the cognitive declines associated with aging and protects against the development and
progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). At the cellular level, exercise
enhances synaptic connectivity and reduces markers of neuroinflammation in aging cortical circuits. Exactly how
exercise signals in the brain generate these neuroprotective effects remains unknown. Our preliminary
experiments have identified a set of neurons in the mouse ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) expressing
Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) that robustly increase their activity in response to exercise. We have found that
the VMH SF-1 neural activity signal is potentiated severalfold following repeated exercise, suggesting that the
exercise signals generated by VMH SF-1 neurons are plastic and shaped by experience. Furthermore, we have
found that direct stimulation of SF-1 neurons substantially increases subsequent endurance capacity, suggesting
VMH Sf-1 neurons are an important neural node controlling the physiological benefits of exercise. However,
several important questions remain unknown. First, which features of VMH SF-1 neurons enables plasticity of
activity signals following repeated exercise? Second, which specific sets of VMH SF-1 output neurons transmit
exercise-relevant signals? Last, is it possible to stimulate VMH SF-1 neurons and generate the neuroprotective
effects of exercise on cognition and neural circuitry in the aging brain or in AD-like states? The proposed
experiments will leverage advanced neuroanatomical and neurophysiological tools with preclinical genetic
models to gain insights into these questions. In Aim 1, we will pair large-volume, high-resolution, and cell-type
specific array tomographic neuroanatomical reconstructions with in vivo calcium imaging and neuronal activity
perturbations to determine how exercise shapes the synaptic architecture of VMH SF-1 neurons. These
experiments will define how changes in the synaptic inputs to these neurons might physically `store' exercise
history within VMH circuitry. In Aim 2, we will use advanced viral mapping and in vivo single-cell functional
imaging techniques to identify which neurons are activated by exercise and understand how these exercise
signals are transmitted to specific circuits downstream of the VMH. These experiments will define the
organization and logic by which exercise-related activity in VMH neurons drives functional changes in the brain.
In Aim 3, we will take advantage of advanced preclinical genetic mouse models of early- and late-onset AD to
determine whether stimulating activity in VMH neurons might recapitulate the neuroprotective effects of exercise
observed in cortical circuits. These experiments will increase our understanding of how signals in the VMH could
be harnessed for therapeutic manipulation in disease states. By leveraging the synergistic expertise of the team
of investigators assembled to address this problem, insights from these experiments will advance our
fundamental understanding of how the beneficial effects of exercise are mediated by specific synapses, cell-
types, and circuits, and whether these features are potential therapeutic targets for intervention in disease states."

Immunotherapy has shown limited efficacy against pediatric sarcoma. In our recently completed phase I study,
infusion of HER2-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) was safe and showed encouraging
indicators of antitumor activity, including three durable complete responses. The key observations from this study
are: (1) lymphodepletion promotes CAR-T expansion but only marginally improves persistence, (2) adoptively
transferred CAR-T are susceptible to immune inhibition, and (3) antigen downregulation/loss is associated with
disease relapse. While the literature is lacking on immune inhibitory mechanisms and tumor adaptations in
sarcoma, our findings are in line with observations made by others in early clinical and pre-clinical studies of
cellular therapy for solid tumors. Our long-term goal is to develop new approaches that capitalize on expected
tumor defenses which may be key to unleashing the potential of CAR-T against sarcomas and other solid tumors.
Therapeutic approaches that integrate strategies to address these compensatory mechanisms up front may
mitigate downstream tumor escape and relapse. The objective of this project is to conduct prospective clinical
testing of HER2 CAR-T in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint disruption strategies in a disease-specific
cohort. The central hypothesis is that the combination immunotherapy will promote immune infiltration, remodel
the tumor microenvironment, alleviate CAR-T dysfunction, and thereby improve antitumor responses. Our
specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) The combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and HER2 CAR-
T administered after lymphodepletion is safe in patients with sarcoma, will improve CAR-T kinetics, and will elicit
antitumor responses; (Aim 2) Cellular and serum-based studies in treated patients will help identify biomarkers
of toxicity and response; and (Aim 3) Engineering CAR-T to positively transform the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in
the tumor microenvironment will potentiate antitumor effects of the cellular product while incorporating design
attributes to enhance its safety . We will evaluate Aims 1 and 2 through implementation of a phase I study of
autologous HER2 CAR-T and anti-PD-1 antibody after cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion in
patients with sarcoma (HEROS 3.0 clinical trial). In Aim 3, we will develop an investigational new drug (IND) for
HER2 CAR-T co-expressing a PD-1 checkpoint reversal receptor (CPR). At the conclusion of the project, we will
understand if CAR-T can be safely administered with immune checkpoint inhibition to improve treatment
outcomes for children and young adults with sarcoma. The significance of these contributions are: (1)
establishing the clinical utility of combination immunotherapy for sarcoma, (2) potentially identifying “modifiable”
patient- and treatment-related factors to guide future improvements to CAR-T therapy, and (3) enabling clinical
testing of an innovative CAR-T platform. This knowledge is critical to advancing the field, as recurrent or
refractory sarcomas remain largely incurable."

Genetically modified mouse models of breast cancer have been used for decades as premier basic
science tools for mechanistic discovery. However, the successful implementation of mouse models as
surrogates of therapeutic efficacy and translational research has been challenging. One major challenge
for status quo approaches is their limited ability to model the genetic heterogeneity observed in breast
cancers. Metastatic and treatment resistant HER2+ breast cancers are incurable largely due to this
heterogeneity, the source of which may stem from the competition and evolution of multiple oncogenic
isoforms of the driver gene HER2. The objective for this proposal is to recapitulate the genetic
heterogeneity of HER2 oncogenes in a genetically tractable model more closely resembling the human
condition – including an intact immune system and stromal network. Published preliminary data
recently described a Cancer rainbow (Crainbow) modeling system for fluorescently barcoding and
expressing multiple tumor driver genes in a single immune intact mouse. The fluorescent barcode is
retrieved by multispectral imaging and single-cell “omics” techniques providing a simple solution for
inducing intratumor heterogeneity and visualizing its evolution. Any tumor driver gene can be
incorporated into Crainbow mice. Therefore, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that
modeling the oncogenic heterogeneity of HER2 in a Cancer rainbow mouse
recapitulates the phenotypic heterogeneity found in treatment resistant and metastatic
HER2+ breast cancers. The central hypothesis will be tested by completing four specific aims
seeking to: (Aim 1) Validate a HER2 Crainbow mouse model of tumor heterogeneity, (Aim 2)
Demonstrate heterogeneity within the tumor epithelium, (Aim 3) Demonstrate heterogeneity of the
tumor microenvironment and its contribution to tumor biology, and (Aim 4) Demonstrate
heterogeneity and differential response to therapy. HER2 Crainbow mice will provide an autochthonous
mouse model of the genetic heterogeneity found in HER2+ breast cancer, all while maintaining the
endogenous contributions of the tumor microenvironment to invasion and metastasis. Completing this
proposal is expected to validate the HER2 Crainbow mouse as a shareable resource strain for more
predictive preclinical trials and a framework for illuminating the molecular and cellular ontogeny of
invasive breast cancer."

 Drugs that inhibit Bcl2-family survival proteins promise to change the landscape of cancer care. Cancers
activate stress signals in the form of BH3-domain proteins like Bim as they escape cellular growth constraints
and invade hostile environments. To remain viable, tumors use survival proteins like Bcl2, Bclx, Bclw and Mcl1
to sequester these BH3 proteins through specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This blocks their apoptotic
signal but also renders such tumors continually dependent on this function. Drugs that competitively displace
BH3 proteins from the survival protein sequestering them unleash a potent apoptotic signal. Indeed, venetoclax
is a Bcl2 inhibitor that has demonstrated striking clinical efficacy, garnering FDA-approval for the treatment of
chronic lymphocytic and adult myelogenous leukemias.These tumor types do not have Bcl2-activatingmutations
but are empirically defined to be dependent on Bcl2 for their survival. In contrast, many solid tumors have
heterogeneity in which survival protein they use to block BH3 signals, and the absence of biomarkers that predict
sensitivity to this emerging drug class remains a barrier. Our objectives are to identify predictive biomarkers and
develop diagnostic tools to leverage Bcl2-family inhibitors for clinical use. We created a national infrastructure to
generate patient-derivedxenograftand cell line models of the lethal childhood tumor, neuroblastoma, and utilized
innovative functional assays to define the Bcl2-family protein they depend on for survival. We discovered that
neuroblastomas have endogenously activated Bim neutralized through a PPI with a single dominant survival
protein. This sequesters Bim's apoptotic activity, but also encodes a continual dependency, and defines a
mechanistic biomarker defining the survival protein required for viability. An unanticipated finding is that this
survival dependency is highly cancer cell intrinsic and stable: consistent in patient-matched tumors from primary
and metastatic sites, and at diagnosis and relapse. In tumors with Bim bound by Bcl2 (Bim:Bcl2 PPI), Bcl2
inhibitors like venetoclax are highly active in vitro and in vivo. In tumors with Bim bound by Mcl1 (Bim:Mcl1 PPI),
Bcl2 inhibitors have no activity. Further, we find that all neuroblastomas with MAPK pathway mutations are in
the Bim:Mcl1 class. Surprisingly, Mcl1 inhibitors also have no activity for this subset, despite displacing Bim from
Mcl1. In these tumors, Bim is re-sequestered by Bclx, and all are exquisitely sensitive to combined Mcl1/Bclx
inhibition. This demonstrates the robustness of our predictive Bim PPI biomarker that we will exploit to identify
all survival dependency classes in neuroblastoma. We will define the extent to which the biomarker remains a
stable intrinsic tumor feature that predicts selective vulnerability to Bcl2-family inhibitors. We also leverage
therapeutic MAPK inhibitors to antagonize Mcl1 dependency. Importantly, we seek to develop in vitro diagnostic
tools to identify predictive BimPPIs using proximity-ligation assays, and to credential genomic MAPK biomarkers
to define Mcl1 dependence. Collectively, our work applies precision medicine approaches to assign Bcl2-family
inhibitors for clinical use, and inform clinical trial designs, including predicting rational combination therapies."
10772985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the deadliest and 2nd most common subtype of breast cancer in the
United States. Although promising new drugs based on PARP inhibition and immunotherapy can extend survival
in selected patients, 1 in 3 patients die from TNBC. Increasing evidence suggests that human breast tumors
harbor immature cancer cells which are a distinct subset of tumorigenic cancer cells, are less-differentiated,
capable of replenishing cancer cell populations indefinitely, and strongly implicated in drug resistance.
Unfortunately, existing marker genes for studying these cells are not specific, precluding rational drug
development. We hypothesize that precise identification of immature cancer cells could present new
therapeutic opportunities to revolutionize TNBC treatment. We recently showed that the number of
expressed genes per cell is a powerful surrogate of cellular differentiation status independently of known
marker genes. We leveraged this finding to develop CytoTRACE, a new framework for predicting cellular
differentiation status from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Our published data show that immature
cancer cells predicted by CytoTRACE preferentially express genes essential for tumorigenicity in TNBC. In pilot
data, we identified 10 putative cancer cell populations, including at least 3 immature ones, from scRNA-seq data
of 19 primary breast tumors. Here, we propose to study over 800 TNBC patients to determine whether immature
cancer cells represent at least 3 distinct populations (Aim 1); differ by key clinical covariates (Aim 2); and are
clonogenic and produce specific progeny populations predicted in silico (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, we
will leverage new analytical methods, including a deconvolution approach for integrating scRNA-seq with bulk
tumor transcriptomic data in order to characterize cellular heterogeneity at scale. Successful completion of the
proposed project will validate and refine our pilot data toward advancing our understanding of cancer cell
populations, especially immature cells, in TNBC. As such, we expect this study to facilitate new opportunities for
the development of targeted drugs to improve TNBC outcomes."
10756985,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 5.3 million
people in the US, and projected to reach 13.9 million by 2026. Progress in the management and treatment of
AD is limited by lack of early diagnostics, which are critical to the development of effective therapies. AD is
currently described in three stages; the preclinical, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s
dementia. The difficulty lies in detecting the disease during the preclinical phase, when patients show no
clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment but there is underlying pathology. Currently, we are limited to
detecting the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain using expensive and invasive methods such as
Positron Emission Tomography and cerebrospinal fluid assessment via lumbar puncture. The goal of this
proposal is to develop a novel, non-invasive, and cost-effective retinal vascular biomarker for early AD risk
detection and disease monitoring. There is increasing evidence that there are retinal manifestations of AD; the
neurodegeneration in the brain of AD patients has been shown to be associated with reduced retinal nerve
fiber layer (RNFL) and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer thickness. Thus, the human retina is an easy to
examine part of the brain providing an opportunity to study and to possibly detect AD early. There is
breakdown of the inner retinal blood barrier, pericyte loss, and capillary non-perfusion or dropout in AD. We
have previously characterized metrics of retinal tissue oxygenation in the form of periarteriole and perivenule
capillary free zones (peripheral CFZs). Building on these prior results, our central hypothesis is that the CFZ
will be enlarged in older cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants at high risk for AD, MCI, and mild AD
patients, and this will be associated with reduced RNFL and RGC layer thickness, reduced field of vision, and
reduced sensitivity to contrast. We will test our central hypothesis by completing the following aims: AIM 1:
Quantify and evaluate differences in the peripheral CFZ, structural, and functional measures between
low-risk CU older adults, high-risk CU older adults, MCI, and mild AD groups. We will collect high quality
optical coherence tomography angiography images, structural, and functional measures in the 4 groups with
data from the low-risk CU participants serving as baseline or control data. We will compare the CFZ, structural,
and functional measures in the 4 groups of participants using analysis of covariance. AIM 2: Identify
associations between the peripheral CFZ, structural, and functional measures in high-risk CU, MCI, and
mild AD groups. We will use multiple linear regression models to test the associations of the CFZ versus
structural and functional parameters. Outputs from this proposal will identify whether CFZ measures can be
used as a potential retinal biomarker of early AD risk detection and disease monitoring. Results from our
studies will advance both the NIA’s goal of understanding the nature of biomedical changes associated with
AD and the goal of the National Alzheimer’s Plan to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025."
10764909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While wound healing processes are vital for successful organismal tissue repair, failure to turn off these
mechanisms lead to the excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the development of
fibrosis. Although recent research is beginning to illuminate the circumstances that allow for fibrosis resolution,
most fibrotic conditions remain unresolved; resulting in organ failure or a predisposition to cancer. While the
triggers for fibrotic diseases fall within a handful of categories, including viral/bacterial infection, tissue damage,
and chemical insults, all induce the sustained activation of mesenchymal cells into myofibroblasts. Besides
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which is a major activator of fibroblasts, the ECM also has the ability to
alter a fibroblast’s activation state. We and others have demonstrated that this activated phenotype can persist
despite the cell’s removal from fibrotic tissues, suggesting that fibroblasts have an “epigenetic memory” acquired
during activation and retained thereafter. However, the molecular details underlying epigenetic regulation during
myofibroblastic activation and whether these details are universal despite the activation trigger is unknown.
 One potential mechanism of myofibroblast regulation is through the ECM-dependent expression of pro-
fibrotic genes. Gene expression is a tightly regulated process that requires chromatin remodeling, binding of
transcriptional activators, and recruitment of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. As such, the structural
reorganization of the chromatin plays a large role in the temporal regulation and tissue specificity of gene
expression. Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) is a central catalytic ATP-subunit of the BAF (BRG1/BRM1-
associated factor) complex which works to drive chromatin accessibility via nucleosome eviction. BRG1 has also
been shown to regulate ECM gene expression in both healthy and virally-induced fibrotic contexts. Moreover,
preliminary data found that BRG1-deficient pancreatic fibroblasts lost the expression of a key functional
regulator, Netrin G1. Taken together, this suggests a role of BRG1 in regulating myofibroblast pro-fibrotic genes.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the ECM and fibrosis-inducing viruses alter
fibroblasts’ chromatin landscape in a BRG1-dependent manner and contribute to the epigenetic memory that
underlies myofibroblastic function.
 To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will first investigate BRG1’s involvement in pancreatic fibroblast activation in
vitro and whether this is regulated by ECM-mediated signaling. In Aim 2, experiments will focus on the role of
BRG1 in regulating disease formation by using an in vivo pancreatitis mouse model. Finally, Aim 3 will build on
these lessons and investigate the mechanisms by which fibrosis-inducing viruses cause myofibroblast activation,
beginning with the frequent human pathogen, Influenza A virus. By using a novel perspective to understanding
fibrosis, this research provides insights that will advance cell biology, epigenetics, and virology, as well as reveal
how the ECM/viruses create a pro-fibrotic state."

10758271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Currently available pharmacological therapies for hematologic malignancies, including multiple
myeloma (MM) and myeloid leukemias often fail, despite ongoing treatment, to eradicate all malignant cells,
resulting in establishment of treatment-persistent residual disease TPRD (often referred to as “minimal” residual
disease, MRD), which serves as a reservoir for eventual patient relapses. Despite the critical role of TPRD/MRD
tumor cells as a barrier to cure, their biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities, including immune responsiveness,
has remained understudied. Preliminary data: Our recent studies and preliminary data indicate that treatment-
persistent cancer cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MM, and solid tumors persist through cytotoxic drug
treatments via a non-genetic (and reversible upon drug withdrawal) low-Myc tumor cell state with transcriptional
changes resembling embryonic diapause, a stress-induced dormant stage of suspended development in many
species. In parallel to these studies, our collaborating labs characterized, through CRISPR and pooled pheno-
typic studies, the molecular determinants of response vs. resistance of treatment-naïve solid tumor or blood
cancer cells to natural killer (NK) cells; and how NK cell-induced adaptive transcriptional changes in tumor cells
may contribute to their persistence against NK cells. These studies identified several previously underappreci-
ated regulators of NK cell responses in chemo-naïve tumor cells; and observed that molecular signatures of
clinical resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors overlap with signatures of NK cell response in treatment-
naïve tumor cells, suggesting orthogonal mechanisms regulating NK vs. cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. No-
tably, TPRD/MRD tumor cells with embryonic diapause-like (EDL) chemopersistence exhibit complex and het-
erogeneous dysregulation of transcripts associated with NK cell resistance in treatment-naïve tumor cells. We
hypothesize that cytotoxic drug-persistent residual MM or leukemic cells may often exhibit, compared
to treatment-naïve cells, distinct patterns of responses to the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, as well as
both shared and distinct mechanisms regulating those responses. Approach: Building on our experience
with studies on NK cell resistance of treatment-naïve tumor cells and with experimental models of residual dis-
ease, we will (1) identify genomic factors that define responsiveness vs. resistance to NK cells using
myeloma and myeloid leukemia cells persistent to cytotoxic pharmacological therapies. We will also (2)
define adaptive molecular changes induced during TPRD tumor cell - NK cell interactions and charac-
terize their functional impact. Novelty-Impact: By focusing on the understudied biology of TPRD/MRD, this
project will provide new insights on how to develop individualized NK cell-based therapies for MM or AML with
persistence to cytotoxic drugs."

years. It is unknown whether cognitive assessment instruments measure cognitive health with equal precision and
validity across Latinx and non-Latinx white (NLW) older adults, which is a critical barrier to the accurate detection of
AD/ADRD, its determinants, and its impact. This study will use a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the validity and
equivalence of measures of cognitive and functional decline in Latinx and NLW older adults, using the Harmonized
Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) cognitive test battery (HCAP-R) and informant ratings of cognitive and functional
decline (HCAP-I). Specific Aim 1 will examine the extent to which the HCAP-R and HCAP-I exhibit statistical evidence of
measurement bias across years of education, assessment language (English/Spanish), and ethnicity (Latinx/NLW), using a
series of psychometric analyses. Data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)-HCAP study will be combined with
data from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC)-Cognitive study for this analysis. Specific Aim 2 will
utilize longitudinal data from the BASIC-Cognitive study to examine whether the HCAP-R is equally predictive of
longitudinal trajectories of informant-rated cognitive and functional decline (HCAP-I) between Latinx and NLW older

with varying levels of education and Spanish language use. These data will provide a novel integration of mixed methods
(psychometric, longitudinal prediction of cognitive and functional decline, and qualitative) to inform the equivalence and
validity of the HCAP across culturally, linguistically, and educationally diverse older adults. This K23 program will provide
PI Dr. Briceño with training to develop expertise in psychometric and longitudinal data analysis, qualitative research,
population-based cognitive aging and health disparities research, and research leadership. Training will occur through
individual mentoring, formal workshops and seminars, and international conferences. The K23 mentors are international
leaders in Latinx brain health equity, psychometrics, population-based cognitive aging, and cross-cultural
neuropsychological assessment of AD/ADRD. The K23 will provide Dr. Briceño with expertise and preliminary data to
submit an R01 and to become an independent researcher in cognitive health disparities in AD/ADRD. The University of
Michigan provides an ideal environment to conduct the proposed research and career development, with abundant

10784711,"ABSTRACT
In the United States, half a million adolescents suffer from an eating disorder. With only 66 certified providers
nationally, Family-Based Treatment (FBT), a first-line evidence-based treatment for adolescent eating
disorders, is not readily available to most families. This provider shortage leaves most young patients without
care and undoubtedly contributes to the chronicity and lethality of these conditions. Patients with eating
disorders generally make their first contact with the healthcare system in primary care. As such, equipping
primary care providers (PCPs) with effective means to treat these patients has potential to democratize care,
improve rates of early intervention, and enhance patient outcomes. Family-Based Treatment for Primary Care
(FBT-PC) is a novel intervention for delivery by a PCP in primary care that uses FBT strategies. Data support
proof-of-concept for this adaptation. We have several study aims. (1) We will finalize the FB-PC intervention
through an open case series. (2) We will establish the feasibility and acceptability of FBT-PC for caregivers,
patients, and PCPs in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Finally, (3) we will test preliminary target engagement
of FBT-PC and determine whether it is associated with improved caregiver self-efficacy and, through this
mechanism, symptom remission. Remission will be defined as weight restoration to 95% of expected body
weight and a score within 1 SD of community norms on the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. We
also propose (4) an exploratory aim to evaluate baseline characteristics of our sample to determine for whom
the FBT-PC intervention is most beneficial. To accomplish all aims we will complete an open case series (n =
6), followed by a pilot trial in which we will randomly assign 40 patients (ages 7-18 years) with restrictive eating
disorders and their caregiver(s) to FBT-PC or a control condition of standard FBT. Families will attend up to 18
sessions over 6 months. Goals from the open case series (Aim 1) will include the development of tools for
FBT-PC training and implementation, including treatment and training protocols and fidelity measures.
Feasibility (Aim 2) will be assessed through an evaluation of recruitment and retention. Acceptability (Aim 2)
will be evaluated using mixed methods surveys and interviews of caregivers, patients and PCPs on the topics
of tolerability, fit, and burden. We will also assess the degree to which FBT-PC engages our proposed
mechanism of change, caregiver self-efficacy, to facilitate symptom remission (Aim 3). Effect sizes will be
calculated for FBT-PC with a goal of ≥ 0.5, comparable with those found in FBT trials. Finally, baseline sample
characteristics (Exploratory Aim) will be assessed including caregiver perceptions about their child’s illness,
referral method, length of illness, and symptom severity. Once we have established feasibility, acceptability,
and target engagement of the FBT-PC intervention, we intend to use these findings in support of a large
pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate the noninferiority of effectiveness of FBT-PC versus standard FBT."
10794363,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases are frequently complicated by diseases of the skin. It is not understood why
disease of the surface epithelial tissues of the skin influences the severity of disease of the very different
barrier epithelia in the gut. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that the “inflammatory cross” talk
between skin and the intestine is a consequence of release of hyaluronic acid (HA) from the extracellular
matrix of the skin that then promotes reactive adipogenesis of the intestinal submucosa. Reactive
adipogenesis is a newly recognized innate immune response in both skin and intestine, and important for
antimicrobial defense. Our preliminary data will show that skin injury, or targeted expression of hyaluronidase
in the skin, has a major affect on the intestinal stroma, resulting in alterations in gut inflammation and the fecal
microbiome. The mechanism we propose to explain how this occurs centers around our discovery that HA is
key for the capacity of submucosal intestinal fibroblasts to differentiate into adipocytes. Fragments of HA
generated in the skin circulate to the gut to stimulate adipogenesis and induce transcriptional changes in
preadipocytes. The stromal cells undergoing differentiation into adipocytes and then release antimicrobial
peptides and adipokines that alter the immune status of the intestine. Thus, our central hypothesis is that injury
to the skin modulates host defense in the intestine by the capacity of HA fragments to stimulate adipocyte
differentiation. This proposal will test this hypothesis, carefully define the influence of adipogenesis on local
host defense and define the mechanisms responsible for these observations. This data can be critical toward
developing new and innovative treatments for intestinal inflammation."

 Genetics is a critical factor underlying human disease, wellness, and lifespan. Genetic research has led
to enormous improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a great range of diseases. The long-
term objective of the proposed program is to strengthen the national scientific workforce to improve human
health. We have designed the Training Program in Genetics (TPG) to provide unified training in modern
genetics research for predoctoral students across three campuses and from three main departments at Yale
University. It aims to prepare PhD students for leadership positions in science and science-related careers via
five key objectives: i) to provide training in rigorous experimental design, new technology and quantitative
methods; ii) to build intellectual community among geneticists addressing a wide variety of problems and
across several departments; iii) to develop communication skills by providing opportunities to present research
and by providing feedback on the presentations; iv) to foster an environment that promotes diversity, equity,
and inclusion; v) to develop leadership skills that are applicable not only in genetics research but also in a
variety of other science and science-related careers. We will advocate for these innovations to be adopted by
other training programs and therefore impact the larger university community. Students develop skills via a
combination of coursework, laboratory research, and a rich variety of carefully designed program-specific
activities. The TPG will hold monthly Research in Progress talks, an annual Retreat, an annual Symposium,
workshops on R statistics and other topics, and opportunities to discuss topics in genetics with undergraduates
in a course for non-science majors. A number of career development opportunities will be provided. The TPG
is distinguished from other training programs at Yale by the remarkable wealth of interests of its trainers.
Faculty trainers are united by a common focus on genetics but address wide-ranging problems at different
levels in diverse species, providing exceptionally rich training. Junior trainers are mentored by senior trainers,
and all take a common evidence-based course on mentoring. Students and trainers are selected via a set of
criteria, including the diversity of background and experience that they bring to the program, as well as their
commitment to mentoring and supporting student education. The program will be overseen by two Directors
with complementary expertise, an internal Executive Committee, and an external Advisory Committee.
Success of the TPG will be evaluated regularly according to a detailed plan designed and executed by a
professional with expertise in program assessment. The program would welcome seven new students each
year and provide stipend and tuition support during years 2 and 3 for 14 slots total per year, with a cohort of ~
42 students across ~ six years of training."

This proposal is a request for continued funding of the NIH-sponsored Clinical Pharmacology T32
Fellowship Training Program at the Mayo Clinic. The foundation for this long-running program is strong
training in state-of-the-art biomedical research as applied to human-drug interactions, i.e., Clinical
Pharmacology. The Mayo Clinical Pharmacology training experience includes a curriculum that exposes
Trainees to the rapidly evolving science that underlies Clinical Pharmacology. However, beyond a strong
curriculum that includes pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism and pharmacogenomics, at the heart of
the Program are outstanding individual research experiences within a supportive mentoring
environment. Clinical Pharmacology lies at the confluence of molecular pharmacology, multiple
“omics” and, increasingly, exciting analytical techniques such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning—techniques that this center has embraced and applied to studies of drug mechanisms and
drug response. The union of these analytical techniques with the leadership that the Mayo Clinic Program has
demonstrated over the years in the application of “multiple omics” to Clinical Pharmacology will help move us
closer to the twin goals of truly “individualized” and “rational” drug therapy. We propose to take advantage of
the opportunity represented by the dramatic advances occurring in biomedical and computational
science to train the next generation of Clinical Pharmacologists by joining the latest laboratory-based
pharmacologic science with modern computational techniques to enhance mechanistic understanding
and the predictability of drug response. Comprehensive, highly integrated academic medical centers like
the Mayo Clinic are ideally positioned to address this challenge. The Mayo Clinic has a history of performing
and integrating outstanding basic and clinical medical research as well as a tradition of continuing contributions
to the discipline of Clinical Pharmacology and decades of experience in recruiting and training both physician
scientists and laboratory-based translational scientists in Clinical Pharmacology. During the next funding cycle,
the Mayo Clinical Pharmacology Fellowship Training Program will continue to emphasize strong laboratory-
based research training in a supportive mentored environment joined with a continually evolving curriculum
and systematic exposure to advances in biomedical and computational science—all directed toward the goal
of preparing each Fellow enrolled in the Program to become a future leader in Clinical Pharmacology in
academia, in industry and in regulatory agencies."
10767282,"ABSTRACT
Obesity is characterized by an excess of white adipose tissue (WAT), which has low metabolic activity. Recent
studies demonstrate that cells in WAT can be driven toward a metabolically active brown adipose phenotype
(termed “beiging”), which is causally associated with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity.
Pharmacologic therapies to stimulate beiging of WAT and activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) may
reduce cardiovascular and diabetes risk in obesity. Cyclic guanylate monophosphate (cGMP) signaling may
positively influence adipose tissue metabolism. cGMP serves as the second messenger for the natriuretic
peptides, which are reduced in obesity. Wild type mice exposed to exogenous natriuretic peptide have
increased expression of brown adipocyte-associated genes in WAT and BAT, providing evidence for beiging of
WAT and activation of BAT. A safe and inexpensive strategy to enhance cGMP signaling in humans is
inhibition of an enzyme involved in its breakdown, phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5). Data on the effects of
PDE5 inhibition on WAT and BAT function in humans are limited. One barrier to human studies has been the
lack of a non-invasive method to detect both activated BAT and beiging of WAT. We have developed and
published a magnetic resonance imaging technique to quantify the full spectrum of lipid metabolism in WAT
and BAT using fat signal fraction (FSF). In preliminary data, we show that 1) cold exposure (a cGMP stimulus)
causes beiging of WAT in humans, 2) chronic PDE5 exposure improves insulin sensitivity in obese adults and,
3) mice treated with PDE5 inhibitors exhibit increased energy expenditure and resistance to weight gain. We
hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition in obese adults will result in beiging of WAT and activation of BAT. We will
perform non-invasive imaging and subcutaneous fat aspiration to link changes in adipose imaging and gene
expression at the same anatomic site for the first time. We will randomize participants to tadalafil (20mg/day) or
placebo for 3 months. Endpoints will be measured at room temperature and after a cold exposure protocol,
which will allow us to determine whether a chronic increase in cGMP tone through PDE5 inhibition “primes”
BAT and WAT for activation in the setting of a natriuretic peptide stimulus. Aim 1 will examine the effect of
PDE5 inhibition on adipose metabolism. We will randomize 100 obese individuals to tadalafil or placebo for 3
months. The primary endpoint is WAT FSF at room temperature. Aim 2 will examine the effect of PDE5
inhibition on subcutaneous WAT gene expression. The primary endpoint will be change in WAT UCP1
expression at 3 months. A secondary aim will link data from Aims 1 and 2 to examine the association between
change in FSF and WAT gene expression after PDE5 inhibition and cold exposure. The importance of this aim
is to establish for the first time in humans the relationship between imaging and molecular markers of adipose
metabolism. Repurposing PDE5 inhibitors could be an important adjunct to lifestyle interventions in an effort to
counter cardiovascular and diabetes risk in obese individuals."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECT 1
Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer among women living with HIV (WLWH). Although cervical cancer
screening is part of routine clinical care for WLWH, this population lacks regular screening, appropriate follow-
up and/or treatment for precancerous lesions and/or cervical cancer. There is no consensus on the most
important social determinants of health (SDoH) associated with access to care across the cervical cancer care
continuum (screening, diagnosis, and treatment) among WLWH. The overall goal of this investigation is to
employ a mixed-methods approach to identify multi-level factors within the SDoH that affect timely access to
cervical cancer care across the cancer care continuum (screening, diagnosis, and treatment) among WLWH in
Puerto Rico (PR). PR is one of the jurisdictions within the United States (US) with a high incidence and
prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and a recent significant increase in the incidence of cervical cancer (2001-2017). Our
specific aims are: (1) To examine the impact of HIV status on the extent and determinants of delay in cervical
cancer care (screening, diagnosis and treatment) among cervical cancer patients diagnosed in PR during the
period 2013-2020; (2) Establish multi-level factors within the SDoH that affect timely cervical cancer care
(screening, diagnosis and treatment) among women with high-grade cervical lesions (HSIL) or cervical cancer
in PR; and (3) Estimate the use of effective primary (HPV vaccination) and secondary (screening for, and treating
HSIL) prevention approaches among women diagnosed with HIV or AIDS in PR for 2023 and 2024. Our ultimate
goal is that all WLWH have equitable health access to cervical cancer care, while reducing morbidity and
mortality associated to this malignancy. This proposal supports a 3-year research and training plan to allow Dr.
Soto to make substantial progress toward a career as an independent investigator and leader in the field of
SDoH, cancer control and HIV. Results from this project will identify intervention opportunities within the SDoH
along the cervical cancer care continuum. Moreover, findings will guide the development and evaluation of these
interventions to reduce barriers to care and ensure health equity among WLWH in a subsequent R01 application.
This information could also potentially be adapted to Hispanic WLWH in the US and in other populations.

10931332,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 1st and 2nd leading cause of cancer death in men and women in Puerto Rico
and the in U.S., respectively. Although CRC incidence and mortality trends have been declining, overall, the
incidence and mortality in individuals younger than 50 years (early-onset CRC) have been rising consistently,
and the incidence of this CRC subtype is projected increase by more than 140% by 2030. Disparities in CRC
incidence and survival have been well documented in racial/ethnic groups in the mainland U.S. However,
aggregating heterogeneous populations, such as Hispanics, conceals the significant variability that
exists within subgroups in terms of CRC incidence and mortality. CRC represents a malignancy with
documented disparities when comparing Hispanics living in Puerto Rico (HPR) with racial/ethnic groups living
in the mainland U.S., yet very little is known regarding early-onset epidemiological trends or the pre-disposing
risk factors in this Hispanic subpopulation. Moreover, the etiology of early-onset CRC and how germline
genetic variation may contribute to early-onset CRC health disparities remain poorly understood. With this in
mind, the main goal of the proposed study is to: (Aim 1) characterize early-onset CRC sociodemographic and
epidemiological trends in Puerto Rico for the first time; (Aim 2) identify germline genetic variants that
predispose individuals to develop CRC before the age of 50; and (Aim 3) establish an early-onset CRC
biospecimen (blood, normal mucosa and tumor tissue, and stool) and organoid biobank. Our central
hypothesis is that we will observe disparities in early-onset CRC incidence and survival in HPR compared to
other racial/ethnic groups in the mainland U.S. and that we will identify novel, unique variants associated with
early-onset CRC in HPR. The successful completion of the proposed specific aims will put the principal
investigator (PI) in a unique and advantageous position by allowing her to develop skills in molecular
epidemiology, germline genetic analysis, and generation of CRC organoids, and in parallel will provide data
that will be used as preliminary data for a future R01 submission examining novel risk-stratification, prevention,
and/or treatment strategies in year 2. This study will significantly advance the field by providing insight into
the factors contributing to the early-onset CRC burden among HPR, the genes and pathways that may
contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis in young individuals (<50 years), and in establishing the first early-onset
CRC biospecimen and organoid biobank in the Caribbean derived from HPR that will enable for future studies
aimed at examining the early-onset CRC risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms, and will make comparisons
to other racial/ethnic groups feasible. All of which, will provide the PI with the foundation to pursue new
research avenues in her independent research program focused on elucidating the factors contributing to this
age and racial/ethnic health disparity."
10931334,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States (US) and Puerto Rico (PR), cancer is the second leading cause of death. Considering that
the population is aging, an increase in the burden of cancer is expected in future years. Consequently, quality
of care at the end of life (EoL) is critical for dying cancer patients and their families. Studies in the US have
shown that EoL care is expensive for cancer patients and frequently has very low or no clinical value, and often
is inconsistent with the patient's needs, values, and preferences. Conversely, timely receipt of palliative and
hospice care can improve quality of life and decrease emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and the
use of life-extending procedures. Even when progress is made towards improving the quality of EoL care, a
growing body of evidence shows disparities among groups within the population. Understanding the different
characteristics that affect the quality of care at the EoL is fundamental to implementing effective interventions
to reduce inequity and improve the efficiency of the healthcare delivery system. There are few studies in the
US and no study in PR evaluating the quality of EoL care from the multilevel perspective. This proposal would
be the first of such a series of investigations. PR has a predominantly Hispanic, low-income, and aging
population with high insurance coverage.
Forty-eight percent of the PR population lives below the poverty level, and there is a shortage of medical
specialists, including palliative medicine. This study provides an opportunity to investigate the variations in the
use of recommended care, its cost, and the provider and patient's behaviors towards EoL decisions. This study
seeks to advance our knowledge and understanding of EoL care among cancer patients by utilizing state-of-
the-art claims data analytics coupled with surveys data collection. Towards this effort, we will merge the Puerto
Rico Central Cancer Registry-Health Insurance Linkage Database with CMS hospice claims data and conduct
physicians, patients, and caregivers’ surveys. Specific Aims are: 1) Assess the use of recommended care and
the cost of care among cancer patients nearing EoL in PR; 2) Examine the perceived barriers to EoL
discussion and decision-making process among oncologists in PR; and 3) Determine the knowledge, attitudes,
and EoL planning among cancer patients and their caregivers in PR. This study will provide new evidence that
will help us understand the complex process of EoL care and how different factors interact. Our most important
contribution will be to document the potential multilevel influences on EoL care.
This information will be essential for developing and implementing a multilevel intervention to improve the
quality of care at the EoL. We expect our results can help improve health care delivery and enhance cancer
patients' overall quality of life in a cost-effective way."
10931335,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have not reduced the disproportional incidence and prevalence of oral
human papilloma virus (HPV) and oropharyngeal cancers in people living with HIV (PLWH), suggesting ART
alone may not fully restore mucosal immunity. This may be because HIV alters the oral microbiome, affecting
mucosal immunity, and biological aging, such as changes in DNA methylation and immune senescence, can
worsen HIV-associated immunosuppression. Reshaping the microbiome or reprogramming DNA methylation
patterns may be a safe way to identify, prevent, or treat HPV persistence; however, understanding how these
factors interact to promote cancer is a crucial gap in our existing knowledge. Our objective is to investigate
these two biological processes (oral microbiome, biological aging), combined with socioeconomic and behavioral
factors (sexual practices, lifestyle factors) to determine the impact of the natural history of HPV infection in
PLWH, and to construct a machine learning classifier using these factors that can predict HPV infection and
persistence. Our overarching hypothesis is that dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and older methylation aging
are risk factors for HPV-related complications and can dampen the mucosal immune response in PLWH.
Therefore, this proposed longitudinal study plans to collect saliva at two time points (baseline and after six
months) from 150 virologically suppressed PLWH (men and women, ≥21 years old) from Puerto Rico CoNCRA,
a community-based organization specialized in the prevention and treatment of HIV. PLWH who attend PR
CoNCRA constitute a unique high-risk group where the prevalence of both HIV and oral HPV infection is higher,
allowing our team of experts in HIV, HPV, epidemiology, cancer biology, oral health and bioinformatics to
establish these relationships with high efficiency. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine how
HPV incident infection and persistence affects the oral microbiome and oxidative stress in saliva in PLWH, (ii) to
characterize the oral methylome of PLWH with and without HPV and assess the impact of methylation aging in
the natural history of HPV infection, and (iii) to construct a diagnostic and prognostic classiﬁer based on biological
data (microbiome and methylation) and socio-behavioral characteristics capable of discriminating HPV infection
and persistence among PLWH. We will characterize the oral microbiota by 16S rDNA sequencing, HPV
genotypes by PCR, DNA methylation by Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadChip arrays and oxidative stress by
immuno spectrophotometry assays. Additionally, remaining saliva and voluntary blood collection will be used to
create a biorepository for future research. This study leverages resources from the UPRCCC and CePCHE
including (i) the UPRCCC Biobank for the biospecimen storage, (ii) the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core for
assistance in the analyses and storage of the data generated, and (iii) the Outreach Core to help with participant
recruitment and promotion of his project. This study will also provide data needed for R01 submission, and

10781945,"DBS therapy for Parkinson Disease [PD], the primary, FDA-approved surgical approach, has proven efficacious in clinical trials. However, this continuous stimulation therapy is limited to treatment of a subset of motor symptoms (i.e., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and dyskinesias) and requires considerable postoperative clinical adjustment to treat symptoms. Improvements to DBS for PD are being tested, including changes in patterns of stimulation, additional targets, and multiple electrodes. However, a critical new approach involves autonomous parameter adjustment [adaptive DBS] using surrogate physiological biomarkers relevant to clinical symptoms. These biomarkers and autonomous control may be useful for dynamic adjustment, subsequent programming, and long-term optimization of parameters. Adaptive DBS involves recording surrogate signals and developing a control policy that relates these signals to activity through parameter adjustments. This approach could improve DBS therapy across multiple time scales, including short-term dynamics (i.e., over minutes), initial programming (over weeks to months), and long-term, depending on the time course of response to DBS. However, which biomarkers are useful at these various time scales and appropriate, multi- layered control policy, will require testing in comparison to continuous DBS for relative efficacy and efficiency. We hypothesize that integrating multiple biomarkers (in addition to beta band oscillations) across multiple time scales will provide more efficacious adaptive DBS control. To test this hypothesis we will perform long-term recordings of multiple, relevant biomarkers from humans with implanted, advanced implantable pulse generators [IPGs], comparing internal control modes to highly complex external control modes. These clinical experiments will focus on a small, pilot clinical study (n = 6 PD patients) who have undergone implantation of bilateral subthalamic nucleus [STN] and globus pallidus [GP] DBS electrodes, with all 4 electrodes connected to a single Medtronic Summit RC+S recording and stimulating IPG. We have formally analyzed this cohort for efficacy at 1 year, showing that combined STN + GP stimulation is both preferred and better compared to either site alone. We will analyze the comparative efficacy of internal (embedded, available within the IPG) simple adaptive DBS to external (distributed) adaptive DBS, which allows both integrating multiple biomarkers and using a complex, multiple time scale control policy. We will further develop a proportional control feedback program, which specifically integrates the time multiple time constants of PD symptoms, to optimally control PD symptom. These clinical experiments in a unique cohort of research patients will lead to multiple novel outcomes, continuing a direct, within-person comparison of STN, GP, and combined DBS efficacy, analyzing an optimal mix of surrogate biomarkers for enhancing DBS efficacy, and defining an optimal, scalar feedback, proportional control system for treatment on various time scales."
10788345,"My laboratory focuses on the structure, function, and mechanisms of microbial rhodopsins, widespread visual
pigment-like proteins with diverse functions. Over the past decade, a subfamily, light-gated ion channels
(channelrhodopsins), have had exceptional impact because of their central role in the transformative technology
of optogenetics. We originally found them in the chlorophyte alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as phototaxis
receptors that depolarize the cell membrane by producing cation currents in response to light. Subsequently
neuroscientists found that these light-gated cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs) expressed in neurons produce
depolarizing currents that enable light to trigger action potentials. Targeted photoactivation of neurons enabled
by expression of CCRs in neural circuits has proven to be a powerful technique transforming many aspects of
neuroscience research. Nevertheless, their light-gated channel activity is one of the least understood rhodopsin
functions in terms of molecular mechanisms. Several advances in our work over the past 5 years, coupled to our
knowledge and expertise over decades of research on microbial rhodopsins, guide our current research strategy.
In 2015 we discovered exclusively anion-conducting (physiologically Cl-) channelrhodopsins (ACRs) in the
distant phylum of cryptophyte algae. A breakthrough for optogenetics, ACRs enable efficient light-induced
hyperpolarization and therefore are potent inhibitors of neuron firing. Also seminal to our research plans, our
recent crystal structure of the most used ACR in optogenetics (GtACR1 from Guillardia theta) revealed a
preexisting tunnel in the closed dark state that we propose is the channel closed by 3 well-defined constrictions.
The GtACR1 tunnel is the only candidate ion pathway imaged in a channelrhodopsin, and provides a valuable
resource for elucidating the mystery of channel gating by light. Principles learned from our study will likely
enhance our understanding also of other microbial rhodopsins. Our current research investigates the diversity
and molecular mechanisms of channelrhodopsins by: (i) ongoing genome mining to expand our knowledge and
also advance optogenetics, focused on ACRs, but including CCRs (e.g. possible K+ and Ca++ channels).
Recently we identified two new ACR families and long-sought red-shifted ACRs (“RubyACRs”) activated by
tissue-penetrating long wavelengths, valuable for optogenetics and opening the way to elucidating color tuning
mechanisms of channelrhodopsins; (ii) unraveling the relationship of electrical steps in channel function to
photochemical transitions by structure-based mutagenesis, photo-electrophysiology in vivo, and kinetic optical
and vibrational spectroscopy in vitro; and (iii) determination of atomic structures by X-ray crystallography and
cryoEM, including innovative approaches to image the transient open-channel conformation. Elucidating
mechanisms of channelrhodopsins will advance basic science and also facilitate engineering to optimize and
tailor them for new optogenetic applications."
10783077,"SUMMARY
 Precise regulation of atrial gene expression is crucial to maintain atrial homeostasis, and disorders or gene
mutations that impact atrial gene expression can cause atrial fibrillation (AF), a serious arrhythmia that affects
an estimated 33 million people worldwide. However, there remain many gaps in our understanding of atrial
gene regulation, including the mechanisms that underlie chamber-selective gene expression. Human genetic
studies have shown that sequence variants near the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 are associated
with greater AF risk, and mice with Tbx5 deficiency develop AF. Although recent work has identified some
TBX5-regulated genes that contribute to AF susceptibility, the atrial TBX5-centered transcriptional network is
incompletely explored. Elucidation of this network and its sensitivity to TBX5 dose would reveal nodal points in
AF pathogenesis and may suggest new approaches to prevent or treat AF. The overarching goal of this re-
search proposal is to elucidate the atrial gene regulatory network and how it is perturbed in AF. The proposal
buillds on novel reagents and techniques developed in the Pu lab to interrogate transcriptional mechanisms in

tion (bioChIP-seq), massively parallel in vivo measurement of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity (AAV-
MPRA assay), and mosaic gene inactivation strategies to hone in direct, cell autonomous effects of gene inac-
tivation. In Aim 1, we use bioChIP-seq and AAV-MPRA to define atrial CREs and to dissect the sequence fea-
tures required for their chamber selective activity. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of TBX5 deficiency on the
occupancy of other TFs and p300, the activity of CREs, and the expression of atrial genes. We use these data
to define the TBX5-centered atrial gene regulatory network, and to determine how this network is perturbed by
TBX5 haploinsufficiency or knockout. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis, suggested by our preliminary data, that
TBX5 regulates atrial genes through functional and physical interaction with TEAD1. Successful completion of
this proposal will lead to new insights into atrial gene regulation and its perturbation in AF."

 Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, and
these diseases lack effective therapeutics. We currently lack an understanding of the molecular and
cellular mechanisms controlling protein aggregation in the human brain, which would enable new
therapeutic strategies.
 The protein tau aggregates in the brain in a number of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies,
including Alzheimer's Disease. In early stages of disease, tau aggregates only in specific neurons despite
being expressed in every neuron in the brain, implying that specific factors in the cellular environment
predispose tau to aggregation. Similarly, tau mutations are associated with the onset of only specific
tauopathies. Together, these disease features imply that tau is exquisitely sensitive to both its sequence
properties and its cellular environment.
 Post-translational modifications (PTM) are a mechanism by which the cellular environment can act on a
protein similarly to mutation. Tau is heavily post-translationally modified and changes to tau PTMs are correlated
with progression of disease. Indeed, tau phosphorylation and proteolysis have been proposed to be central
events in the onset and progression of tauopathies. Similarly, mutations are correlated with early disease onset
and are known to hasten in vitro tau aggregation. Mutations can also cause changes in PTMs by changing tau
interaction partners. The function and causality of these changes to tau sequence, however, is unknown. I
hypothesize that PTMs and mutations license tau to access specific conformations to form aggregates.
 The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively identify (1) the biological basis of tau PTM
changes and (2) how tau mutation and PTMs cause aggregation. I have shown that mitochondrial electron
transport chain dysfunction causes a remodeling of tau PTMs, including the accumulation of a tau proteolytic
fragment. In Aim 1, I will acquire new training in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to determine the tau
PTM changes that occur due to ETC dysfunction and how those control tau aggregation. In Aim 2, I will use deep
mutational scanning (DMS) to comprehensively probe tau's sequence-structure relationship. As part of Aim 2, I
will use cross-link MS to directly compare in vitro and in vivo tau states to will reveal the structural mechanisms
for the identified PTM and sequence changes. I am ideally positioned to complete the proposed research, as
this proposal complements my training in protein biophysics and functional genomics in iPSC-derived neurons
with novel MS-based techniques. Completion of this proposal will identify which PTMs and mutations control
tau aggregation, as well as the development of new technologies to probe tau structure in vitro and in vivo.
Completion of this proposal will provide me with essential skills and training to be a successful independent
investigator."

Evaluation and improvement of cancer care delivery is of growing interest nationally, with a pressing need for
research to support decisions by policy makers, hospital systems, payers, clinicians, and patients. Yet, there
are a limited number of investigators with appropriate training to conduct rigorous research in this field. To
address this need, the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center seeks to renew its T32 Cancer Care
Quality Training Program (CCQTP) (Years 16-20). During the next five years, the CCQTP proposes to support
pre- and postdoctoral fellows yearly and train them for careers in multidisciplinary and collaborative research
focused on quality of cancer care delivery. Led by two co-directors, Dr. Ethan Basch and Dr. Stephanie
Wheeler, an internal Steering Committee, and an interdisciplinary External Advisory Board, the CCQTP trains
a variety of fellows, including health services researchers, epidemiologists, and physicians in relevant
disciplines. The CCQTP has five objectives for our trainees: 1) to master a content area and demonstrate
competence in pertinent research methods; 2) to develop collaborative capability by learning the basic
principles of complementary content areas; 3) to gain mentored research expertise with the guidance of
multidisciplinary preceptors; 4) to develop professional skills required for a successful research career,
including presenting research findings, writing for publication, and securing research funding; and 5) to
incorporate principles of equity and inclusivity in research and professional activities. The flexible training is
tailored to suit each fellow's needs and includes three basic elements: a) a specialized core curriculum that
includes coursework, enrichment programs (seminars, special workshops, journal clubs, etc.) and training in
the responsible conduct of research; b) hands-on research experience directed by teams of experienced
faculty preceptors; and c) professional development, including experience in grant writing. Training generally
lasts for two years, with salaries and research/development allowances designed to be consistent with other
training programs at UNC. The outstanding research environment at UNC includes well-funded and nationally
recognized programs in Cancer Health Policy and Management; Epidemiology; Pharmacoeconomics; and
Clinical Medicine. The CCQTP enjoys close collaborations with the nationally recognized UNC Gillings School
of Global Public Health, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and
makes use of core facilities in each. Our 18 Preceptors and 17 Affiliates have been selected for their strong
records of scholarship, funding, and mentorship. CCQTP trainees have cumulatively produced 996
publications and most alumni are in academic research positions. Based on our successes over the past 15
years and our strong candidate pool, we seek to expand from 3 pre- and 3 postdoctoral fellows to 4 and 3,
which the rich environment at UNC and well-developed mentorship model can comfortably accommodate."

constraints impact the efficient breeding and availability of these NHP models. First, since most
the identified diseases display autosomal recessive i nheritance, on average only 1 in 4 offspring produced by
allele carriers is homozygous and affected. There are often insufficient numbers of breeding age male and
allele carriers to produce sufficient subjects in a timely way. Second, for ultra-rare alleles, breeding may

overcome these challenges, we aim to generate a National NHP Model Embryo Resource (NNMER).
Oregon NPRC (ONPRC) will optimize and implement state-of-the-art protocols for NHP gamete collection,
 vitro f ertilization, blastocyst genotyping and embryo cryopreservation of affected and carrier embryos of
 characterized disease models. Moreover, the ONPRC wil provide training and support for veterinary
 at five partnering NPRCs to ensure t he efficient collection of gametes from both current and newly
 disease model carriers located at each center. The long-term goal is to provide a biomedically-
 national resource, accessible to any investigator interested in NHP genetic models, that will enable
preclinical research and therapeutic development. To achieve these oals, we propose the following
 (1) To establish a national NHP genetic disease model gamete, embryo and fibroblast resource and a
searchable tool for the long-term preservation of and accessibility to valuable NHP disease models;
support nationwide collection of NHP gametes and the generation of genotyped model embryos by providing
 in state-of-the-art assisted reproductive technologies; and (3) To promote widespread use of the NHP
 disease embryo resource through systematic outreach efforts aimed at reaching both clinicians and
investigators nationwide. This proposed highly novel resource will provide powerful, genetically parallel,

The Intensive Summer Research Training in Emergency Medicine (ISTEM) program had been instrumental in
expanding the number of medical students exposed to clinical research at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The goal of the program is to engage rising second-year UNC-CH medical students in
research on topics related to emergency medicine and heart, lung, and blood with the intent of recruiting
physicians into a lifelong research career. This application is for a renewal to continue the ISTEM program that
was funded in 2017. We filled 28 of our 30 positions (~6 per year) and all trainees completed the program. Of
the 28 trainees, 3 were underrepresented minority medical students and 8 were female. Twenty-one of the
trainees presented posters at the UNC-CH John B. Graham Student Research Day, 4 presented posters at
American Heart Association national meetings, and 6 have published in peer reviewed journals. These
numbers speak to the success of the ISTEM program in its first 5 years. We are requesting from the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to continue ISTEM with 8 short-term trainee slots per year.
The aims of the program are the following: Aim 1. To match selected ISTEM trainees to outstanding, NIH-
funded research mentors who will provide a productive and rigorous environment for conducting a summer
research project in an area of importance to NHLBI; Aim 2. To provide ISTEM trainees with a formative
educational experience in the goals, methods, and challenges of research in emergency medicine settings,
including topics on research ethics and reproducibility; and Aim 3. To track the outcomes of ISTEM trainees to
determine the success of the program and to improve and expand this training opportunity. The training
program will extend over 8-12 weeks during the summer. Trainees will be mentored by well-published and
funded physicians and scientists with expertise in emergent conditions, cardiovascular and pulmonary health,
blood and bleeding disorders, health services, and epidemiology. The ISTEM program administrative team will
consist of two program co-directors, an administrator, and an advisory committee. Key activities in the training
sequence include the identification of top medical students through a competitive application and review
process, weekly didactic seminars in research and manuscript writing, completion of a research project with a
mentor, abstract development and presentation, and program evaluation. New to this renewal application, we
will evaluate ISTEM’s ability to increase research competencies using the Research Self-Efficacy Scale to
assess the trainees’ confidence in research tasks before and after the program. Trainee outcomes consist of
increased understanding and practice of research design and implementation, increased experience with
mentor-mentee relationships, completed presentations and publications, and increased trainee self-awareness
related to their future research goals and interests. We are confident that ISTEM will provide a strong
foundation for our trainees to build towards academic careers that will advance NHLBI research."

Almost a third of adult Americans suffer from an anxiety disorder, carrying an enormous
personal, societal and financial burden. Anxiety disorders are complex circuit-based conditions,
resulting from dysfunction in a number of distributed regions, connections, and cell types that
generate normal adaptive behavior. Thus, a deeper understanding of how these neural circuits
become disrupted to generate maladaptive behavior is crucial if we hope to generate new
treatments. In recent years, we have shown that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is an central
node in the extended circuit that generates adaptive avoidance behavior. However, the input-
output organization of the ventral hippocampus in the control of anxiety-related behavior
remains poorly understood. Here, we will use functional imaging of large populations of
anatomically defined vHPC neurons, optical manipulation of these neurons, and high resolution
behavioral analyses to expand our understanding of how the extended ventral hippocampal
network controls behavior. We will first determine the encoding properties of vHPC output
neurons to subcortical areas known to drive avoidance and anxiety-like behavior. Then, we will
adopt new unsupervised behavioral classification tools for understanding anxiety-related
behavior in mice to determine how vHPC projection neurons orchestrate distinct behavioral
states. Finally, we will determine how distinct inputs to the differentially modulate avoidance
behavior and shape anxiety-related representations in vHPC. This will provide the most detailed
functional map of the extended hippocampal circuit that controls avoidance behavior, and
provide novel targets for generation of therapeutics for the treatment of anxiety disorders."

A remarkable feature of the nervous system is its ability to adjust stereotyped behavioral responses in a context
dependent manner. In vertebrates, sudden and intense acoustic stimuli evoke an evolutionarily conserved startle
response. While the execution of the acoustic startle response is extremely stereotyped, response probability is
modulated in a context-dependent manner. For example, repeated presentation of a startling stimulus
suppresses a behavioral response, representing a simple form of learning known as habituation. In humans,
modulation of startle behavior is impaired in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including in Attention Deficit-
Hyperactivity Disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms
underlying startle modulation not well understood. Zebrafish show a remarkable behavioral plasticity, and we
have previously shown that larvae exhibit modulation of the acoustic startle response- including prepulse
inhibition and habituation- with behavioral and pharmacological characteristics similar to those in mammals. We
previously conducted the first forward genetic screen in vertebrates to isolate mutants defective in startle
modulation, and identified 14 mutants with defects in habituation behavior. None of these 14 mutants exhibit
morphological defects or overt defects in startle performance. Importantly, five of the six mutants we cloned so
far encode genes previously not implicated in vertebrate habituation. Here we propose to build on our success
in using a molecular genetics, phenotype based strategy to decipher the molecular and circuits mechanisms that
drive vertebrate habituation behavior. Specifically, rather than focusing on a single habituation gene, our strategy
is to continue to use whole genome sequencing to clone six additional mutants from our screen. Combined with
the six mutants we have already cloned, this provides an unparalleled toolbox critical to attain a comprehensive
model of the molecular-genetic and circuit mechanisms underlying habituation. Simultaneously, we focus on
select genes as entry points to further link genetic mutants to behavioral phenotypes and to decipher the
molecular and circuit mechanisms that regulate behavior. The experiments in this proposal will: (1) use a
molecular genetic approach including transgenic behavioral rescue to identify the neuronal populations in which
three genes critical for habituation function; (2) to use molecular and pharmacogenetic approaches in conjunction
with a behavioral assay to determine the signaling pathways through which the adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit
(AP2s1) critical for receptor endocytosis and the huntingtin interacting gene hip14 promote habituation; and 3)
to use an established whole genome sequencing/bioinformatics pipeline to identify the causative gene mutations
for six additional habituation mutants isolated from our genetic screen, generate CRISPR/Cas9 alleles to confirm
their identity and determine their expression in the brain. Combined this will provide both breadth and depth both
at the molecular and at the circuit level critical to comprehensively address fundamental molecular genetic
questions in vertebrate startle modulation, also relevant to human disease conditions."
10765616,"Project Summary: The current and 7th pandemic of Vibrio cholerae caused by the El Tor biotype encodes two
novel genetic islands called the Vibrio Seventh Pandemic Islands 1 and 2 (VSP-1 and VSP-2). Although
acquisition of these islands is proposed to be key to initiation of the 7th pandemic, the function of these genes
remains virtually unknown. The over-arching purpose of this proposal is to understand the function and regulation
of a novel bacterial cytidine deaminase (CDA) regulatory system that we have discovered is encoded on VSP-1
and in many other Proteobacteria. This new CDA regulatory system consists of the multi-domain protein we
named DcdV (deoxycytidine deaminase Vibrio) and its inhibitor named DifV (DcdV inhibitory factor Vibrio)
encoded in a 222 NT region 5’ of dcdV. These genes were first identified as our bioinformatic analysis indicated
that they significantly cooccur in bacterial genomes with the VSP-1 encoded DncV/CapV cyclic GMP-AMP phage
defense system that we previously discovered. Consistent with a potential role of DcdV-DifV to regulate phage
defense, expressing DcdV in the absence of difV causes cell filamentation and disruption of dNTP pools in V.
cholerae and Escherichia coli. Deoxycytidine deaminases (DCD) enzymes play critical roles in maintaining
nucleotide homeostasis, hypermutation, and viral defense in both bacteria and eukaryotes, but in numerous
respects, DcdV and its orthologs are quite different from any other previously studied DCDs. For example, all
previously described DCDs are single domain proteins, while DcdV has an associated N-terminal nucleotide
kinase (NK) domain that our genetic studies show is essential for DcdV activity. Furthermore, other DCDs are
negatively regulated by allosteric binding of dTTP, while DcdV is instead regulated by DifV. For a litany of reasons
based on preliminary studies described in the proposal, we hypothesize that activation of DcdV via inhibition of
DifV skews the cellular nucleotide pool. More specifically, DcdV drives an increase in dUTP concentration and
decrease in dCTP and dTTP concentrations as a two-fold phage defense mechanism, i.e., preventing
accumulation of dNTP substrates for phage genome replication and promoting dUMP incorporation into phage
genomes. Exactly how DcdV functions mechanistically, how this function is inhibited by DifV, and the contribution
of this system to bacterial survival, for example, as part of a phage defense mechanism remains to be elucidated.
We propose to study the mechanistic basis of DcdV function, its regulation by DifV, and the biological contribution
of this newly discovered regulatory system to bacterial physiology in V. cholerae and other bacteria. These aims
will be pursued at the cellular and atomic level using the tools of cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, microscopy,
and structural biology. By defining the mechanism and function of this novel CDA regulatory system we expect
that our research will have a broad impact in multiple disciplines across both prokaryotic and eukaryotic fields."
10738777,"Project Summary
 Staphylococci are ubiquitous bacterial residents of human skin and major causes of antibiotic-resistant
infections. Of the ~40 skin-associated species, S. aureus and S. epidermidis have the greatest pathogenic
potential: S. aureus is the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections and S. epidermidis is the most common
cause of infections associated with indwelling medical devices. Compounding the problem, S. epidermidis strains
harbor a reservoir of genes that enhance fitness/virulence (e.g. genes that encode toxins and antibiotic
resistance) which can be horizontally transferred to S. aureus. In light of these facts, a thorough understanding
of the mechanisms that regulate horizontal gene transfer between these species would be an invaluable asset
in neutralizing or stemming the flow of these factors at the source. In this context, staphylococcal phages (i.e.
viruses) and the immune systems targeted against them have profound impacts on staphylococcal survival and
pathogenesis. For instance, lysogenic phages can enhance pathogenic potential by transferring pathogenicity
islands from one strain to another and carrying virulence factors that integrate along with the phage genome into
the host. In contrast, strictly lytic phages can kill the bacterial host within minutes and are being used as
alternative therapeutics to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. Bacterial immune systems target lytic and
lysogenic phages alike, and can therefore counter these opposing effects. As it stands, we are only just beginning
to understand these dynamics and identify the specific immune systems that staphylococci employ, and
alarmingly, almost nothing is known about how these systems are horizontally spread. These knowledge gaps
continue to undermine our ability to implement effective therapeutics and improve overall healthcare outcomes.
The long-term objective of this R01 project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the anti-phage immune
systems in staphylococci and the pathways by which they spread. Towards this goal, this research uses S.
epidermidis and a collection of diverse phages as model organisms to achieve three specific aims: Aim 1 will
identify and characterize new anti-phage defenses in a suite of S. epidermidis clinical isolates using genetics,
biochemical, and bioinformatics approaches. Aim 2 will determine the major genetic and environmental factors
that drive mobilization of these defenses using molecular and genetic approaches. Aim 3 seeks to determine the
global impacts of the molecular machinery that mediate defense mobilization using high-throughput genetics
approaches. By revealing new insights into mechanisms of anti-phage defenses in staphylococci and the
pathways by which they spread, the proposed work will enable the development of more effective approaches
for not only combatting the spread of resistance to antibiotics but also saving the burgeoning phage therapeutics
from a similar fate. This work will also open up exciting new research directions in understanding staphylococci
and other organisms that harbor similar systems."
10810839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Alterations in the PI3K pathway occur in 40-60% of ER+ breast cancer or AR+ breast cancer, representing the
most common genomic alteration in such tumors, and indicating that the PI3K signaling pathway plays an
important role in the tumorigenesis of hormone-dependent tumors. There is important bidirectional regulatory
crosstalk between PI3K and ER or AR signaling in breast and prostate cancers respectively, leading to tumors
that adapt and survive when either single pathway is pharmacologically inhibited. Mechanistically, we
demonstrated that PI3K inhibition activates ER activity to drive the growth of in ER+/PIK3CA mutant tumors,
through regulation of the histone methyltransferase KMT2D. KMT2D is phosphorylated by the PI3K effectors
AKT1/SGK1, which inhibits its recruitment to chromatin and its role as a coactivator at ER target genes in breast
cancer. Upon PI3K inhibition, this inhibitory phosphorylation is lost, allowing KMT2D to drive ER-dependent
transcription. We hypothesized that KMT2D could be a common mechanism in controlling nuclear hormone
receptor function, PI3K pathway crosstalk, and ER and AR luminal cell differentiation in breast and prostate
models respectively. Preliminary data have shown that KMT2D is required for ER and AR transcriptional activity
upon PI3K inhibition in breast and prostate cancers respectively. Furthermore, KMT2D loss sensitizes cancer
cells to PI3K/AKT inhibition in cells, tumors, and patient derived organoids. We now aim to characterize the
epigenetic and transcriptional role of KMT2D as a key modulator of AR/ER nuclear receptor activity in cells and
organoids using bulk epigenomic and single cell sequencing (Aim 1). We have also identified the lysine
methyltransferase SMYD2 as a novel level of regulator of KMT2D and ER/AR activity. We now plan to elucidate
the role of SMYD2-catalyzed-mediated methylation on KMT2D activity and cofactor associations in breast and
prostate cancer models (Aim 2). Additional preliminary data demonstrate that SMYD2 loss can sensitize tumors
further to PI3K/AKT inhibition. To this end, we aim to determine the role that the genetic manipulation or
pharmacological inhibition of SMYD2 has in the therapeutic response to PI3K/AKT inhibitors in breast and
prostate cancer (Aim 3). Altogether, this proposal is benefiting from i) a multidisciplinary team of collaborators
who are experts in breast and prostate cancer research, protein methylation, and epigenetics, ii) unique patient
resources and reagents, iii) robust preliminary data propelled by at least of 7 years momentum as a leader in the
field of nuclear receptor regulation which will be critical to design new and improved therapies for hormone-
dependent tumors."

Technological developments and the increased pace of data generation in mass spectrometry (MS) now enable

10772007,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by the progressive remodeling of
pulmonary arteries (PAs). It is incurable and leads to death from right ventricular heart failure in 3 years if
untreated. Heterozygous mutations of the bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor gene (BMPR2) are the
leading genetic cause of both heritable and non-heritable PAH. Compared to patients without BMPR2
mutations, PAH patients with BMPR2 mutations develop a more severe form of PAH at least 10 years earlier.
Despite the progress in understanding the molecular and cellular processes mediating occlusive remodeling of
PAs as a result of BMPR2 mutations, a targeted therapy does not yet exist, and BMPR2 carrier patients remain
at high risk of requiring transplantation and succumbing to the disease. There is a dire need of novel therapies
for BMPR2 mutation patients.
 Our studies demonstrated increased DNA damage in both idiopathic- and heritable-PAH patients,
suggesting genotoxic stress is a risk factor for PAH, but significant knowledge gaps persist, as follows: (i)
whether the loss of genome integrity is the cause or the consequence of PAH, (ii) the cell type in which DNA
damage occur, (iii) a potential link between BMPR2 mutations and DNA damage, and (iv) the molecular
mechanism of DNA damage in PAH. We found that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are
essential to protect genome integrity in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), and they act by
maintaining a key component of the DNA repair pathway: Rad51. Inactivation of BMPR2 results in reduction of
Rad51, leading to accumulation of DNA damage in PAECs. Attenuation of Rad51 was measured in the
endothelium of both animal models of PAH and human patients. On the contrary, activation of the BMPR2
signaling pathway by BMP9 restores Rad51 and prevents the accumulation of DNA damage in PAECs. The
main hypothesis we will test is that PAECs undergoing genotoxic stress develop a pathological remodeling and
PAH. The objective of this application is to develop a strategy to restore the DNA repair system in PAECs and
prevent or inhibit the progression of vascular remodeling, as a novel therapy for PAH with a defective BMP
signal. The forthcoming results from this application will provide important insights into developing a novel
therapeutic strategy for PAH."

Concussions in sports have received much focus recently; however, the consequences of non-concussive head
impacts, more common and thus potentially more important, may have a greater influence on brain health in
youth athletes. With ~ 3.5 million football players between ages 6 and 13 each year, there is a critical need to
reduce head impact exposure, thereby improving safety of youth football. Several youth football organizations
have implemented regulations to reduce contact and concussion risk; but we lack biomechanical evidence in
youth football to inform policies on reducing head impact exposure. Football practices are controlled
environments amenable to intervention; however, the most effective targets for intervention or how best to design
and implement effective interventions in this context is unknown. In other areas of research, engaging community
members has repeatedly been shown as essential for successful development, implementation, and sustenance
of viable interventions. The objective is to develop and pilot test an evidence-based intervention to reduce
head impact exposure in youth football, using a community-engaged approach. A comprehensive
mentored training program has been planned, closely aligned with the following research aims. In Aim 1, 30
youth football players participating on two teams at the middle school level (ages 12-14) will be fitted with
mouthpiece-based head impact sensors. Biomechanical data will be collected and quantified during team
activities which will be used to inform discussions with stakeholders (coaches, parents, league officials). Using
an audit and feedback approach, sharing biomechanical data with stakeholders, and an anonymous survey, we
will assess awareness and receptivity to change. In Aim 2, mixed methods will be used to integrate data identified
from literature and Aim 1. Stakeholders will be engaged to identify, develop, and refine evidence-based
strategies to reduce head impact exposure at each level of the social ecological model. Outcomes will include
defined objectives, guidelines, resources, and a timeline for implementation of an intervention. In Aim 3, two new
youth football teams at the middle school level (ages 12-14) will be recruited to pilot-test the intervention
developed in Aim 2. Head impact exposure will be measured from 30 athletes participating on the 2 teams using
head impact sensors and the effectiveness of the intervention at reducing head impact exposure as well as the
feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the intervention will be evaluated. The implementation process will be
monitored and findings will be disseminated to the youth football league. The skills gained, data gathered, and
methods developed in this K25 Award will position the Candidate for success as an independent investigator
combining public health science and injury biomechanics to develop, test, and improve injury prevention
strategies."

 The central objective of this application is to harness unconventional synthetic
building blocks for the development of new, reliable, and efficient, methodologies.
These methodologies are intended to enable the construction of stereochemically rich
scaffolds, including those seen in naturally occurring small molecules and medicines.
The development of new methods and the syntheses of complex small molecules
continues to be vital areas of research. Most medicinal agents on the market are
prepared by organic synthesis, including the large majority of all new drugs that have
become available over the past three decades. The chemical structures of new drug
entities are becoming increasingly complex, now often bearing sp3 centers rather than
“flat” structures. This has led to an increased need for chemists to develop new
methods that can reliably build intricate structures.
 The two unconventional building blocks we seek to harness in the proposed
studies are amides and strained cyclic alkynes and allenes. Regarding amides, the C–N
bond of amides has long been viewed as stable, such that synthetic methodologies that
rely on C–N bond cleavage have remained limited. We seek to develop methods that
utilize nickel catalysis to harness amide functional groups as synthons. We propose to
assemble important linkages with defined stereocenters, including quaternary
stereocenters, using catalysis and chemoenzymatic methods. These efforts provide
new opportunities in the area of strong bond activation by nickel catalysis, along with
new tools for the manipulation of amides via C–N bond cleavage. With regard to
strained cyclic alkynes and allenes, we seek to intercept these transient, highly reactive
species to efficiently build complex molecular scaffolds. Such methods should allow for
the establishment of scaffolds bearing two new bonds and three sp3 centers.
Enantiospecific and catalytic enantioselective variants will be targeted. Our
methodologies will be evaluated in the context of several synthetic endeavors. The
results of our studies should lead to powerful new strategies and tools for accessing
various molecules of importance, including natural products and medicines."
10767818,"Clinical approval of Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) for RNA heralded the advent of nanotechnology-
based pharmacotherapy. Yet, RNA delivery to extra-hepatic sites remains a major unmet challenge.
Weissman pioneered modifications of mRNA providing effective translation in diverse cell types, while
Muzykantov introduced “vascular targeting”, nanomedicine strategy for drug delivery to desired areas
in the vasculature. Here we converge these advances to devise nanocarriers targeting RNA to
desired sites of transgene synthesis and therapeutic action. We found that ligands of Inter-Cellular
Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM) conjugated to nanocarriers, direct ICAM-LNP (ILNP) to accumulate in
lungs, especially, in the inflamed lungs, with trivial cerebral uptake. In opposite, LNP targeting to
Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM) provides trivial pulmonary uptake of VCAM-LNP (VLNP),
and selective uptake in the inflamed brain, surpassing the benchmarks by orders of magnitude. VLNP
loaded with mRNA encoding endothelial multifunctional anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory protein
thrombomodulin (TM) provides transgene synthesis and protective effect in the inflamed CNS
unrivaled by other agents. We will characterize and if needed reiteratively re-engineer targeting
features of this powerful nanotechnology platform, by pursuing the following Specific Aims. Aim 1:
Multi-scale spatiotemporal mapping of vascular targeting of ILNP and VLNP. Using isotope tracing
and real time imaging, in vivo microscopy and flow cytometry, we will define PK/BD, dynamics of LNP
localization and reporter transgene activity in the sites of desirable therapeutic action. Aim 2:
Targeting therapeutic thrombomodulin RNA to lung and brain. We will characterize salient parameters
of TM transgene expression, beneficial and unintended effects of ILNP and VLNP in naive mice and
in mouse models of pulmonary and cerebral inflammation. Aim 3: Translational development of LNP.
We will upgrade LNP to clinically applicable format via site-specific conjugation of small recombinant
ligands. This study will define key specification parameters of a novel nanotechnology platform for
selective delivery of RNA to desirable cells and cellular compartments in brain, lungs and likely other
organs. It will establish proof of principle for a new nanomedicine approach for effective, specific and
safe biological pharmacotherapy of ALI and stroke, with future expansion to other diseases."
10745927,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is associated with poor prognosis due to its highly invasive and drug-resistant
phenotype. Recurrence is a common phenomenon in GBM patients due to the presence of chemo- and radio-
resistant Brain Tumor-Initiating Cells (BTICs). Consequently, current therapies including surgery followed by
radiation or chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ) failed to improve patient median overall survival
emphasizing the necessity of novel treatment strategies for drug-resistant GBM. Interestingly, Neuroplin-1
(NRP1) has been shown to be implicated in the drug-resistance and stemness in multiple types of cancer.
Recently, we showed that depletion of NRP1 improved survival compared to that of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF-A) depletion in mice bearing patient-derived GBM xenografts. NRP1 depletion also improved
sensitivity to TMZ and enhanced the overall survival when combined with TMZ. Our preliminary data further
showed that a proprietary tumor-targeted liposomal (TTL) formulation combining a first generation small-
molecule NRP1 inhibitor (EG00229; G in short) with Everolimus (E) provided significant survival advantage in
TMZ resistant glioma cells as compared to that of TMZ alone. However, EG00229 is poorly water soluble, and
its liposomal formulation is not stable for long term storage. Hence, we developed a new generation of small-
molecule NRP1 inhibitors (NRP1i, Ni in short) with better solubility in order to create a stable liposomal
formulation. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that NRP1i combined with everolimus in a single payload
using TTL, either as a systemic therapy or delivered locally in a hydrogel-based system, will reduce drug-
resistance and stemness and augment radiation sensitivity in GBM, leading to better therapeutic outcomes. To
validate our hypothesis, we propose three major aims. In Aim 1, we will combine the most effective NRP1i with
everolimus as a single payload in TTL formulation (TTL-ENi) for evaluating in vitro efficacy in inhibiting stemness
and drug-resistance signaling pathways and in vivo studies using multiple therapy resistance BTICs animal
models including immune-competent mice models. Further, the additive effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy
(e.g. TMZ) in combination with the TTL-ENi will be evaluated. We will also analyze the effect of our proposed
therapy on the tumor immune microenvironment using two state-of-the-art techniques namely mass cytometry
(CyTOF) and digital spatial profiling (DSP). In Aim 2, we will assess the efficacy of the local administration of
TTL-ENi-hydrogel in a resection and recurrence model of GBM. Moreover, the additive effect of radiotherapy
and chemotherapy (e.g. TMZ) in combination with the TTL-ENi-hydrogel will be evaluated. Aim 3 will focus on
the comparative pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary toxicity studies of the most potent
formulation for future clinical trials. We expect that a successful execution of our proposed research will lead to
clinical trial in near future for a better therapeutic strategy to override the drug-resistance in GBM patients as
well as patients suffering from other drug-resistant cancers."

We propose that the features of germinal center biology important for developing high affinity B cells to a very
difficult epitope, such as a tier 2 nAb epitope on HIV Env trimer, are very different than the well characterized
features of GC biology for conventional antigens, such as haptens. We have demonstrated that slow delivery
immunization changes fundamental aspects of the immune response, which can result in dramatic
improvements in nAb responses (Cell 2019). Conventional immunization strategies will likely be insufficient for
the development of a bnAb vaccine to HIV or other difficult pathogens due to the immunological hurdles posed,
including B cell immunodominance and GC quantity and quality. We found that two independent methods of
slow delivery immunization of RMs resulted in more robust Tfh cells and more GC B cells with Env-binding,
tracked by longitudinal lymph node (LN) fine needle aspirates (FNA) 1. Improved GCs correlated with the
development of > 20-fold higher titers of autologous tier 2 neutralizing Abs (nAbs). BCR sequencing and Ab
mapping demonstrated targeting of immunodominant non-neutralizing (nnAb) epitopes by conventional bolus
immunized animals, while slow delivery immunized animals targeted a more diverse set of epitopes, including
multiple tier 2 nAb epitopes. We will continue these groundbreaking studies to use novel slow release
technologies to probe the biology of germinal centers relevant to affinity maturation against a difficult HIV trimer
immunogen in non-human primates (NHP, rhesus macaques)."
10757720,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a serious side effect that causes morbidity
and limits the dose of chemotherapy allowed to treat cancers. In most classes of neurotoxic
chemotherapeutics, CIPN manifests as damage to dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons. The
neuronal damage is thought to be due to an unelucidated combination of dysfunctional microtubules,
axonal transport and mitochondria that ultimately leads to programmed axonal degeneration via a
nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 2 (NMNAT2) and Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif
Containing 1 (SARM1) pathway. The link between these processes, however, remains entirely
unknown.
Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dorsal root ganglia sensory neuronal
culture system (iSN), we have identified microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) as a key
determinant of CIPN. When exposed to clinically-relevant doses of bortezomib, paclitaxel or
vincristine, MAP2 levels drop and there is subcellular MAP2 mislocalization in iSN that occurs prior to
axonal degeneration. Critically, overexpression of MAP2 is protective for bortezomib-induced
neurotoxicity in iSN.
In this grant application, we propose to further dissect the role of MAP2 in CIPN by utilizing an
innovative CRISPR-ErCas12a system to develop genetically-engineered iPSC lines that
fluorescently-tag either MAP2 or NMNAT2. These novel iPSC lines will allow for detailed analyses of
the time course of altered subcellular localization and axonal transport, and how these processes link
to SARM1 activation and axonal degeneration. Furthermore, we will investigate the overlapping
mechanisms in CIPN due to bortezomib, paclitaxel, and vincristine using our previously successful
proteomics analysis approach, which now will employ a state-of-the-art quantitative proteomic and
phosphoproteomic technology. The proposed Specific Aims build on existing understanding of the
pathomechanisms of CIPN while innovating into unexplored novel areas that are potential targets for
preventative therapeutic development."
10766693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, leading to morbidity and mortality in
1-2% of the population and contributing signiﬁcantly to global health care costs. For patients in whom AF can-
not be treated by drugs, the recommended therapy is catheter-based ablation to isolate arrhythmia triggers and
eliminate the substrate for arrhythmia perpetuation. The success rate of catheter ablation in rhythm controlled
AF patients is 50-75%, and is worse in patients with persistent AF. The mechanisms by which baseline and
post-ablation atrial remodeling, including atrial distension, functional impairment, and ﬁbrosis, contribute to AF
recurrence following catheter ablation, are not well understood and the underling factors have not been charac-
terized. Understanding atrial remodeling in drug-refractory AF patients and discovering new personalized
strategies for successful AF ablation and prevention of AF recurrence is a quest of paramount clinical
signiﬁcance. There is an urgent need to develop new approaches to ablation that account mechanistically for the
remodeling of the atrial substrate post-procedure, and thereby improve the efﬁcacy of the therapy and eliminate
repeat procedures.
 The overall objective of this application is to use novel combination of imaging, artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI), electroanatomical mapping, and mechanistic computational modeling to understand the causes for
AF recurrence in drug-refractory AF patients and to develop a new paradigm for personalized ablation
that eliminates repeat procedures. Leveraging our advancements in the acquisition of high-quality atrial im-
ages, our expertise in AI and particularly deep learning, and our ability to efﬁciently generate personalized com-
putational atrial models, we propose to characterize baseline atrial remodeling in shape, structure and function
as well as its progression post-procedure. Using the obtained insights, we will develop a comprehensive abla-
tion strategy where AF ablation targets will be determined by reinforcement learning based on the mechanistic
knowledge acquired in the proposed studies. The project will culminate in a pilot prospective patient study that
will test the new ablation strategy. Successful execution of the project will pave the way for a paradigm shift in the
clinical procedure of AF ablation and in the quest to eliminate repeat procedures in drug-refractory AF patients,
resulting in a dramatic improvement in the efﬁcacy of the therapy. Importantly, completion of this project will be
major leap forward in the integration of imaging, AI, and computational modeling in the diagnosis and treatment
of heart rhythm disorders."
10793654,"Project Summary
In addition to the classical mode of phagocytosis and intracellular oxidative killing of pathogens, a recently
discovered antimicrobial function of neutrophils is the formation of extracellular traps (Neutrophil Extracellular
Traps, NETs), which can trap and kill pathogens extracellularly. As NET formation (NETosis) generally requires
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, we and others have found that neutrophils from Chronic
Granulomatous Diseases (CGD) patients and Gp91phox-/- CGD mice with mutations in NADPH oxidase complex
exhibit impaired NET generation in-vitro and in-vivo in response to various stimuli and pulmonary bacterial
infection. We recently reported that Tamoxifen (TMX), an FDA approved selective estrogen receptor (ER)
modifier for treatment of breast cancer, induces antimicrobial NETs in CGD neutrophils in a ROS independent
manner. We further showed that activation of autophagy is necessary and sufficient to induce TMX-mediated
NETs. In addition to this seminal report, the premise of the proposed research is derived from our preliminary
data indicating a novel pathway of ROS-and ER-independent NETosis by TMX via a non-canonical autophagy
activation. The two proposed specific aims will establish TMX as NET-inducing agent with antimicrobial and anti-
inflammatory effect in preclinical murine CGD and human CGD neutrophils (Aim 1); and elucidate TMX-mediated
non-canonical autophagy signaling pathway in neutrophils that culminates in disintegration of nuclear lamina to
facilitate the release of NETs (Aim 2). Our studies provide important mechanistic insights into a novel autophagy
pathway activated by TMX which will have implications not only for NET research but also for exploiting
autophagy and NETs to treat infectious and autoimmune diseases. By leveraging neutrophils from a well-
characterized cohort of CGD patients at NIH Clinical Center, these studies also present an exciting opportunity
for preclinical testing of TMX in CGD to restore antimicrobial function of neutrophils to combat pneumonic
bacterial infections, frequently observed in these patients."

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a major public health burden with high morbidity and mortality.
Identifying novel approaches towards regenerating heart tissue has significant therapeutic potential for heart
failure patients. Similar to lower vertebrates, neonatal mice can regenerate their hearts following injury for a brief
window after birth. Remarkably, we recently discovered that inhibition of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH) can promote adult cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction (MI). Our results
are distinct from the previous studies demonstrating a cardioprotective role for SDH inhibition against the redox
insult during ischemia/reperfusion injury, as we demonstrate that SDH inhibition does not protect the heart
against MI-induced infarction. The metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation in the postnatal heart
contributes to cardiomyocyte cell cycle exit and loss of endogenous cardiac regeneration potential. SDH, also
known as mitochondrial complex II, plays a central role in regulating cellular metabolism as it is involved in both
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Our recently published study
demonstrates that inhibition of SDH by malonate treatment of adult mice following myocardial infarction
stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation, revascularization, and results in restoration of cardiac structure and
function following infarction. Remarkably, our metabolite analysis following SDH inhibition demonstrates dynamic
metabolic changes in the uninjured adult heart. Our overarching hypothesis is that SDH inhibition metabolically
reprograms the adult heart to a regenerative state. To define the role of SDH in adult heart regeneration, we will
pursue the following aims: 1) Elucidate the metabolic and cellular mechanisms underlying post-MI regeneration
following SDH inhibition; 2) Define the molecular mechanisms by which SDH inhibition promotes post-MI
regeneration; 3) Determine the role of SDH inhibition by malonate on regenerative potential following myocardial
infarction in a porcine model. Our proposed experiments will define the mechanisms by which SDH inhibition
promotes cardiac regeneration, as well as establish the therapeutic potential of SDH inhibition in large animal
hearts which exhibit distinct physiology from the mouse heart. Collectively, our results reveal a novel role for
SDH inhibition in promoting heart regeneration following myocardial infarction, and this proposal will generate
important results that will lead to novel therapeutic strategies to regenerate the adult heart following infarction."
10767313,"Project Summary
 The over-arching goal of this proposal is to establish the predictive multi-scale mathematical model to decipher the
mechanism of durotaxis. Durotaxis is the preference of cells migrating toward a stiffer extracellular matrix (ECM) and has
important roles in many biological processes, ranging from embryo development to tumor metastasis. Focal adhesion (FA)
is the functional unit of durotaxis; it an integrin-based multi-protein transmembrane linkage, through which cell exerts actin
cytoskeleton-based traction force to tug the ECM and sense the stiffness. Despite the high relevance to biomedical
applications, it is not well understood how FA mediates mechanosensing of ECM stiffness and drives durotaxis, largely
because predictive mathematical models lag behind the descriptive experimental finding in the field. At single-FA level,
while previous models explain molecular-clutch behaviors in FA mechanosensing, they cannot explain how and why FA-
localized protein activities adapt to environments by distinctive spatial-temporal patterns (akin to footprints) that are
demonstrated to be essential for durotaxis. The full underlying mechanisms of the FA-localized “footprint” and its exact
roles in durotaxis are thus unknown. Further, durotaxis must coordinate movements of cell body and protrusion/retraction
of cell edge. While the FA-mediated tractions drive the cell body, how the FA-localized mechanosensing events coordinate
with the cell edge dynamics is unknown. Last, at a single-cell level, there exist many FAs at different developmental stages
at any time. It is not understood how the cell integrates the mechanosensing activities of individual FAs to drive durotaxis.
 A predictive model that meaningfully engages with experiments is desirable and likely holds the key to decipher
durotaxis. Toward this goal, we have been and will uniquely integrate mathematical modeling in iterative dialogues with
experimental testing. The central hypothesis is: FA-localized spatial-temporal dynamics of the traction force generation and
transmission defines FA-mediated mechanosensing and durotaxis. The basis of this proposal is our previous findings. We
built the first mathematical model that captures the essence of entire FA maturation process. That is, FA evolves from a
nascent complex, the centripetally growing FA that couples the retrograde flux of branching actin network, to the mature
FA that transmits the stress fiber (SF)-mediated contractions onto ECM. This model uniquely links the FA-localized fine
features of protein activities – emerging from FA maturation process – to FA mechanosensing events. The model predicted
and was experimentally confirmed that a negative feedback between the elongation and contractility of the FA-engaging SF
underlies the FA-localized traction oscillation and mechanosensing of ECM stiffness. Ushered by these findings, our
specific aims are to determine: 1) how FA force-transmission and SF elongation cross-talk in FA mechanosensing; 2) how
FA mechanosensing affects cell edge protrusion/retraction, and 3) how cell integrates mechanosensation of individual FAs
to drive durotaxis. If successful, the proposed research would provide a quantitative platform interpret data and guide
durotaxis experimental designs, which has the multi-scale resolutions ranging from FA-localized dynamics, cell edge
protrusion/retraction, to cell movement at whole-cell level."
10746849,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Cancer genome sequencing has identified thousands of somatic mutations in different types of human
cancer. These mutations provide a valuable source of information as to the potential mutagenic events
that have occurred and created the mutations, sometimes decades before the tumor develops. For certain
cancers, convincing links between an exposure and cancer mutations have been established, best
exemplified by typical sunlight-induced mutations (C to T mutations at dipyrimidine sequences) that are
prevalent in melanoma and in non-melanoma skin cancers and by smoking- related G to T transversion
mutations that are common in lung cancers from smokers but not nonsmokers. The types and frequencies of
mutations in different tumor types is called the mutational signature. Several signatures also have a
characteristic DNA strand bias related to, for example, the direction of transcription. In several human
cancers, there are unusual and characteristic mutational signatures of unknown origin. These signatures are
thought to arise from specific DNA damage, defective DNA repair or from endogenous processes. We
hypothesize that we can identify and recreate mutagenic signatures using DNA damage mapping, a
procedure in which we determine DNA lesions of a specific type at all sequence positions of the human
genome, combined with mutational analysis, with the goal of assigning mutational signatures to etiological
agents relevant for specific human cancers. One key challenge in this field is method development. The
method needs to be sufficiently sensitive to detect rare DNA lesions and must be capable of doing so at all
positions of the genome. We have developed such a method, which we named circle-damage-sequencing
(CD-seq). We propose three Specific Aims. In the first Aim, we will use our new method to characterize and
map reactive aldehyde-derived DNA adducts that we hypothesize play a crucial role in liver cancer. In the
second Aim, we will test the hypothesis that 8-oxo-dG incorporated from the nucleotide pool is responsible
for sequence-specific A to C transversion mutations observed as a dominant mutation type in human
esophageal adenocarcinomas. The last Aim will have the goal of understanding the mechanisms of targeted
mutagenesis by tobacco smoke carcinogens of the PAH class and how this targeting relates to lung and oral
squamous cell carcinomas in tobacco users. Our DNA damage studies will be complemented by mutation
assays to confirm that the relevant pathways induce the expected types of mutations. Our proposed work will
provide mechanistic insights into the potential origin of human cancer mutations. We anticipate that our
methods will aid in many future studies of DNA damage and repair and will help identify other mutagenic
mechanisms."

The long term goal of this project is to describe how the intricate structure of mammalian retina is made during
development. To achieve this goal, this proposal focuses on developing novel molecular recording
technologies that enable reconstruction of cell lineage and molecular history based on in situ endpoint
measurements. These methods leverage recent advances in genome editing technology to make targeted
mutations in synthetic barcode arrays that make a permanent and inheritable record of history of individual
cells in their genome. Importantly, the methods developed here are compatible with imaging based readout of
information and can be combined with in situ transcriptional profiling to provide a unified view of the current
state, past history, and spatial context of individual cells. By applying these methods, I will map the clonal
structure of the mouse retina, investigate the extent to which local signals affect cell fate decisions, reveal the
stochastic versus pre-programmed aspects of retinal lineage, and reconstruct the single cell trajectory of retinal
progenitor cells as they proceed through different competence states. Together, these experiments provide
fundamental new insight into cell fate specification process in mammalian retina and, therefore, will aid the
future efforts in regenerative medicine to remedy conditions in which misspecification or degeneration of retinal
neurons lead to blindness.
My career goal is to run an academic lab that studies how cells acquire and maintain different identities during
development, using molecular recording and synthetic biology approaches. The proposed experiments will
provide me with further training in retina biology, multiplexed sequential FISH technology, and single cell
genomics that are required for this goal. I have developed a detailed training plan with my mentor, Dr. Michael
Elowitz, to help me transition to independence. I will meet regularly with Dr. Elowitz to discuss research
progress, strategies for grant writing, student mentorship and lab management. To practice my mentorship
skills, I will oversee the work of a graduate student and a technician in the lab. To broaden my scientific
network, I will present my work at 2-3 international meetings per year. To seek out additional mentorship, in
areas critical to the success of this project, I will collaborate with and receive guidance from Dr. Connie Cepko,
expert in retina biology, Dr. Long Cai, pioneer in sequential FISH methods, and Dr. Jay Shendure, expert in
single cell genomics. As a member of Caltech Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, I will have
access to leaders in synthetic as well as developmental biology, cutting-edge courses and training programs,
and state-of-the-art core facilities. The Pathway to Independence Award will provide the time and resources
required to initiate an ambitious research program on the reconstruction of developmental history of

10763862,"The primary objective of the SAXS program at BioCAT is to provide the biomedical community access to
the small angle x-ray scattering instrument and to maintain the state-of-the-art. BioCAT has nurtured a user

support is provided 24/7 for onsite users, and BioCAT provides remote collaborations that involve a high
degree of beamline personnel participation. There are two broad categories of experiments performed under
the SAXS program: equilibrium and time-resolved SAXS. Liquid chromatography SAXS (LC-SAXS) constitutes
> 90% of the equilibrium SAXS program. LC-SAXS in combination with a coflow sample cell, based on a
design first adopted by the Australian SAXS beamline, has streamlined SAXS data acquisition at BioCAT by
nullifying common concerns such as sample heterogeneity and radiation damage induced capillary fouling.
Introduction of in-line multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detectors has
further enhanced the scope and quality of data acquired using our equilibrium SAXS instrument. As part of the
time-resolved SAXS program, three different options are available which cater to time regimes from ~80
microseconds to several seconds. The stopped-flow mixer or a laminar-flow mixer are recommended for
accessing time regimes between a millisecond and a few seconds, depending on the amount of sample
available and the system being studied. The chaotic flow mixer is used to access earlier time regimes (~ 80µs
to ~ 90 ms). Optimized fluid delivery systems, coordinated triggering mechanisms, and GUI based user-friendly
software tools developed in house have now made the continuous flow time-resolved SAXS instrument at
BioCAT one of its kind in the world and open to the general user community. BioCAT also maintains the widely
used open-source data analysis program BioXTAS RAW. Maintenance and upgrade plans cover improved
liquid chromatography systems, data analysis software, and microfluidic mixers, as well as upgraded
computing, data storage capabilities, network infrastructure, and detectors. We will fully optimize the
instrument to take advantage of the world class beam that will be provided by the APS-U project. Last but not
the least we will continue to increase automation for SAXS data acquisition in order to make the user as
independent as possible."

by the centralization of primary and processed data, models, workflows, and pipelines using a comprehensive

comprehensive workflows and quality control pipelines to ensure rigor and reproducibility of the data generated
throughout the SYBIL Consortium. Program data and resources will be disseminated through public repositories
and a Center website developed and maintained by the Core. The workflow of the DMBC has been optimized
and improved during the previous FluOMICS Consortium, through facilitating cooperation and the exchange of

An important goal of the DMBC will be the development of public tools that facilitate the use and reuse of data
generated by both the SYBIL program and the broader scientific community. The availability of systems-level
data in the infectious disease field has grown to unprecedented levels in recent years, particularly during the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to a lack of accessible and easy-to-use tools that provide
consolidated access and perform meta-analyses of large-scale datasets, the vast potential for infectious disease
OMICs datasets to inform design and development of new therapeutic strategies likely remains unrealized. To
help overcome this barrier, the DMBC plans to establish Coronascape, a new tool that enables researchers to
match the network and pathway signatures of their experiments to publicly available host-pathogen data sets
and leverage those data to overcome emerging challenges of an advancing field. Building on the highly
successful Metascape platform previously developed by the DMBC, Coronascape promises to promote the
utilization and reuse of the vast amounts of SARS-CoV-2 data that are publicly available."
10758540,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to different clinical outcomes that range from mild symptoms to
hospitalization and sometimes death. However, biomarkers predictive of COVID-10 disease outcomes
(i.e., symptoms severity, viral replication), which are key for preventive medicine, have not yet been
identified. Importantly, elucidation of the molecular components that govern predictive signatures of
clinical outcomes will provide important clues that will guide the development of novel therapeutic
strategies. This U19 will build on a wealth of data gathered by the previous FluOMICS next-generation
scientist and pursue two converging hypotheses 1) host innate immune response pathways triggered
by SARS-CoV-2 infection determine the pathogenic outcome of COVID-19 disease 2) the crosstalk
between SARS-CoV-2 variants and these host innate pathways results in different transcriptional and
post-translational signatures contributing to the difference in disease severity and host-tropism of the
viruses. The primary objective of the Modeling Core will be to use network-based modeling approaches
to integrate the experimental data generated by Project 1 and Project 2, identify innate biological
processes that can predict COVID-19 disease outcomes and validate them functionally in collaboration
with Project 1 and Project 2. In Aim 1, the Modeling Core will integrate OMIC datasets generated in
Project 1 from data from Human in vivo and mice in vivo studies and processed and analyzed by the
Technology Core and the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. The Modeling core will build host
response network models that depict the viral-host interaction at play in early events of COVID-19
infection and disease, i.e., viral replication, escape from the host innate immune response in natural
infection and upon vaccination and triggering of the deleterious pro-inflammatory immune response. In
Aim 2, the Modeling Core will apply heuristic approaches and an iterative process with Project 1 and
Project 2. This approach will help identify novel pathways downstream of host-pathogen interactions.
Importantly, it will guide the implementation of gene editing of these genes and pathways in Project 2
to validate these models and improve their accuracy experimentally; It will help understand how SARS-
CoV-2 variants affect the viral-host networks built-in Aim 1. In Aim 3, the Modeling Core will use
experimentally identified 3D structures of viral-host interactions and an artificial intelligence model,
AlphaFold, to identify virus-host interaction in the bat, the natural host of the coronaviruses, and
compare them to interactions in humans to study host-tropism of the virus and infer how these changes
could impact on the pathogenic outcome of the infection. Altogether the Modeling core will provide a
platform that will guide the identification and experimental validation of novel druggable targets that can
stop the spread of the virus in infected hosts and worldwide populations."
10758545,"Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections are still responsible for huge economic
losses, lockdowns and stressed health care systems worldwide. Different from the situation early during the
pandemic, when the virus started circulating in the human population in the absence of pre-existing immunity,
SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity has been increased at the community level due to vaccination or previous
infection. Nevertheless, through the acquisition of mutations, new variants of the virus emerged that were able
to escape pre-existing immunity and to transmit with higher efficiency, thereby causing a continuous threat for
severe disease, especially in people with comorbidities like obesity, advanced age and associated morbidities
like type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In Project 1, we will identify key drivers and biomarkers for severe
disease networks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection through modeling, based on multi-OMICs data
obtained from clinical and animal studies. Under AIM 1, a first dataset will be generated from clinical
samples of COVID-19 patients in the absence or presence of pre-existing immunity. Multi-OMICs data will also
be generated using established animal models (mouse and hamster) for SARS-CoV-2 infection to recapitulate
clinical characteristics and features from the human cohort studies, thereby taking advantage of our expertise
with animal models for specific comorbidities (obesity, type 2 diabetes, advanced age) while always addressing
sex and immune status as a biological variables. Both human and animal datasets will be used by the
modeling core under AIM 2 to identify networks associated with severe and mild disease outcome, and the
host and virus genes that drive them. Under AIM 3, networks and signature genes identified under AIM 2 will
be validated in vivo using the mouse and hamster infection models for SARS-CoV-1. Hereto, we will rely on the
availability of knock out mice, viral vector-mediated genetic ablation of host genes in cells licensed for SARS-
CoV infection, when available pharmacological interventions, recombinant rSARS-CoV-1 and rSARS-CoV-2
viruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants that have acquired mutations in genes of interest by nature. The

distinct disease trajectories and outcomes, identifying novel targets for therapeutic interventions."
10758552,"PROJECT 2: Ex Vivo Analysis of Coronavirus Tropism, Adaptation, Replication, and Host Response
 In this proposal, we hypothesize that multiple and discrete virus-host interactions and host responses to
infection dictate the pathogenic outcome and host tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We further hypothesize that these
critical circuits can be dissected through network-based modeling of system-level measurements offering the
potential for the development of novel antiviral therapies. In Project 2, we propose to utilize leading edge OMICs-
based measurements to define virus-host interactions and networks that control viral replication, viral
tropism/adaptation and host responses across bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 variants. In
Aim 1, we will conduct proteomics (AP-MS, protein abundance and post-translational modifications),
transcriptomics (RNA-seq and scRNA-seq), epigenomics (ATAC-seq, Hi-C and ChiP-seq) and genetic and
chemical compound screens using ex vivo primary epithelial cells and iPSC-derived pneumocytes derived both
from human and bats and a lung epithelial cell line (A549). In Aim 2, these data will be integrated and modeled
with in vivo and clinical data collected in Project 1 using network-based predictive modeling approaches to
identify host proteins, networks, and pathways that correlate with disease severity and host adaptation (‘driver
genes’). Reiterative modeling of data generated in Aim 1 and Project 1 will be employed to refine these
predictions. In Aim 3, CRISPR-editing approaches will be used in concert with targeted OMICs measurements
(CRISPR-OMICs), including transcriptional, epigenetic, proteomic analyses, to validate the impact of these
‘driver genes’ on disease outcome and host tropism. Additional molecular, cellular, biochemical, and in vivo
studies will be conducted to further characterize nodes that determine disease outcome as potential therapeutic
targets. Overall, these studies will enable us to correlate in vivo and clinical biomarkers predictive of COVID-19
severity (Project 1) to specific genes and networks that impact viral infection, cellular host responses, and
interspecies transmission."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, affecting millions of elderly patients in our aging
society, and thus represents a severe health care challenge. Currently available drugs may provide some
temporary relief but none of them is able to halt disease progression or cure. To develop better therapies a
clear understanding of the disease etiology is urgently needed. Recent data suggest the rate of synaptic
activity and particularly rate of vesicle endocytosis is critically important for the processing of amyloid precursor
protein (APP) into beta-amyloid (Abeta), a source of major toxic component in AD. The exact molecular
mechanism connecting synaptic transmission to APP processing is still unknown. My laboratory’s long-term
goal is to identify new, molecular therapeutic target(s) in the brain that can help to prevent synaptic dysfunction
and neurodegeneration to preserve cognition and memory. The objective in this application is to examine a
specific class of proteins – the vesicular membrane associated proteins (VAMPs/synaptobrevins) and their role
in synaptic release and Abeta production. Our strong preliminary results establish synaptobrevin1/VAMP1
(syb1), a member of the SNARE (SNAP Receptor) complex, as a novel object for this innovative research of
dementia: a) in human genetic screens single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants of the VAMP1 gene
encoding syb1 are significantly associated with late onset AD; b) SNPs associated with increased expression
of VAMP1 increase the risk of AD and SNPs associated with lower VAMP1 expression reduces the risk of AD;
c) in the new VAMP1 KO mice endogenous Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels are substantially reduced. Based on
these observations, the central hypothesis is that VAMP1 is a key coupling protein between vesicular release
and APP processing. We hypothesize that variations in VAMP1 level alter the coupling of synaptic
transmission to APP processing and therefore have profound effect on Abeta production. The rationale for the
proposed research is that understanding the molecular mechanism that activates Abeta production will provide
a novel, better way to lower Abeta levels and it may prevent or delay cognitive decline in AD patients. We will
test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Examine the effect of synaptobrevin expression level on
synaptic activity and Abeta production in neurons using the novel VAMP1 KO mice. 2) Identify the structural
elements of VAMP1 coupling synaptic activity to amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing. 3) Evaluate the
effects of reduced VAMP1 levels on preventing cognitive impairment in the AD model Tg2576 mice in vivo.
These aims will be tested through extensive analysis of synaptic activity, endocytosis and Abeta production
with sophisticated methods including multi-electrode and patch-clamp electrophysiology and live fluorescence
microscopy. The proposed research is significant because it has the potential to identify VAMP1 as the first
synaptic regulator of amyloidogenesis and novel target for AD diagnosis and therapy."

The long-term objective of the PI's research program is to discover and understand general principles of
evolution in terms of molecular genetic mechanisms and driving forces. This is a rapidly progressing area,
thanks to the technological revolution in molecular biology and genomics, rapid accumulation of genome
sequences and functional genomic data, and most importantly, conceptual developments in various fields of
biology. Genomic and systemic approaches to evolution are especially valuable, because the genomic
approach allows assessing the generalities and relative contributions of individual mechanisms discovered and
the systemic approach helps refocus the study of evolutionary processes from roles of individual
genes/mutations to those of interactions among genes/mutations (and the environment), which are key to
uncovering the inner workings and evolution of biological systems. The PI's lab studies evolutionary
mechanisms from genomic and systemic perspectives using multiple model systems (mostly yeast and
mammals) and a combination of theoretical modeling, computer simulation, integrative data analysis,
laboratory experimental evolution, and molecular and genomic experimentation. This proposal centers on two
related themes that are of fundamental importance to evolution: epistasis and pleiotropy. On the topic of
epistasis, the PI and his team will characterize patterns of intragenic and intergenic epistasis by mapping
fitness landscapes of representative genes and joint fitness landscapes of pairs of interacting genes, study the
genetic background dependency of gene essentiality at the genomic scale, experimentally test the hypothesis
that the existence and persistence of RNA editing is explained by evolutionary entrenchment, and attempt to
resolve the apparently contradictory inferences of epistasis patterns from adaptive evolution and mutation
accumulation. On the topic of pleiotropy, the PI and his team will map multi-environment fitness landscapes of
representative genes to study general patterns of environmental pleiotropy of mutations, identify common loci
of environmental adaptations, quantify the influence of pleiotropy on molecular adaptations in changing
environments, and assess the impact of pleiotropy on the rate of phenotypic evolution and human aging and
disease. Together, these projects promise to deepen the understanding of the genetic mechanisms and driving
forces of evolution and shed light on disease mechanisms and prevalence."

As of January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 89 million cases of COVID-19 (SARS-
CoV-2) have been confirmed and have resulted in more than 1.9 million deaths globally. Currently, the United
States (U.S.) is the country with the largest number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19, with a total of
22 million infections and 373,167 deaths. Furthermore, early findings that have examined COVID-19
demographics show that racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. are bearing a disproportionate number of
COVID-19 cases and deaths irrespective of geographic region. While there's no evidence that people of color
(POC) have genetic or biological factors that make them more likely to be affected by COVID-19, they are
more likely to have underlying health conditions, live in multi-generational homes, live in densely populated
areas, have limited access to healthcare, and have jobs that are considered essential and involve interaction
with the public. All of these factors contribute to higher rates of infection and adverse outcomes due to COVID-19. Although COVID-19 preventive behaviors such as hand washing, mask wearing, and social distancing
have been shown to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus, acceptance and uptake of COVID-19
vaccines will be instrumental to ending the pandemic. However, public confidence in vaccination is fragile,
especially among racial and ethnic minorities. To this end, we have formed an intervention working group
comprised of representatives from community and academic organizations to address challenges in COVID-19
vaccination uptake among Latinx and African American (AA) communities in Southern California by using a
community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. Project 2VIDA! (SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Intervention
Delivery for Adults in Southern California), is a multilevel intervention to address individual, social, and
contextual factors related to access to, and acceptance of, the COVID-19 vaccine among Latinx and AA adults
(>18 years old) across six highly affected communities in Southeast San Diego. 2VIDA! seeks to implement
and assess a COVID-19 vaccination protocol to increase interest and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine, provide
COVID-19 vaccines in the community, and establish a model for the rapid vaccination of Latino and AA adults
that could be generalizable to other highly affected communities. 2VIDA! builds on our previous CBPR efforts
and centers on conducting COVID-19 community outreach and health promotion, Individual awareness and
education, and linkages to medical and supportive services and offering the COVID-19 vaccine to Latinx and
AA adults (>18 years old) in community health centers (CHC) and mini-vaccination stations in communities
highly impacted by the pandemic in San Diego County."

The mechanisms by which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) niche is affected by clonal
hematological disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the
heterogeneity and clonal response of endothelial and stromal cells (the main components of the HSPC niche) in
MDS in vivo remain unexplored. To tackle these aspects, I developed a new zebrafish model of MDS by driving
the protooncogene CMYC overexpression specifically in blood cells. Additionally, I crossed a genetic lineage
tracing zebrafish line called GESTALT to a double transgenic zebrafish line carrying two fluorescent reporters
allowing to purify specifically niche endothelial and stromal cells. This way, I created a new GESTALT line that
permits CRISPR-CAS9 based barcoding during zebrafish embryonic development, purification of adult marrow
niche cells and recovery of niche DNA barcodes by sequencing. Combining these novel tools, I induced MDS in
barcoded zebrafish and read out the clonality and the transcriptome of endothelial and stromal cells. I discovered
that clones of stromal cells selectively expand, and endothelial cells are transcriptionally remodeled in MDS.
Given these data, I hypothesize that MDS remodels the clonality and transcriptional profile of the HSPC
niche and that mechanisms involved in HSPC-niche interactions promote disease progression. Under
the mentorship of Dr. Leonard Zon, I will investigate the mechanisms by which MDS remodels the niche using a
combination of in silico computational approaches, genetic (GESTALT) and color based (Zebrabow) lineage
tracing, confocal microscopy and in vivo mosaic mutagenesis. Once I establish my laboratory, I will build a
multidisciplinary team to deepen my computational analyses and broaden my in vivo genetic and biochemical
perturbations of the clonal mechanisms of niche involvement in MDS. My overarching goal is to identify novel
targetable mechanisms specific to the HSPC niche that would prevent and/or halt MDS progression. This
K99/R00 award will enable me to develop new technical skills, participate in courses that will improve my ability
to manage a laboratory, and attend conferences that will broaden my network and my knowledge of
hematological disease modeling, Zebrabow lineage tracing paired with confocal microscopy and zebrafish
mutagenesis. The scientific advisory committee I have put together includes experts in the fields of
hematopoiesis, lineage tracing, and stem cell biology and, along with Dr. Zon, will give me feedback on my
research and career progress. These proposed research and career development activities will pave the way for
me to become an independent investigator discovering and studying new mechanisms responsible for
hematopoietic disorders progression mediated by the blood stem cell niche."
10927185,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: OVERALL COBRE on Implementation Science & Equity
Shrinking the time lag for translating research evidence into clinical practice would improve health outcomes
across multiple domains and reduce costs to society. Until recently, however, clinical research has devoted
little attention to implementing evidence-based practices in real-world clinical care. Moreover, rural, minority,
and other subpopulations experience even greater gaps in health care quality. Implementation Science is an
emerging field of research that specifically focuses on identifying the best approaches to integrating evidence-
based practices into routine clinical care. Our proposal for a Phase I Center of Biomedical Research
Excellence (COBRE) on Implementation Science and Equity seeks to establish a research center at the
University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). This COBRE will develop and test Implementation Science
approaches designed to achieve equitable care for rural, minority, and other underserved populations.
The goal of this multidisciplinary research center in an Institutional Development Award (IDeA) state is to
develop sustainable and generalizable approaches to reducing inequities in care. The Administrative Core
includes an internal advisory committee, an external advisory committee, strong institutional support, and
substantial financial and in-kind contributions from all schools and major centers across KUMC. The proposed
COBRE will consist of three research cores, which will provide unique services for building institutional
capacity in implementation science and will mentor five promising junior project leaders. Our overall specific
aims are to:
Aim 1. Create and sustain an organizational structure to provide scientific mentoring and institutional
support for implementation science and equity at KUMC.
Aim 2. Provide core infrastructure in methodology, engagement, and ethical issues in research with
human subjects, to support implementation research conducted by Project Leaders and the broader
KUMC community.
Aim 3. Select and train outstanding, multi-disciplinary, senior and early-career faculty who will develop
implementation science approaches for delivering high-quality care to underserved groups.
The proposed COBRE will advance the field of implementation science by creating approaches to identifying
inequities, diagnosing causes, and testing solutions. Implementation Science and Equity COBRE leads, Drs.
Kimber Richter and Christie Befort have strong track records in leadership, administration, and mentoring in
implementation science—especially with minority investigators—to achieve research independence. Taken
together, the proposed COBRE will create a sustainable and growth-oriented program in implementation
science that will have local, national, and international impact."
10927187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT & OUTREACH (CEO) CORE
Engaging with patients, families, caregivers, neighborhoods, and communities is an essential feature of
implementation research. Meaningful engagement requires trust, which comes from sustained collaboration
over time. In the case of rural research, substantial distances between researchers and stakeholders create
even more serious barriers to meaningful engagement. In addition, culturally competent approaches—informed
through partnerships with those individuals and communities experiencing inequities—are essential for making
a meaningful impact on population health. The vision for the CEO Core is to offer a comprehensive suite of
educational opportunities and facilitating services that accelerate stakeholder engagement for researchers to
achieve maximal engagement effectiveness. The specific aims of the CEO Core are to:
Aim 1. Orient investigators to equity research and community engagement frameworks and create
engagement plans to support implementation research that is focused on equity. The CEO Core team
will guide Project Leads in the development of an engagement plan, adapted from the PCORI Engagement
Plan Template. The CEO Core team will meet with Project Leads on a quarterly basis to review engagement
plans and benchmarks, share lessons learned, and troubleshoot barriers.
Aim 2. Provide comprehensive community engagement services for COBRE projects and the broader
research community that successfully reaches populations experiencing health disparities. The CEO
will link COBRE investigators with organizations and community-engaged professionals across Kansas that
can facilitate culturally informed and competent engagement. Based on the engagement plan, the CEO will link
investigators and their community partners using services and trainings to meet benchmarks for engagement.
Aim 3. Support dissemination of research project findings and methods for pursuing equity through
community engagement. The CEO will support on-going engagement that ultimately will lead to breadth and
depth of dissemination of research findings to stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, organizations,
societies, and policy makers.
Aim 4. Collaborate with the Administrative Core to evaluate CEO effectiveness. The Core will collect
ongoing data to evaluate and improve services. In addition, the Core will collect data from Project Leads and
pilot project awardees on community engagement activities in real time via the Community Check Box
Evaluation System."
10927189,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PRAGMATIC IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE METHODS (PrISM) CORE
Regardless of their research training or inherent talent, the learning curve for new investigators in
implementation science can be steep. The PrISM Core will provide COBRE and other KUMC investigators the
coordinated, interdisciplinary support that is critical to success in this complex field. PrISM’s ‘team science’
approach will increase the likelihood of successful execution of research projects and better prepare Project
Leads for working in the collaborative research environment that is critical to implementation science.
Aim 1. Establish an Implementation Science methods Core bringing together expertise in implementation
science theory and methods and leveraging the principles of team science to seamlessly integrate expertise in
biostatistics, medical informatics, mixed methods research, and health equity research. The PrISM Core will
work closely with the CEO core to provide researchers with access to research sites and clinical data needed
to support pragmatic implementation research that advances health equity.
Aim 2. Support COBRE Project Leads in project conceptualization, design, execution, and analysis,
and plans for future research. We will use an adaptation of Proctor’s classic model of implementation
research to create a framework for supporting Project Leads through each step of equity-focused
implementation research, including: describing existing disparities in treatment, developing implementation
strategies, analyzing outcomes, reporting results, and designing new, innovative research proposals to extend
or disseminate findings from COBRE-supported work.
Aim 3. Foster new applications and implementation science methods to address health equity. PrISM
will work with the Administrative Core to identify and support new investigators and advance implementation
science methods, including methods that address unique issues in rural, minority and other underserved
communities. PrISM will also continually scan the field to identify critical gaps in equity-focused
implementation research in order to help prioritize COBRE efforts.
Aim 4. Collaborate with the Administrative Core to evaluate PrISM performance. The PrISM core
addresses a previously unmet need at the University of Kansas Medical Center for an integrated team focused
on implementation science. The PrISM Core will increase institutional and regional capacity to conduct high
quality implementation research, will make research projects more pragmatic, and as a result will increase the
COBRE’s potential for sustained and widespread impact on the field."

Increased levels of air pollution from wildfires are directly associated with asthma exacerbations but
the mechanisms mediating this association are not understood. Furthermore, the severity of asthma
symptoms that result from wildfire exposure vary considerably by individual. We seek to identify
Transcriptional Regulatory Elements (TREs) that connect wildfire particulate exposures with genetic
variants associated with asthma to identify susceptibility features and mechanisms that govern asthma
exacerbations.
We will employ wood smoke particle (WSP) exposure in primary airway epithelial cells cultured at air-
liquid interface to model the interaction between the respiratory epithelium and fine particulates
released by wildfires. We will assay chromatin accessibility and nascent transcription using next-
generation sequencing techniques to identify TREs regulated by WSP. Then, using a permutation-
based bioinformatic approach, we will intersect the genomic coordinates of these TREs with genomic
susceptibility loci for asthma. We will then characterize the transcriptional function of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that result from this intersection. We will test TRE function in the context of
WSP exposure with and without the SNPs in plasmid-derived luciferase reporters and in genomic
DNA, using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) – Cas9 tool to
introduce the variant alleles. Finally, to assay the physiologic significance of these TRE-SNP overlaps,
we will test the role of the rs258760 SNP, which inhabits a TRE under regulation by WSP and controls
expression of the glucocorticoid receptor, in mediating Interleukin-8 secretion by exposing airway
epithelial cells from donors with the major and minor alleles to WSP and dexamethasone.
This project will identify and characterize genomic features that connect air pollution with asthma
exacerbations. These loci and the genes they regulate will serve as candidates for pharmacologic
therapies to mitigate asthma symptoms associated with wildfire air pollution. Furthermore, this
project develops a method to integrate multiple models of disease in a genomic context. This
strategy may be used to propose novel treatments for asthma."

Volumetric muscle loss (VML) usually occurs following traumatic injury and results in a composite loss of
muscle mass. These injuries manifest in decreased strength and functional impairments. Clinically, these
injuries often heal with fibrosis, as opposed to skeletal muscle regeneration. Current existing therapeutic
options are also insufficient for VML treatment, and complications are often associated with surgical repair
including nerve injury, excessive immune response, infection, scarring, and limitations of tissue graft supply.
Indeed, natural healing and surgical procedures are inefficient in restoring the functionality of injured muscles,
resulting in a poor quality of life. Therefore, developing clinically relevant three-dimensional (3D) tissue using
patient-specific genetically identical cells has emerged as a potential solution to address the above issues. To
achieve this aim, there are two existing main challenges. The first challenge is obtaining large amounts of
patient-specific genetically identical cells. The use of human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiated to
the muscle lineage represents a promising candidate to build upon personalized therapy. However, directing
the differentiation of hiPSCs to the muscle fate along with reproducible differentiation schemes has proven to
be challenging. The second challenge is developing a highly organized and vascularized 3D skeletal muscle
tissue to maintain the viability of cells inside thick tissue constructs via engineered vessel networks.
Furthermore, the fabricated tissues have to strongly integrate into injured site via surgical methods. To address
these challenges, we plan to develop a suturable 3D vascularized muscle tissue from hiPSC-derived myogenic
precursor cells (hiPSC-MPCs) embedded in biomaterials using bioprinting techniques. We will optimize the
recently developed protocols allowing efficient production of functional myofibers from hiPSCs in hydrogels
with tunable mechanical properties and degradable profiles, which mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) of
native skeletal muscle tissue. To create biomimetic vascularized muscle constructs, a multi-material embedded
bioprinting technique will be used to precisely control the positions of the vascular network and aligned muscle
fibers with biologically relevant architectures. With the conventional bioprinting system, it is difficult to precisely
control the materials’ position in Z directions to create freestanding hydrogel architectures. Also, to achieve
prolonged retention of implants into the injured site and to improve muscle regeneration, a muscle growth
factor (IGF-1) laden suturable graft will be developed. hiPSC-MPCs-laden constructs will be printed on the
suturable graft consisting of IGF-1-laden PGS/GelMA substrates using electrospinning."

The proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award launches a line of work
aiming to comprehensively target mechanisms of avoidance in anxiety and other disorders; and, it provides Dr.
Christopher Sege with skills necessary to becoming a leading clinical researcher. Dr. Sege’s primary clinical
research career goal is to use cutting-edge translational science to improve mental health care by targeting
precise disorder mechanisms. Need for this research is significant and consistent with NIMH priorities and the
RDoC framework. Avoidance is a core target of anxiety and related disorder treatment, but avoidant behaviors
often persist after symptom reduction and keep many from engaging in treatment at all. Novel methods to
target multiple motive drivers of avoidance early in treatment are needed to improve retention and outcome
especially for the 20% of individuals who do not benefit from and 40% who do not complete treatment. Basic
science provides critical clues as to the multiple mechanisms of real-world avoidance that may be indirectly or
inadequately addressed by current treatment techniques. Crucial goals of work proposed here is to determine
how these mechanisms drive clinical behavior and support subsequent work that develops direct intervention
tools. The proposed project uses direct neurostimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; rTMS) in
concert with precise experimental methods to test how specific reactive (escape) and proactive (avoidance)
coping neurocircuits can be modulated to alter downstream fear and approach-avoid decision-making.
Subsequent R-level applications build on this work to determine coping profiles of treatment completers versus
non-completers, and to test how profiles can be more precisely targeted to improve outcomes. A team of
expert mentors (George, Liu, McTeague, Mobbs, Uhde) will use their extensive knowledge in research-based
and clinical neurostimulation, advanced fMRI analysis and research methods, and creation of translational
science-informed treatment adjuvants to support Dr. Sege in his development. Mentorship, hands-on research
tutorials, coursework, seminars/ workshops, and international conference attendance afforded by the K23 will
ensure that Dr. Sege achieves his career goals to: 1) develop expertise in cutting-edge neurostimulation for
research and clinical use, 2) develop expertise in fMRI analysis and research tools for use in concert with
rTMS to more precisely target ecologically-relevant avoidance behavior, and; 3) develop expertise in creating
adjuvants that improve cognitive behavior therapy outcomes through application of translational science. The
proposed K23 will also foster development in areas of publication, grant writing, and inter-departmental
collaboration, all at an institution – the Medical University of South Carolina – which has a strong track record
and commitment to early stage investigators. Proposed K23 activities will prepare Dr. Sege to become a
cutting-edge clinical researcher and a leader in the development of a precision medicine of psychiatry."
10815867,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Perinatal depression affects 6.5%-12.9% of mothers, with comorbid perinatal anxiety occurring in as many as
50% of cases. In low-income people of color, rates of these perinatal affective disorders (PNAD) are even higher.
PNAD are associated with adverse effects on both maternal and infant health and can contribute to preterm birth
and low birth weight. It is important to further our understanding of the etiology of PNAD to more efficaciously
identify and treat patients, especially in at-risk populations. Levels of progesterone, and its metabolites
allopregnanolone (ALLO) and pregnanolone (PA) fluctuate drastically during pregnancy and have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of PNAD. These neuroactive steroids (NAS) act via the inhibitory GABAA
receptors to alter neural circuitry and modulate affective symptoms. Postpartum withdrawal from NAS provokes
affective symptoms and modifies GABAA receptor subunit expression. Our initial published work suggests that
acute surges in NAS early in pregnancy (1st and 2nd trimesters) are also associated with affective symptoms in
low-income perinatal people of color. To our knowledge PNAD symptoms have not been studied in relation to
NAS withdrawal and surges in the same cohort. Further, our preclinical work links acute alterations in NAS to
changes in the composition of the α4, γ2, and δ GABAA receptor subunit expression, but this work has not been
translated to humans. We have developed methods to measure GABAA receptor subunit expression in peripheral
mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). We propose to recruit 50 pregnant participants from MoMent, a longstanding
cohort comprised primarily of racial and ethnic minorities. We will measure NAS (ALLO and PA), GABAA receptor
subunit expression (α4, γ2, and δ) and affective symptoms (depression and anxiety) at four time points, once
per trimester and postpartum. Overall, we hypothesize that protracted stress common in PNAD, particularly in
people of color, may lead to exaggerated perinatal changes in NAS (Aim 1) and insufficient adaptation of
GABAAR subunits (Aim 2) contributing to high rates of PNAD. These mechanisms can occur independently or
interactively such that in some individuals, the dramatic increases in or withdrawal from NAS in the perinatal
period contribute to PNAD symptoms, especially when GABAAR do not functionally adapt to NAS. The specific
aims are to investigate (1) the association between the rate of specific perinatal NAS changes (early-pregnancy
surges, postpartum withdrawal) and affective symptoms; and (2) the association between degree of dynamic
perinatal changes in GABAA receptor subunit expression and affective symptoms, as well as to explore the
interactive effects of these two factors. By studying affective symptoms in relation to both rate of NAS
surges/withdrawal and GABAA receptor subunit expression in the same at-risk perinatal cohort, this study will
have a meaningful impact on our understanding of PNAD pathogenesis. Findings will ultimately contribute to
efforts to improve prediction, detection, and personalized treatment of PNAD symptoms – particularly in low-
income people of color who have high rates of PNAD but are under-diagnosed and under-treated."
10739813,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a complex human delta retrovirus that infects 10-20 million people worldwide. Approximately 3-5% of infected individuals develop an intractable T cell malignancy known as adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) decades later. How HTLV-1 infection progresses to ATL is not fully understood. Two viral regulatory proteins, Tax and HBZ, encoded by the sense and antisense viral mRNA transcripts, respectively, are crucial for causing ATL. Tax, the viral trans-activator/oncoprotein, is a robust activator of viral replication and IKK/NF-κB signaling, and a potent clastogen that induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It is thought to be the cause for the extensive genomic instability of ATL, which, on average, contains 59.5 structural variations in its genome. We recently discovered that NF-κB hyperactivation by Tax results in the co-transcriptional accumulation of a nucleic acid structure known as an R-loop. And R-loop excision by Xeroderma pigmentosum F (XPF) and XPG, two endonucleases of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway, leads to DNA DSBs. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the genomic instability of ATL and the senescence-inducing activities of Tax. Indeed, NF-κB blockade prevents Tax- induced R-loop accumulation, DNA damage, and senescence. And the silencing of XPF and XPG mitigates Tax senescence, while deficiency in either or both frequently occurs in ATL cells of all types. Importantly, NF-κB is constitutively active in ATL, and ATL cells are resistant to Tax-senescence, suggesting that they have evolved adaptive changes to benefit from the survival and proliferation advantages conferred by Tax and NF-κB. Considering our discoveries outlined above and recent evidence showing that Tax is expressed intermittently in intense bursts in ATL cell lines and HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes cultured ex vivo, we posit that most de novo HTLV-1 infections result in active viral replication, during which potent NF-κB activation by Tax drives the accumulation of R-loops that promote DNA DSBs, leading to senescence. In a fraction of infected T cells, HTLV- 1 proviruses likely integrate into transcriptionally quiescent chromosomal regions, establishing latent viral infection. During latency, HBZ, expressed from a distinct promoter in the 3’ LTR, dampens Tax activities to inhibit viral replication and, at the same time, stimulates the clonal expansion of the latently infected cells. We further posit that Tax, expressed intermittently during viral reactivation, targets R-loops and DNA DSBs to specific NF- kB-regulated genes, causing their inactivation and facilitating ATL development. Finally, we hypothesize that during ATL evolution, gain-of-function mutations and copy number variants of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) gene are selected to enable cellular adaptation to the DNA damage and senescence response induced by Tax and NF-κB. We will test these hypotheses in two specific aims: Aim 1 To determine how Tax/NF-κB - induced R-loops impact host cell genome and cell fate. Aim 2 To elucidate how ATL cells accommodate chronic NF-κB activation."

Fulfilling the promise of modern systems biology and grasping the underlying complexity of biological systems
requires a foundation built upon the development of high-throughput functional genomic approaches capable of
generating large datasets. Large scale sequencing efforts reveal correlations, but lacks causal interactions
best provided via genetic approaches. Caenorhabditis elegans has been a workhorse for gene discovery and
pathway analysis, and is the only established system where high-throughput genetic analysis can be
conducted in the context of a living multi-cellular organism (i.e. feeding based RNAi). Despite the power of this
model system, no high-throughput methods to achieve targeted gene overexpression in C. elegans have been
developed. This project will explore how recombinant strains of two different viruses can be adapted as vectors
to enable large-scale genetic analysis of gene overexpression in C. elegans. The objective of Specific Aim 1 is
to achieve promoter-specific gene activation using CRISPRa. This variant form of CRISPR relies on a
cleavage defective isoform of Cas9 (dCas9) fused with a transcriptional activator to drive overexpression of a
gene targeted by the single gene RNA (sgRNA). Specifically, we propose to generate proof-of-principle
evidence that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) can deliver a sgRNA into transgenic C. elegans
that express the CRISPRa machinery in intestinal cells to induce sgRNA-directed overexpression of a reporter
gene. Ultimately our goal is to develop a comprehensive sgRNA VSV library directed to promoter regions to
allow high-throughput functional genomic screening in C. elegans. The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to develop
Orsay virus (OV) as a vector to deliver functional mRNA exogenously into C. elegans. The use of OV as a
gene delivery system is straightforward as this virus readily enters the animal via the intestinal lumen, and C.
elegans expressing integrated segments of the OV genome have been validated. Briefly, we will use these
existing strains as “packaging lines” to express C. elegans genes of interest capable of being incorporated in
newly generated virion to infect recipient nematodes. These studies represent an initial step towards the use of
OV as an overexpression vector and would accelerate the development large-scale genetic analysis in this
multicellular organism. These viral-based expression tools would integrate easily with existing approaches
widely used by the C. elegans community, which could potentially transform multiple areas of scientific
investigation, and has implications for understanding of many diseases."

Proposed is a sleep monitoring system specifically designed for care providers of persons with Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) to monitor sleep disturbances and trends.
Significance: Studies indicate that approximately 1 in 3 patients with AD/ADRD suffer from sleep and other
nighttime disturbances such as insomnia and disruption of sleep, wandering, day/night confusion, repeatedly
leaving bed, nightmares, and hallucinations. Sleep disturbances often lead to reduced health and lower quality
of life for persons with AD/ADRD and in Long Term Care (LTC) settings place burden on staff. Nearly half of all
people in LTC settings have a diagnosis of AD/ADRD. Unfortunately, clinical providers and staff in LTCs are
limited in their ability to identify and treat these conditions as current methods of sleep quality assessment are
either inaccurate, time consuming, or inappropriate for use with those who have AD/ADRD. Hypothesis: We
hypothesize that a system which allows for practical, long-term monitoring of sleep quality metrics for patients
with AD/ADRD will lead to greater documentation of sleep problems, greater prescribing of appropriate
nonpharmacological treatment, and improvements in sleep quality and daytime inactivity. Specific Aims: To
transition the Phase I prototype to a production ready product and evaluate the efficacy of the system in Phase
II IDL will 1) Create production-ready system with updated hardware, firmware, and mechanical design 2)

10773036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autophagy is a tightly regulated intracellular degradation and recycling process crucial for cellular homeostasis
and adaptation to diverse cancer-relevant stresses. Because autophagy promotes the survival and metabolic
fitness of established tumors, there is great interest in targeting autophagy to treat cancer. Importantly, anti-
malarials, such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being repurposed as autophagy inhibitors in clinical
oncology trials. However, inhibiting autophagy also results in aberrant accumulation of autophagy cargo
receptors (ACRs), adaptor proteins that mediate the selective autophagic degradation of targets as well as
function as multidomain signaling hubs. The accumulation of ACRs supports oncogenic progression, drives
primary tumor growth and promotes therapeutic resistance in autophagy-deficient cells, but the role of ACRs
during metastasis has been less clear. In recently published data, we have demonstrated that the accumulation
of a specific ACR, called neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1), promotes metastasis when autophagy is inhibited in tumor
cells. In mouse mammary cancer models, genetic autophagy inhibition promotes spontaneous metastasis by
enabling the outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells into overt macro-metastases. Furthermore, at both primary
and metastatic sites, genetic autophagy inhibition leads to the marked expansion of tumor cells exhibiting
aggressive and pro-metastatic basal epithelial differentiation, including the expression of cytokeratin 14 (CK14)
and the transcription factor p63. The upregulation of NBR1 in autophagy-deficient tumors is both necessary and
sufficient to promote metastatic outgrowth and pro-metastatic differentiation. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that autophagy inhibition promotes the emergence of multiple aggressive tumor subpopulations due
to impaired NBR1 turnover. In aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms how NBR1 promotes basal epithelial
differentiation in carcinoma cells. In aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of autophagy inhibition on tumor recurrence
and intratumor heterogeneity. In aim 3, we will scrutinize how therapeutically modulating autophagy, both
positively or negatively, impacts metastatic differentiation via promoting the turnover or sequestration of NBR1.
Overall, this proposal will elucidate the mechanisms by which autophagy and NBR1 control aggressive
differentiation programs in breast cancer and how this regulation impacts recurrence and treatment response."

The Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine (DAPM) at UCLA has a long tradition of academic
productivity and excellence as reflected by our consistent ranking among top 10 Anesthesiology departments in
the country. The department has trained many leaders in the fields of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain
Medicine and has a long history of excellence in both basic and clinical research. The main goal of our T32
training program is to provide training and mentoring to anesthesiology residents/fellows/junior faculty early in
their careers in basic, translational, and preclinical research in the department. Our T32 research training
program has four main research themes: 1) Perioperative Organ Protection, 2) Cardiovascular, 3) Neurosciences
and Brain Health, and 4) Biocomputing/Bioengineering and Health Informatics. The department has strong
leaders in each of these fields. We have recruited 27 exceptional faculty mentors (13 PhD scientists and 14
physician-scientists) from the Department of Anesthesiology and other departments across UCLA, including the
Departments of Medicine, Bioengineering, Physiology, Surgery, Pathology, Molecular, Cell, and Developmental
Biology, Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Computer Science, and Human Genetics. Our faculty have
expertise in a wide range of research areas broadly related to the anesthesiology specialty. Eleven of these
faculty are from the Department of Anesthesiology. We have also recruited eight junior anesthesiologist-
scientists from our department as “Up and Coming Faculty”. All of these junior faculty are on track to becoming
independent physician-scientists and are dedicated to training the next generation anesthesiologist-scientists.
We request two trainee slots for the first year and three slots thereafter. We will focus our recruitment efforts
towards outstanding MD and MD/PhD candidates from the pool of our residents (mainly from Research Scholars
Track, which is a five-year program that includes almost two years of protected research time junior faculty, or
Research Pathway that includes up to 11 months of research during residency) as well as our fellows and junior
faculty. We will require a minimum two-year commitment from our T32 trainees but will extend the training to
three years if the additional year is beneficial to the individual upon approval from the T32 Executive Committee.
Our T32 training program is specifically designed to train the next generation of academic anesthesiologists to
become independent physician-scientists in the field of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine."
10611031,"The long-term goals of this research are to determine the mechanisms that underlie Post-Acute
Sequelae of SARSCoV-2 (PASC)-related symptoms in Veterans and to develop targeted and
personalized treatments. PASC is a condition of long-term symptom burden following
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is having serious adverse effects among Veteran
populations. Known colloquially as Long-COVID, symptoms of pain, fatigue, irritable bowel, and
cognitive impairment overlap considerably with chronic multisymptom illnesses (CMIs) such as
myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Gulf War illness (GWI).
Critically, all three conditions report that physical activity worsens their illness, a characteristic of
CMIs known as post-exertional malaise (PEM).
As with CMIs, PEM is a promising model for studying Long-COVID in Veterans because, as we
have shown in ME/CFS and GWI, PEM reveals pathophysiology not apparent at rest by
challenging multiple physiological systems. The causes of PEM/CMIs are currently unknown,
but converging evidence suggests that gut-microbiome perturbations and neuroinflammation act
to sustain/worsen symptoms.
Our central hypothesis is that neuroinflammation and gut-microbiome perturbations act
to produce and maintain symptoms, and that dysfunction among these systems is best
studied using an exercise challenge model. Our pilot data indicate that those with CMI: 1)
report moderate-to-large symptom changes and worsened cognitive performance following a
standardized exercise challenge; 2) show disturbed gut microbiome at rest and differential
responses to exercise compared to controls, and 3) that peripheral inflammation (interleukin-6)
is associated with augmented brain activity during fatiguing cognition in ME/CFS compared to
controls. We intend to extend our exercise challenge research in CMI to PASC with the
following specific aims:
Aim 1: To determine the effects of a standardized exercise challenge on PEM (symptoms and
cognition).
Aim 2: To determine the effects of a standardized exercise challenge on gut microbiome
structure and function.
Aim 3: To determine the effects of a standardized exercise challenge on neuroinflammation.
This study will significantly enhance our understanding of PASC and will begin to determine the
pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie symptoms at rest and symptom worsening with
physical effort. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique window of opportunity to evaluate
pathophysiology early in disease development and with known proximity to the initiating event –
i.e., COVID-19 infection. This is a rare occurrence in CMI research, and one that can provide
critical mechanistic insight to aid in the development of targeted and personalized therapies."
10762339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Telomeres—which define and protect the ends of humans’ linear chromosomes—serve as a natural check on
carcinogenesis. Genome stability requires cells to differentiate telomeres from perilous DNA double-strand
breaks (DSBs) to block inappropriate DSB repair and DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, which humans
accomplish with the shelterin complex. Telomerase maintains telomere length in the gonads and some stem
cells, but telomeres in somatic cells shorten with each cell division due to developmental silencing of
telomerase. Unfettered cell division in early neoplasms eventually leads to a few telomeres becoming critically
short and activating persistent DDR signaling, which causes cells with functional p53 and Rb pathways to
undergo senescence or apoptosis. Cells defective in these pathways continue to divide until multiple telomeres
become de-protected and then enter telomere crisis, defined by poor cell viability due to intolerable genomic
instability, as chromosomes repeatedly fuse at their ends and break. Clinical tumors emerge from crisis with
rearranged, aneuploid genomes and a telomere maintenance mechanism. To escape from telomere crisis, I
predict that malignant cells must reconstitute their telomeres and that telomerase may accomplish this by
directly repairing non-telomeric chromosome ends with neotelomeres.
 The objective of the proposed project is to identify and mechanistically characterize telomerase-
mediated DSB repair in human cells. In vitro, telomerase can add TTAGGG repeats to a non-telomeric
breakpoint sequence derived from a patient with α-thalassemia due to a terminal chromosomal truncation.
Using this sequence, I have designed a PCR-based reporter assay to detect neotelomere formation in cells at
an inducible DSB and have gathered evidence that suggests that telomere healing occurs in human cells in a
telomerase-dependent manner. I will improve this assay with TaqMan probes on a qPCR platform to rigorously
quantify telomere healing events and will perform further experiments to demonstrate that telomerase is
responsible for TTAGGG repeat addition. Because telomerase-mediated repair threatens to convert DSBs into
terminal chromosome deletions, I hypothesize that human cells have evolved mechanisms to block telomerase
activity at DSBs. I will implement a genetic approach with my telomere healing assay to identify the physiologic
repressors of this aberrant mode of DSB repair. Ultimately, I aim to unveil a new role for telomerase in enabling
incipient cancers to traverse the bottleneck of telomere crisis. This leap in our understanding of genomic
instability in early tumorigenesis may lead to unexpected ways to detect and prevent cancer in patients. With
the aid of this award and the stimulating environment of the Tri-Institutional MD/PhD Program, I will grow
scientifically, medically, and professionally in ways that will enable me to advance toward my long-term career
goal of leading a cancer-centric lab while providing patient care as a transformative physician-scientist."

 The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary
Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare,
autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored
care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of
environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to
leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing
new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic
architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi-
omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular
circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating
cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test
this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum
statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features
will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.
 To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team
synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and
Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply-
phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary
data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome
differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune
composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using
mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a
cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome”
using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We
also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim
3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC-
associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC
patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic
analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new
hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies."
10767299,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dentists are responsible for approximately 10% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. Many
of these antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary and place patients at risk of adverse drug events, including
allergic reactions and infections with drug resistant organisms. However, improving antibiotic prescribing
practices in dental settings is challenging. Dental clinics often lack the resources to design and implement
policies to evaluate dental antibiotic prescribing practices and design interventions to improve prescribing
practices.
My long-term goal is to oversee the development of electronic clinical decision support tools (CDST) to
facilitate optimal antibiotic prescribing among dentists. I envision creating, pilot testing, and disseminating
CDSTs that can be embedded within electronic health record systems, including electronic dental record
systems, to improve adherence to science-based practices while making the lives of clinicians easier.
This specific proposal aims to design and implement a novel web-based application “app” that can be
accessed by dentists on mobile phones or websites. Our first aim is to design the CDST based on focus group
feedback from dental students, residents, and faculty at the University of Illinois College of Dentistry (UIC-
COD). Our second aim is to pilot test the app using clinical vignettes and validated technology survey
questions. The third aim is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of our CDST within UIC-COD
using a dissemination and implementation research framework. We will propose to measure changes in
antibiotic knowledge and confidence in antibiotic decision making before and after implementation of the CDST
using paired surveys. We will also use surveys to measure provider satisfaction with the CDST. We will track
CDST usage (implementation metrics) using Google analytics. After completion of this project, we plan to test
our CDST in community dentists via the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research Dental Practice
Based Research Network and apply for grant funding to embed this CDST into electronic dental record
systems."
10747873,"RNA nanotechnology provides molecules that have the simplicity in design with the characteristics of DNA and
can be used in therapies. However, a major problem in RNA nanotechnology is that RNA molecules are
relatively unstable such as their degradation in vivo and dissociation at ultra-low concentration after
administration. Intravitreal injection is the most common method to deliver macromolecular therapeutic agents
to the posterior segment of the eye for the treatments of diseases. Repeated intravitreal injection can cause
severe adverse effects to the eye. For small drug molecules, systemic administration can be used but this
route of administration is complicated by systemic toxicity. There is an unmet need of a more effective drug
delivery method in the treatment of posterior eye diseases. We have recently studied RNA nanoparticles
derived from the three-way junction (3WJ) of the packaging RNA (pRNA) of bacteriophage phi29 DNA
packaging motor for ocular drug delivery. These nanoparticles are thermodynamically and chemically stable
both in vitro and in vivo and can harbor multiple modules with different functionalities such as RNA aptamer,
reporter moiety, and therapeutic siRNA, miRNA, or other chemical drugs or ligands as subunits all in the same
nanoparticles. Our preliminary studies have shown that the pRNA nanoparticles (pRNA nano) were
internalized in the cells in the cornea, retinal pigment epithelium, and retina in the eye after subconjunctival
injection in mice in vivo. This suggests the potential of subconjunctival injection of pRNA nano as an efficient
drug delivery system of RNA-based therapeutic agents to the cells in the posterior segment of the eye: pRNA
nano can overcome both the RNA molecule stability and posterior eye delivery problems. The preliminary
studies have also suggested that the delivery and retention of pRNA nano are particle size dependent and the
existence of an optimal size range for their effective delivery to the cells in the eye. The objectives of the
present project are to (a) determine the optimal pRNA nano for ocular drug delivery, (b) demonstrate the ability
of pRNA nano to deliver therapeutic agents to treat posterior eye disease, and (c) develop an episcleral
implant system for prolonged delivery of these nanoparticles. pRNA nano of different sizes and module
subunits will be constructed and evaluated for effective intraocular delivery and therapeutic effects after
subconjunctival injection in animal models. The episcleral implant is refillable and is placed on the sclera in the
subconjunctival or sub-Tenon pocket to provide sustained delivery of the nanoparticles. The ultimate goal is to
develop a platform of ocular drug delivery using the pRNA technology for nucleotide-based therapies via the
periocular route (a less invasive approach than intravitreal injection). The present project will examine the
feasibility of the combined pRNA nano and episcleral implant approach for the proof of concept of this new
technology."
10770436,"ABSTRACT. Genomic deletions of major tumor suppressor genes are frequent events in cancer yet presently
remain therapeutically unactionable for the purpose of precision oncology. Our lab has pioneered an innovative
therapeutic paradigm known as collateral lethality, whereby genes neighboring a TSG locus encoding a key
housekeeping enzyme are coincidentally deleted. We discovered that the metabolic vulnerabilities arising from
such collateral deletions may be therapeutically exploited through inhibition of the enzyme’s redundant isoform.
Emblematic of this framework are cancers harboring homozygous deletion of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase 1
(ENO1). As glycolysis is an essential bioenergetic process, ENO1-homozygous deleted cancers are entirely
reliant on the ENO2 to perform glycolysis and ensure the cellular viability. Inhibition of ENO2 selectively kills
ENO1-homozygous deleted the cancers while leaving normal tissues unperturbed. To pharmacologically act on
this vulnerability, our lab has developed an ENO2-preferred inhibitor, HEX. As testament to the strong
therapeutic viability of collateral lethality, we have shown that HEX is capable of completely eradicating ENO1-
homzoygous deleted intracranial orthotopic models of glioblastoma in mice at concentrations well-tolerated in
non-human primates. Such robust anti-neoplastic effects are unprecedented in the context of glioblastoma and
speak to the power of the collateral lethality approach. One critique of the focus of collateral lethality is its scope:
in the case of ENO1-deletions, only a small percentage of patients would be able to benefit. To broaden the
therapeutic reach of collateral lethality, this proposal will focus on targeting ENO1-heterozygous deleted cancers,
which comprise ~20% of all human cancers. This will be accomplished by adding tumor subtype-specific pro-
drug moieties onto HEX to improve its delivery. While ENO1-heterozygous deleted cancers are deficient in total
Enolase, they are not nearly as depleted as ENO1-homozygous deleted cancers are. As HEX is a negatively
charged molecule, tumor-subtype specific pro-drug attachment onto HEX will not only enhance its cell
permeability but will also improve its tumor specificity. Together, these two traits will enable drug dosing at lower
concentrations to afford a therapeutic window sufficiently large to treat ENO1-heterozygous deleted cancers
without the perturbing normal tissues. Overall, this proposal leverages the concept of rational pro-drug design to
improve the specific of our core ENO2 inhibitor so that we may widen the therapeutic reach of collateral lethality."
10771171,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand the computations underlying human motor learning and
thereby provide a framework to examine the neural underpinnings of learning, the deficits seen in neurological
disorders and how learning mechanisms can be leveraged in rehabilitation. Motor learning is the fundamental
process that involves changes in motor behavior arising from interaction with the environment. Humans spend
a lifetime learning, storing and refining a multitude of motor memories appropriate for different contexts. Current
studies of motor learning have focused almost exclusively on adaptation of individual memories in isolation. Con-
sequently, the principles underlying how the brain coordinates its repertoire of memories are largely unknown.
Our key hypothesis is that the process of contextual inference, estimating the probability with which each exist-
ing motor memory is appropriate for the current situation, controls the creation of new memories and the degree
to which different memories are expressed and updated. Our objective is to understand what leads to the cre-
ation of new memories compared to the modification of existing motor memories, and how existing memories
are recalled and updated. We have developed the COIN (COntextual INference) model to formalize the role of
contextual inference in motor learning. The COIN model performs contextual inference in a more principled and
comprehensive way than any previous model and can explain key findings traditionally attributed to adaptation
as arising instead from contextual inference, such as spontaneous recovery, savings, anterograde interference
and changes in learning rates. In contrast to current models, a critical feature of the COIN model is that it can
determine, in a principled manner, whether a new memory should be created or existing memories adapted. To
both test and develop the model, we will use behavioral studies in humans using novel robotic interfaces and
virtual reality which allow us to control a participant’s sensorimotor experience during motor learning tasks. In Aim
1 we will determine the conditions under which new motor memories are created. In Aim 2 we will determine the
rules by which existing motor memories are updated. While Aims 1 and 2 focus on reaching movements in the
plane which make a large body of previous research comparable, Aim 3 moves towards more naturalistic tasks of
manipulating objects in three-dimensions. In Aim 3 we will determine how motor memories are organized into fam-
ilies to allow efficient learning and generalization for contexts that share similar properties. Voluntary movement
is fundamental to human existence, yet many diseases such as stroke, degenerative disease, and developmental
disorders, impair human movement over the life span. By establishing a new framework of motor learning, this
project will contribute to our ultimate goal of developing assays to understand deficits in neurological disorders
and develop paradigms that can control the contextual inference process so as to improve rehabilitation."
10769788,"Project Summary/Abstract
Importance: Poor design of electronic health records (EHR) can cause providers to overlook crucial data,
consequently impeding decision-making and adversely affecting patient safety and quality of care. Typically
spending 3.3 hours per day using the EHR, ICU providers monitor 2.5 million data points per month and
respond to 187 alerts per patient per day Visualization is the science of transforming textual data into a visual
display. Dashboards are novel information visualization methods to organize data and hold the potential to
reduce information and cognitive overload, thereby improving providers' decision-making through increased
efficiency and reliability.
Objective: Our goal is to investigate the efficacy of novel information visualization methods to improve ICU
providers' decision-making, efficiency, and satisfaction.
Specific aims: (1) Characterize the effect of EHR information overload on the quality of care by measuring
prescribing providers' performance, information seeking load, information processing load using real-time
patient data in institutional Epic® and Cerner® EHR in a laboratory setting.
(2) Evaluate the effect of information visualization on providers' decision making; performance; efficiency;
fatigue; workload; and satisfaction through real patient data in a randomized controlled trial.
(3) Determine the acceptability, ease of use, and barriers to implementing information visualization dashboards
into practice in an ICU setting, using guided interviews with ICU providers.
Study Design: We will recruit ICU providers from four academic medical centers: two Epic® sites (UNC, Mayo
Clinic) and two Cerner® sites (MedStar, University of Pittsburgh). The first study will aim to characterize the
effect of current EHR information overload on providers' information processing abilities. Second, we will test
the efficacy using an information visualization dashboard to improve the decision-making, efficiency,
performance of providers compared to their institutional HER through a randomized trial. Third, we will conduct
guided interviews to understand provider's perceptions around the implementation and use of visualization
dashboard in real ICU settings.
Discussion: We anticipate that completion of these aims will yield the following outcomes: 1) to add new
knowledge around information overload-related patient safety risks in current EHRs; 2) to determine the
efficacy of a visualization tool compared to prominent EHR interfaces Epic® and Cerner®; and 3) to create
new knowledge around visualization implementation guidelines and usability best-practices. Because the
visualization tool may improve the decision-making process for providers, we expect its use will increase
patient safety and decrease the number of medical errors."
10800684,"Project Summary: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States with the national economic
costs of suicide approximated to be $53 billion annually. While suicide’s causes are complex, suicide clusters in
families and it is widely hypothesized that interactions between an underlying genetic predisposition and
environmental factors are in suicide’s causal pathway. We recently reported a heightened risk of suicide
following short-term exposure to fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide among all suicides in Salt Lake
County, Utah from 2000-2010. Complementary studies investigating the relationship between weather and
suicide have found that suicide risk increases following exposure to excessive heat, solar radiation and draught.
To date, studies have largely focused on the effects of single air pollutants or weather variables on suicide.
Thus, complex mixtures, which more realistically reflect a person’s daily exposure to ambient air pollution and
weather, have not been examined in regards to suicide. In addition, the underlying characteristics that
influence a person’s vulnerability to suicide following exposure to air pollutants and weather variables are
largely unknown yet their recognition is critical for developing effective interventions. The goals of the
proposed study are to 1) investigate thoroughly the gaps in our current knowledge of the individual, additive
and combined effects of multiple short-term environmental exposures (i.e. ambient air pollutants and weather
variables) on suicide risk, 2) identify the demographic, clinical, and familial characteristics that increase a
person’s susceptibility to suicide following short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and weather, and 3)
identify and characterize genetic variants that interact with short-term ambient air pollution and weather to
increase suicide risk. We are uniquely positioned at the University of Utah to carry out the proposed work. Data
resources already available to our research team include molecular data from >5,500 cases (Illumina
Psycharray data; whole genome sequence data is available on a subset of 665 cases). Clinical and demographic
information is available from the Utah State Office of the Medical Examiner and the Utah Population Database
(UPDB). The UPDB includes multi-generation genealogical records, demographic data, vital records data,
information on early life conditions, and current medical information on ~11 million individuals in Utah. We
will use a nested case-control design analyzed in a multi-exposure Bayesian framework to quantify the effects
of multiple environmental exposures and identify underlying individual-level and familial susceptibilities.
Gene-environment interactions will be investigated using case-only and case-crossover study designs. Study
results may lead to the development of clinical, educational and/or pharmacological interventions for suicide,
targeted at high-risk individuals."
10774246,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over a third of the world's population is infected with parasitic worms. One of the most burdensome infections
underpins the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) caused by parasitic flatworms of the
genus Schistosoma, which afflicts ~200 million people worldwide. The mainstay pharmacotherapy for
schistosomiasis, and several other parasitic helminth infections, is the drug praziquantel (PZQ). However,
several features of PZQ are severely limiting. These include an inability of PZQ to kill all stages of the parasitic
life cycle, clinical reliance on PZQ as a monotherapy in light of sub-optimal cure rates and field reports of PZQ
resistance, as well as an inability to improve upon the PZQ pharmacophore or define mechanistically how this
drug works. Consequently, there is a need to develop next generation anthelmintics, ideally active against a
broad spectrum of PZQ-sensitive helminth parasites.
Our laboratory has provided new critical insight by discovering the target of PZQ in parasitic schistosomes [1,
2]. We recently identified a Ca2+-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel (Sm.TRPMPZQ) in
Schistosoma mansoni that reproduces the characteristics of PZQ action on schistosomes: nanomolar potency,
stereoselectivity for (R)-PZQ, and mediation of a sustained, cytotoxic Ca2+ entry [1, 2]. With this target in hand,
it is now possible to conduct a screening campaign to identify novel ligands/regulators of this channel with
potential as next generation anthelmintics. Therefore, to build upon this breakthrough, we have assembled a
team combining expertise in high throughput screening (HTS), lead prioritization and optimization (Scripps
Florida), together with in-house expertise in parasitic flatworm biology (Medical College of Wisconsin, MCW).
This team will (i) execute a primary screen against Sm.TRPMPZQ (Scripps Florida) and (ii) validate the resulting
hits for efficacy against parasitic schistosome worms ex vivo, and in vivo using a murine model of
schistosomiasis infection (MCW). Prioritized hits will also be evaluated against other species of schistosome
worms, and in the longer term other parasitic flatworms with clinical relevance. A pilot screen and validation
data presented as preliminary data support the rigor of target identification, assay optimization and
miniaturization, and feasibility of the proposed pipeline for hit validation.
The proposed activities have relevance to this FOA by supporting (i) the identification of novel small molecules
with potential to treat infectious diseases and (ii) generation of new insight into the biology of parasite TRP ion
channels, which have received little attention to date as novel drug targets. If successful, these activities will
provide new leads with potential for usage as next generation antiparasitics."

where patient-specific characteristics are taken into account in the planning and control process for image-
guided robotic interventions (IGRI) to achieve a better clinical outcome. In particular, we will focus on improving
needle placement accuracy for IGRI of the prostate, as a simple, and yet a representative application of
individualized precision guidance. Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in both the
diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the
United States, where tissues are sampled from the prostate with a biopsy needle for pathological examination.
The confirmed lesions may then be focally treated with brachytherapy or thermal ablation using applicator
needles depending on clinical indications and patient preference. For those procedures, accurate needle
placement is essential to avoid false-negatives or ensure an optimal dose distribution. The demand for
accurate needle placement is growing in recent years, as clinicians are now capable of pinpointing subregions
in a heterogeneous tumor thanks to the recent progress in imaging technologies, particularly multiparametric
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the in vivo accuracies achieved by previous studies have never
matched the level of tumor subregion targeting due to needle deviation as a result of physical interaction
between the needle and the heterogeneous tissue. To address this issue, we will incorporate needle deviation
models in an IGRI system using OpenIGTLink software. Our hypothesis is that the models adapted to
individual patients will enable avoidance or compensation of needle deviation, leading to an improved in vivo
needle placement accuracy. The project comprises the following four specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a
biomechanical model with image-based semi-automatic model generation; (Aim 2) Develop a data-driven
prediction model and hybridize with the biomechanical model; (Aim 3) Extend the IGRI platform for model-
based closed-loop control using OpenIGTLink; (Aim 4) Evaluate biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid
models in vivo needle placement."

While alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and efficacious medication and
behavioral treatments exist, only a small minority with AUD in the US receive any AUD treatment.
Additionally, there are substantial disparities in receiving AUD care across several groups (e.g., racial/ethnic
minorities, women, those who live in rural locations). The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worsening of the
situation with both increases in unhealthy alcohol use and disruptions in care. However, one potentially
positive change is the dramatic rise in use of telehealth. Telehealth for treatment of AUD could increase access
to care and thereby improve treatment outcomes, but much remains unknown about how telehealth is being
incorporated into AUD care, characteristics of the patients who are receiving different patterns of AUD care
and their AUD providers, and the subsequent outcomes. It is also unclear whether telehealth in AUD care is
reducing or widening disparities in utilization.
To address this knowledge gap we will use a mixed methods study that combines analysis of Medicare,
Medicaid, and commercial insurance claims from 2016-2024, with qualitative interviews, to achieve the
following study aims: 1) identify initial longitudinal patterns of telehealth versus in-person AUD care and
assess patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with different patterns; 2) characterize the
longer-term quality outcomes associated with these initial tele-AUD patterns; 3) assess disparities in AUD
utilization over time and the association between tele-AUD use and these disparities; and, 4) explore the
perspective of providers and individuals with problematic drinking on the quality of different care patterns that
incorporate telehealth and other digital tools.
This study will provide important new information that can inform clinical practice regarding the role of
telehealth in AUD care going forward. It can help answer questions about how best to use tele-AUD to improve
access to and quality of AUD care, reduce disparities, and support recovery. The results will also inform the
ongoing debates on telehealth regulation and reimbursement policy in Congress, state legislatures, Medicaid
programs, and private insurers."

Pregnant women with overweight/obesity (PW-OW/OB) and high gestational weight gain (GWG) are at increased
risk for adverse maternal-infant outcomes. Given this high risk and the rapidly changing landscape of healthcare
delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a timely need for automated, scalable approaches relying on
remote delivery to regulate GWG. Our team addressed this need and developed the Healthy Mom Zone (HMZ)
intervention with adapted dosages to regulate GWG. Adaptations give less treatment (e.g., education) to women
who can self-regulate GWG within recommendations and more treatment (physical activity/energy intake
activities) to women who need more support to regulate GWG. Theory-based components were designed with a
multiphase, translational science framework and control systems methodology with the long-term goal to scale-
up future use by prenatal clinicians. With R01HL119245, we randomized PW-OW/OB to intervention and control
groups and examined feasibility and initial impact of HMZ on GWG. A control system driven by decision rules
and a woman’s observed GWG informed when to adapt dosages (GWG within goals, dosage was maintained;
GWG above goals, dosage was adapted). Trial feasibility markers showed high compliance, low subject burden
and attrition; compliance was better with remove vs. in-person delivery. The HMZ group had 21% lower mean
GWG and were more likely to have GWG within goals than controls. Exploratory analyses also showed promise
for HMZ to impact secondary maternal-infant outcomes. Given these initial findings, we made refinements to
increase efficacy and scalability (e.g., added sleep/eating behavior content, modified all components for remote
delivery). We replaced the initial control system with a new automated, model-based predictive control system
that forecasts a woman’s future GWG under different possible values of activity/intake behaviors and
determinants. We found that it made more efficient decisions to adapt dosages and regulated GWG better than
the initial system. With a Penn State seed grant, we built an architecture for a novel digital platform with a web
interface that automates the linkage of subject data to the new control system, computes optimized dosage
changes across multiple maternal variables, and produces a host of behavior strategies to regulate GWG. The
goal of the proposed research is to examine efficacy of the enhanced HMZ 2.0 intervention with new control
system/digital platform to regulate GWG and impact maternal-infant outcomes while collecting implementation
data to inform future scalability. N=144 PW-OW/OB will be randomized to HMZ 2.0 intervention or attention
control groups from ~8-36 weeks gestation. Aim 1 will examine efficacy of HMZ 2.0 on GWG (primary outcome)
and activity/intake behaviors and social cognitive determinants between intervention and control groups. Aim 2
will measure pre- to post-intervention differences in secondary maternal sleep/eating behaviors and infant birth
weight. Aim 3 will examine impact of implementation markers on HMZ 2.0 efficacy on study outcomes to inform
future scalability. Impact of this novel research is an optimized and highly scalable intervention to regulate GWG."

 Parvalbumin (PV) neuron hypofunction and increased excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio in feedforward
cortical circuits likely contribute to abnormal sensory processing in Autism Spectrum Disorders, but the origins
and molecular mechanisms of PV hypofunction, and its generalizability beyond feedforward circuits, remain
unclear. Here, I will test the hypothesis that PV circuit hypofunction arises because of impaired homeostatic
plasticity of PV circuits, that normally acts to maintain cortical excitability during periods of shifting sensory
input. In L2/3 of whisker primary somatosensory cortex (S1), PV circuit homeostasis is robustly engaged by
brief whisker deprivation, which reduces intrinsic excitability of PV neurons, decreasing feedforward inhibition.
In Aim 1.1, I will use in vitro electrophysiological measurements of PV cell excitability to test for impaired PV
circuit homeostasis in two ASD mouse models (Fmr1-/y and Tsc2+/-). These models share PV hypofunction but
differ in several molecular and synaptic phenotypes, making them a powerful test case for whether the PV
hypofunction may arise from a common source.
 Previous physiological studies have primarily focused on dysfunction in bottom-up feedforward circuits
in ASDs, but recent reports in people with ASDs suggest that sensory processing issues may result from a
functional deficiency in top-down feedback pathways, resulting in overreliance on feedforward input. Top-down
pathways provide strong input to S1, but it is unknown whether the physiology of feedback pathways is altered
in ASD mouse models and whether their alteration may also result from a failure of homeostasis in PV cells. In
Aims 1.2 & 1.3, I will assess changes in baseline function and homeostatic plasticity of S2->S1 inputs to L2/3
pyramidal and PV cells in S1 using optogenetics.
 Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie impaired PV circuit homeostasis in ASDs may
enable therapeutic interventions to restore PV circuit function. These molecular mechanisms are currently
unknown. I will identify the molecular mechanisms underlying deprivation-induced weakening of PV intrinsic
excitability, the key initial step in PV homeostasis. This is known to involve an increase in voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) channel currents. The molecular mechanisms likely involve activity-dependent protein
synthesis, which is reportedly dysregulated in both the Fmr1-/y and Tsc2+/- mice, though potentially in opposite
directions. A promising candidate signaling pathway that could mediate PV circuit homeostasis is activity-
dependent synthesis of transcription factor ER81 leading to increased Kv1.1 expression in PV cells. In Aim 2, I
will use novel cell-specific genetic strategies to test the hypothesis that PV circuit homeostasis requires protein
synthesis in vivo and involves activity-dependent synthesis of ER81 and increased Kv1.1- and this is impaired
in ASD mice. I will also develop CRISPR tools to modulate Kv1.1 levels to rescue PV homeostasis in ASD
mice, potentially leading to therapeutic approaches for ASDs."
10899598,"Project Summary/Abstract
The balance between immune tolerance and activation lies at the heart of most pathologies. Immunological
tolerance refers to the set of processes that prevent immune activation against non-pathogenic antigens. The
key distinguishing feature of tolerance compared to other forms of immunosuppression is that it operates to
inhibit reactivity only to specific antigens and does not render the host immunosuppressed with respect to
unrelated pathogens. Immune homeostasis relies upon precise tuning of this tolerance-activation axis, and
disruption of this balance results in autoimmunity or malignancy. To date, nearly all our treatments for
autoimmune disease result in some form of nonspecific immunosuppression. Conversely, while
immunotherapies represent the greatest paradigm shift in oncology in decades, they largely act to induce broad
immune activation in a nonspecific manner that often results in adverse events, including autoimmune
pathologies. In solid organ transplantation, our inability to induce complete graft tolerance often requires the use
of lifelong immunosuppressants. Thus, despite over a half-century of research into immunological tolerance,
there remains a pressing need to develop therapies capable of controlling antigen-specific
immunological tolerance for a wide range of diseases and clinical settings. In this proposal, we seek to
develop a new class of modular immunotherapies that couple intrinsic T cell biology with synthetic biology and
genome engineering to reeducate endogenous tolerance programs in the host. We hypothesize that by
activating or disrupting aberrant tolerance programs, we can treat autoimmune disease and metastatic
cancer. Lymph nodes are the anatomical hubs of peripheral tolerance induction, a feature that is coopted by
malignancies as they metastasize throughout the host. Unlike conventional engineered cell therapies whose
mechanism of action relies upon cytolysis of pathogenic cells, including tumors or autoreactive lymphocytes, the
engineered cell therapies that we propose instead function by trafficking to lymph nodes to alter
endogenous tolerance induction resulting in resolution of autoimmunity or treatment of metastatic cancer. To
achieve these goals, we will develop a T cell therapy that specifically homes to lymph nodes by coopting intrinsic
naïve T cell homing machinery. In the context of metastatic cancer, we will augment this approach with the
inclusion of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that break immune tolerance and induce activation upon ligation
of the CARs following trafficking to LNs. In the context of autoimmunity, our therapies will induce tolerance
following recognition of autoantigen presentation by antigen presenting cells in lymph nodes. Thus, at the
conclusion of this project, we will deliver a new class of modular immunotherapies that harnesses the
endogenous immune response in an antigen-specific manner. This approach has the potential to deliver
cures to patients suffering from debilitating autoimmunity and stage IV cancer and is readily extensible to
transplantation, pregnancy, and infectious disease settings."

Black, Latinx, American Indigenous, and Pacific Islander students remain underrepresented in biomedical
majors and research careers. Some of this problem is because science courses and careers are presented in
ways that do not align with aspects of URM students’ social identities and values. URM students (particularly
female URM students) feel like they do not belong or are “imposters” in science, especially when compared to
well-represented (WR) white and Asian students (particularly male WR students). Bolstering student agency is
a promising and innovative strategy that could address these issues. Nascent but growing correlational and
experimental research suggests that supporting students’ orientation for agency has the potential to shift
aspects of student motivation for science and subjective experience in science classes, as well as instructors’
practice and classroom climate, bringing the science education that URM students are provided into alignment
with their goals and identities. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effectiveness of an
intervention designed to promote an agentic orientation among diverse college students in introductory classes
required in biomedical science majors. A longitudinal, cluster-randomized, active control experiment (N~90
classes and 6,750 students) across multiple universities will be conducted to test the hypothesis that an
intervention promoting an agentic orientation (i.e., training students to adopt a malleable mindset of their
science motivation and classroom environment and use a variety of agentic engagement strategies) supports
students’ initial persistence and achievement in biomedical science via psychological and environmental
processes (Aim 1), as well as their sustained persistence and achievement up to 4 years following the start of
the intervention study (Aim 2). Persistence and achievement outcomes include course grades, GPA, course-
taking, biomedical degree obtainment, and career/graduate program intentions. Proximal process variables
include reports of students’ agentic mindset, engagement, interest, psychological needs, self-efficacy, identity,
perceived belonging, imposter beliefs, and empowerment, as well as classroom motivating climate reports and
observations. The inclusion of a condition combining the student-focused agentic orientation intervention with a
training intervention for science instructors on encouraging students’ agency, autonomy, and motivation will
provide the opportunity to examine the added benefit of training teachers over and above the benefits of the
student-focused intervention alone (Aim 3). Finally, this large, well-powered intervention study will allow for
testing of the hypothesis that an agentic orientation intervention will be equally or more effective for URM vs.
WR students and exploration of the extent to which intervention effects vary depending on other characteristics
of students (e.g., gender, first-generation, personality, values) and the classroom (instructors’ mindset and
motivational approach, class size, racial climate) (Aim 4). This research is a critical step toward creating a cost-
and-time-efficient, scalable intervention to support student persistence in biomedical sciences."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammatory
processes that lead to joint destruction. Immunologically, autoreactive CD4+ T cells play a central role in
disease pathology and activate B cells leading to pathologic lymphoid aggregates within the synovium and
autoantibody production. Although identifying the molecular targets recognized by pathogenic CD4+ T cells is a
critical first step in understanding the molecular basis of RA, we still do not know the antigenic targets for the
vast majority of synovial CD4+ T cells and how such reactivities relate to autoantibody responses. We have
developed a pipeline for CD4+ T cell antigen discovery in RA that relies on a new, cell-based genetic-screening
technology that enables mapping of TCR specificities at genome scale. Based on our preliminary single-cell
transcriptomic data, we have identified several interesting CD4+ T cell populations in synovial fluid that are
clonally expanded and have begun to discover their TCR targets.
This proposal is a five-year research and training plan with a scientific focus on identifying the antigenic targets
of clonally expanded CD4+ T cells from RA synovium and understanding how such antigens relate to
autoantibody responses. We propose in Aim 1 to map the antigenic epitopes and assess the corresponding
HLA-restriction of clonally expanded synovial CD4+ TCRs by performing peptidome-wide antigen discovery
screens. Aim 2 dissects T cell-B cell collaboration in the arthritic joint by interrogating antibody repertoire
binding specificities and performing CD4+ T cell-B cell co-culture assays. Finally in Aim 3, we will engineer an
antigen discovery platform to enable our ability to uncover synovial TCR reactivities against
citrullinated-peptide antigens, a prominent post-translational modification observed in RA.
This study combines cutting-edge genetic and transcriptomic technologies with mechanistic work to critically
evaluate the antigen-specific landscape of RA. It will provide the candidate new training in several scientific
areas to pursue translational immunology research. The candidate’s immediate career development goals are
to gain experience with bioinformatic analysis, antibody profiling technologies, and human immunology assays.
A specific career development plan is described by both the candidate and the mentors, Dr. Stephen Elledge,
an expert in functional genomics and technology development, and Dr. Michael Brenner MD, an expert in
lymphocyte biology and RA, taking advantage of the powerful resources available at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The candidate’s long-term career goal is to attain a tenure-track faculty
position leading a diverse group of collaborative scientists dedicated to studying antigen specific immune
responses in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases and their potential applications for therapy."

Research in cardiovascular science is rapidly progressing, as cardiovascular disease remains the largest cause
of mortality and morbidity in the United States, particularly as the population ages. At the same time, however,
surgeon-scientists have increasing clinical responsibilities which they must meet to fulfill teaching and
reimbursement requirements. All of this occurs in the backdrop of a highly competitive funding environment. Thus,
there is a significant threat to maintaining surgeon-scientists to address the critical issues in vascular biology and

be the leaders in this field over the next decade(s), by providing them with the tools and knowledge to become
independent scientists. We believe this training program has and will continue to give the next generation of
vascular disease-focused surgeon-scientists an outstanding platform to build from and to launch an independent
career in translational science. The current T32 proposal, “Translational Research Training in Cardiovascular

physician (MD, MD/PhD, DO) trainee per year to choose from one of three distinct tracks: (1) basic
science/translational science; (2) health services/outcomes; or (3) biomedical engineering. A great strength of
the program is the cross fertilization between the three curricula with common elements of training for all
pathways. Training takes place at various locations throughout campus including the North Campus Research
Complex (NCRC), the Biomedical Research laboratories, School of Engineering laboratories, and at the Michigan
Medicine Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center. Faculty for the program come from multiple disciplines
and include funded, committed investigators with strong mentoring track records that are in various disciplines
including Vascular Surgery, Biomedical Engineering, Cardiovascular Medicine, General Surgery, Internal
Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, Molecular and Integrated Physiology, Pharmacology, and Radiology.
The common thread in this program is the emphasis on the study of vascular biology and cardiovascular science
with the ultimate goal to develop the next generation of physician-scientists in academic vascular biology and

methods used in implementation science, however, challenge the current training of investigators and IRB
committees. To meet the unique ethical challenges of conducting equity-minded implementation science, the
ETHICS core will assist Project Leads, pilot study, and other investigators with understanding and meeting the
ethical and regulatory requirements related to their specific implementation projects.
Aim 1. Establish the Implementation Research Ethics Consultation Service.
Core leadership will conduct Ethics Consultations with Project Leads and other KUMC implementation
researchers to: a) identify ethical and design-related challenges in their protocols; b) encourage Project Leads
to work with the CEO Core to get stakeholder input on research design and implementation; and c) develop an
Implementation Science and Equity in Human Subjects Plan for each study to address aspects of research that
involve vulnerable populations and novel research design. The Core will also establish the Ethics Navigation
service. The ETHICS Navigator, with expertise in regulatory practices and requirements, will assist Project
Leads and other investigators conducting implementation research to develop protocols/consent, interact with
the IRB, submit protocols, revise protocols, and remain up to date on all human subjects-related trainings and

Aim 2. Curate and provide trainings to support ethical research in Implementation Science and Equity.
The ETHICS Core will identify relevant internal and external trainings and link researchers with trainings as
appropriate. It also will enhance KUMC’s existing Responsible Conduct of Research and Good Clinical
Practice trainings to include examples of implementation and disparities research; incorporate evidence
regarding structural discrimination, and integrated exercises related to implicit bias. The Core will provide IRB
member training in these research approaches to build institutional capacity for appropriate review.

10764249,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent form of dementia and one of the largest public health challenges
worldwide. Thus, developing early interventions to prevent or delay AD progression is vital. Neuronal network
dysfunction is an early characteristic of AD, observed in people at risk of developing this disorder, and has
been linked to abnormal activity of cortical parvalbumin (PV) containing interneurons. Another early
characteristic of AD is sleep abnormalities, observed years before the onset of cognitive impairment. While
both these issues develop during early stages of AD and are potential factors that exacerbate subsequent AD
pathogenesis, the relationship between abnormal PV neuron activity and sleep impairment has not been
investigated. The overarching hypothesis here is that abnormal excitability of PV neurons during the early
stage of AD is responsible for impaired sleep oscillations, further accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), and impaired
cognition. Thus, early interventions, correcting PV abnormalities could prevent sleep disturbances, slow down
Aβ accumulation, and prevent memory deficits in AD. The proposed experiments utilize well-established AD
mouse models (APP/PS1 and 5XFAD) and focus on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area critical for
generation of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) slow waves and one of the earliest regions to accumulate Aβ,
and the hippocampus (HPC) which is vital for learning and memory and altered in AD. Previous in vitro studies
using these AD mouse models reported findings regarding PV abnormalities which appear to contradict each
other. Thus, Aim 1 of this proposal will use the state-of-the-art fiber photometry technique, along with local field
potential recordings in vivo to longitudinally characterize how neuronal activity in PV neurons and pyramidal
neurons change, and how changes in PV interneurons relate to sleep oscillations across early to later stages
of AD in the two mouse models with different timecourses of AD pathology. Aim 2 will assess the therapeutic
benefit of sustained manipulation of PV neurons via chemogenetics on sleep oscillation abnormalities, Aβ
level, and behavior (HPC-dependent memory). If successful, this work will identify the timing of AD-related
disruption of cortical network activity, sleep oscillation biomarkers and inform early intervention strategies to
prevent or delay AD progression. The training plan for this award includes mentorship from an expert team of
Harvard Medical School/VA Boston faculty specializing in sleep research, cortical oscillations, neuroanatomy,
and AD. Faculty investigators from Boston University/VA Boston and the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center will provide comprehensive training on AD research in humans and in mouse models. The
proposed technical and conceptual training in fiber photometry and histochemical assay for AD pathology, as
well as didactic courses and workshops relevant to AD and professional development will facilitate the
applicant's goal of becoming an independent investigator in the AD research field."

10792616,"Project Summary
 This project aims to deliver real-time aberration-corrected multiphoton imaging with improved signal-to-
noise-ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution for studying turbid deep-tissue (~2 mm) of living animals at the cellular
level. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has been a useful tool to study biological processes due to its high
specificity and sub-wavelength resolution. Particularly, compared to one-photon imaging, MPM uses excitation
light with a longer wavelength that penetrates deeper into tissues, while the nonlinear process requires a
multiphoton interaction that renders three-dimensional localized excitation. However, the higher-order nonlinear
excitation is more susceptible to focus aberrations, thus, posing a limit for penetration depth in highly scattering
tissues. Adaptive optics (AO) has been a promising tool for aberration sensing and correction for MPM in living
systems. However, two major issues in existing AO methods, 1) accuracy, and 2) speed in aberration sensing,
remain challenging to in vivo real-time deep-tissue imaging.
 I propose to develop a new high-throughput direct aberration sensing and correction method for MPM,
termed confocal gradient light interference microscopy (CGLIM). This technique aims to measure the aberrated
wavefront using a common-path, phase-shifting interferometer, to undo the systematic and specimen-induced
aberration which, in turn, will improve the quality of the excitation focus and enhance the signal strength.
Specifically, compared to other efforts, CGLIM uses the long-wavelength (~1.7 μm) elastic backscattered light
from tissues to directly measure the aberrated wavefront of the excitation beam, resulting in substantially lower
power compared to fluorescence techniques and eliminating photodamage, photobleaching, or heating damage
of living systems. Importantly, CGLIM measures the aberrated wavefront only near the focal plane with
nanoscale sensitivity (~2 nm or ~0.002 rad) owing to its common-path, confocal configuration. Furthermore,
CGLIM can validate the accuracy of the aberration sensing by itself via phase conjugation. Lastly, the aberration
correction procedure is directly fed by CGLIM’s measurement in a closed loop without any iterations. CGLIM is
also readily implemented in any laser-scanning system with objectives of different numeric apertures.
 With the proposed new method, I will first demonstrate aberration sensing and correction using CGLIM
with tissue phantoms and ex vivo tissue slices. Then, I will combine CGLIM with three-photon (3P) microscopy
to demonstrate aberration-corrected 3P imaging of neuronal activities in live mice and intact adult zebrafish
brains. Finally, I aim to combine the aberration-corrected MPM with the adaptive excitation source and polygon
scanning developed in-house to study real-time neuronal activities in deep regions of live brains, and T cell –
dendritic cell interactions in deep regions of a mouse’s lymph node.
 With this project, I hope to establish my research focus on aberration-corrected interferometric
multiphoton imaging for deep tissues in living animals and enable more studies in neuroscience and immunology."
10772033,"Protein-protein interactions are involved in a broad range of cell function and signaling. Various protein binders
have been developed to detect or modulate such interactions for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic
applications. However, existing protein binders usually bind to their targets in noncovalent mode only, imposing
limitations on affinity, stability, and completeness. In addition, covalent bonding between a drug and its target
offers multiple desirable therapeutic properties over noncovalent interactions of conventional drugs. Such
covalent mode has been implemented in small molecule drugs with great success in recent years, yet the
therapeutic potential of covalent protein drugs remains largely untapped. To change this paradigm, this project
will develop covalent protein binders and generate covalent protein drugs. New latent bioreactive amino acids
will be designed and genetically incorporated into protein binders, which will react with a natural residue of the
target only upon protein binding, selectively creating a stable covalent linkage between the two proteins.
Covalent protein binders specific for immune-checkpoints and membrane receptors associated with cancer will
be generated. The distinct effects of these covalent protein binders on cancer cell signaling and function will be
assessed in vitro, and their cytotoxic activity and anti-tumor efficacy as covalent protein drugs will be evaluated
in xenografted mouse models. The success of this project will instigate a new dimension for researching cell

10832981,"A major clinical challenge in breast cancer is to prevent and to treat metastatic disease. Two key hurdles for
therapies for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients are to treat brain metastases (BrnMets) and to prevent
progression of bone metastases (BonMets). Chemotherapeutic drugs, including the taxanes, remain mainline
therapies for stage IV patients with MBC. However, prolonged clinical use of taxanes is associated with
development of multidrug resistance, dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicity, and neurotoxicity.
 Our ongoing efforts in this area has led to an investigational new drug, Sabizabulin. Use of Sabizabulin in
MBC and other tumor models demonstrated suppression of primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis, and
effectiveness in overcoming taxane resistance. Since Sabizabulin has limited brain penetration, its further
modification led to the discovery of SB-216, a highly brain penetrable analog that has excellent efficacy in multiple
taxane-resistant tumor models. To further develop the SB-216 scaffold for MBC, the goals of this project are
to: (1) perform focused structural optimization based on the SB-216 scaffold to produce new potent and high
brain penetrable analogs that can overcome taxane resistance for MBC BrnMets management; and (2) develop
novel drug conjugates with bisphosphonate (BisPhos) for MBC bone BonMets treatment.
 AIM 1. Perform focused structure-based optimization based on the SB-216 scaffold to develop new analogs
with high brain penetration ability. Crystal structures of tubulin/SB-216 complexes will be used to guide focused,
iterative lead optimization. We will screen new analogs in vitro using a panel of MBC cell lines, including cells
derived from PDX models, and normal cells. We will determine their brain penetrations to select the ten best
compounds for in vivo efficacy studies. AIM 2. Determine the in vivo efficacy of selected SB-216 analogs for
suppressing MBC BrnMets. We will first determine the maximum tolerable dose and pharmacokinetics for
selected SB-216 analogs from Aim 1 to identify the overall best three analogs for in vivo evaluation using multiple
well-characterized, pre-clinical models of MBC, including taxane-refractory models, each with pre-existing
BrnMets to score for delay of metastatic progression. AIM 3. Conjugate Sabizabulin, SB-216 and its new analogs
with BisPhos for more efficacious targeting of MBC BonMets, using the best Sabizabulin conjugate and paclitaxel
as the references. Conjugating Sabizabulin, SB-216, or its new analogs with a BisPhos drug with very high
affinity to bones will increase the efficacy of treating BonMets. Thus, we will optimize the linker chemistry and
evaluate a variety of BisPhos drugs for conjugation. Conjugates will first be evaluated in vitro for stability and
activation to select the two best conjugates for further in vivo efficacy studies using BonMet pre-clinical models.
 Impact: The addition of a new generation of tubulin inhibitor to the existing panel of chemotherapeutic drugs
is likely to improve MBC patient PFS, OS and QOL. In addition, patients diagnosed with other types of metastatic
solid tumors in which tubulin inhibitors are currently standard of care (SOC) could also benefit from this project."

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research, a big challenge is the identification and targeting of key molecules in
critical neural circuits that play a causal role in cognitive impairment at the early stage before global
neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that transcriptional downregulation of selective neuronal genes in early AD
initiates the loss of synaptic function in specific brain circuits, leading to cognitive decline. In Aim 1, we will identify
transcriptomic changes at the early stage of AD using human postmortem tissues and iPSC-derived cortical
neurons. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of large-scale bulk and single-cell RNAseq data from
postmortem human with ‘early-pathology’ and ‘late-pathology’ of AD will be performed to identify prominent
changes in gene networks, molecular pathways and biological processes at different stages. Given the limitation
of postmortem tissues in capturing early molecular alterations, we will also profile transcriptional changes using
human cortical neurons differentiated from iPSCs of sporadic AD patients. Based on our preliminary data, the
loss of selective presynaptic and postsynaptic genes involved in vesicle release and glutamatergic/GABAergic
transmission is the major early change in cortical neurons of AD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify
electrophysiological changes using AD mouse models and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from AD patients. We
will use in vivo multichannel recording of action potential spikes, optogenetic isolation of neural pathways and
ex vivo patch-clamp recording of synaptic currents in AD mouse models to obtain the high-resolution mapping
of cognitive circuits that go awry at various stages. In Aim 3, we will identify intervention strategies to rescue AD-
associated functional deficits in AD mouse models and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from AD patients. Guided
by the identified molecular and circuitry changes in AD, we will use viral-based approaches to normalize gene
expression or neuronal activity in specific circuits, and examine the impact on synaptic transmission and
cognitive behaviors in AD mouse models. This study will uncover transcriptomic and circuitry aberrations in early
stage of AD, and help to develop mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to mitigate synaptic deficits and
improve cognition."

African women are disproportionately affected with HIV and have elevated risk of acquiring HIV in pregnancy.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a potent HIV prevention strategy, but variable adherence in PrEP clinical
trials among women and limited pharmacologic data have resulted in lack of clarity about the degree of PrEP
use required for HIV protection in cisgender women. For US men who sex with men, the DOT-DBS and STRAND
studies of PrEP delivered as directly-observed therapy (DOT) defined precisely the target tenofovir diphosphate
(TFV-DP) concentrations arising from varying number of PrEP doses per week (i.e., 2, 4, 7 doses/ week); when
these data were then applied to the iPrEx trial cohort, they defined robust adherence-efficacy thresholds for men.
Single-dose tissue pharmacology studies have suggested that women have lower genital tissue compared with
male rectal concentrations, potentially implying women need extraordinarily high PrEP adherence to achieve
similar HIV protection; however, clinical studies in women with reasonable-but-imperfect PrEP adherence
suggest high levels of HIV protection. At root of this controversy is the lack of data that link cumulative PrEP
dosing thresholds with PrEP efficacy in women. Recently, data our team and the IMPAACT 009 Study have
generated from PrEP studies in African women suggest the STRAND levels may not truly reflect the
pharmacology of PrEP in African settings, both in general and particularly in pregnancy: These data suggest
differences in TFV-DP levels may be as great as 30-40% between pregnant and postpartum women. However,
the IMPAACT 009 study did not measure TFV-DP concentrations in PBMCs which are required to ascertain
whether the observed levels may compromise HIV protection in pregnancy. To state it explicitly, the adherence-
efficacy thresholds developed by DOT dosing in US populations may not be accurate for women in Africa and
thus interpreting women's PrEP adherence-concentration-efficacy relationships in that lens will be erroneous.
Indeed, the absence of clinical data linking intracellular concentrations to HIV protection for tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate (TDF) PrEP prevented the FDA from extending the tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) / emtricitabine (FTC)
PrEP indication to women. We have assembled a strong team with truly multidisciplinary synergy, including
leaders in the PrEP field, to conduct a novel randomized pharmacologic study to define women-specific
adherence-concentrations thresholds derived from varying frequency of DOT TDF/FTC PrEP (Aim 1). We will
take a comprehensive approach: DOT dosing, sampling from week one to steady-state, including a pregnancy
cohort, and pharmacologic measurement in multiple biologic matrices (plasma, whole blood, dried blood spots,
PBMC, and vaginal tissue). Then, leveraging archived samples, in a case-cohort study of those who acquired
HIV and a subset remaining HIV-uninfected from the Partners PrEP Study, we will define TFV-DP concentrations
associated with HIV protection for women (Aim 2). Lastly, we will apply the benchmarks to a suite of PrEP
implementation studies, testing use of women-specific adherence thresholds in real-world settings (Aim 3)."

This project, developed in response to RFA-AG-21-008, describes core plans for data collection and
dissemination of the sixth wave (Wave VI) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health), when cohort members will be 39-48 years of age (mean 44). Add Health is a longitudinal study of
a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 adolescents who were in grades 7-12 during the 1994-95
school year and have been followed for five waves to date. Over 25 years, Add Health has collected rich
demographic, social, familial, socioeconomic, behavioral, psychosocial, cognitive, and health survey data from
participants and their parents; a vast array of contextual data from participants' schools, neighborhoods, and
geographies of residence; administrative data linked to participants, including birth and death certificates; and
in-home physical and biological data from participants, including anthropometric measures, genetic markers,
blood-based assays, and medications. Ancillary studies have added more information, including epigenetic,
gene expression, and microbiome data. Thus, Add Health is exceptionally unique because it has a rich, multi-
level, longitudinal array of data for a large nationally representative cohort of Americans who are entering
midlife. Importantly, the overall health profile of the cohort as they make the transition to midlife is problematic
across many dimensions. Moreover, health disparities by race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual
minority status, and rural-urban residence in this cohort are wide and, in some cases, widening. As such, rich
longitudinal, multi-level, and nationally representative data are urgently needed to best understand the life
course determinants of health trajectories and health disparities of US adults as they enter midlife. Wave VI of
Add Health will fill this critical need. The overall goal of Wave VI of Add Health is to collect and disseminate the
comprehensive data needed to best understand the social, economic, psychosocial, contextual, and biological
determinants of health trajectories and disparities among this nationally representative cohort of Americans as
they age into midlife. The project is focused around five aims: 1) Re-interviewing cohort members using
predominantly web-based and in-person modes, with explicit attention to securing high response rates from
racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status participants; 2) Enriching study content in key domains that
will elucidate mid- and later-life health trajectories and disparities; 3) Re-visiting cohort members who consent
for an in-home health exam that includes venous blood collection and other important components of health; 4)
Assaying biological specimens for important pre-disease and disease biomarkers; and 5) Cleaning,
documenting, disseminating, archiving, promoting, and supporting Wave VI data for the scientific community.
This project has extraordinary potential to contribute to the science of aging, health, and health disparities for
decades to come, as the Add Health cohort ages into the middle adult years and beyond. Successful carryout
of this project will supply essential data for thousands of researchers working on these critical issues."

This program will address shortages in science of individuals from underrepresented (UR) groups, including
those from UR racial, gender, gender identity, ability groups and educationally disadvantaged background,
by strengthening Brown’s capacity to train more diverse Ph.D. cohorts. Using our IMSD Program as the
primary vehicle for change we will: a) Increase the numbers of UR students completing a Ph.D.degree and
pursuing careers in the biological, biomedical, & public health sciences and interdisciplinary fields to levels
proportional to their representation in the U.S. population. This will be achieved by strengthening and
expanding our successful BioMed IMSD program to other Ph.D. programs where biological training occurs.
This updated program, IMSD@Brown, will implement and establish practices that promote, improve and
sustain STEM student Ph.D. training and post-training success. It will drive increases in student
compositional diversity, institutional culture & climate, student retention & degree attainment.
IMSD@Brown will operate as the central integration hub that aligns graduate level diversity and inclusion
training practices across all programs and will institutionalize best practices by leveraging them to the benefit
of the larger Ph.D. student population across all STEM programs. The program’s practices include: 1)
developing inter-institutional relationships that serve UR students and our goals for excellence; 2) equipping
graduate programs with IMSD resources and tools that complement locally provided disciplinary-specific
training and coursework. These include training support for didactic, research, mentoring, and advising
support, training through IMSD skills-based modules, and IMSD community-building programming to foster
a sense of belonging for all students; and 3) Investing in processes that make permanent a culture that values
and promotes diversity and inclusion. IMSD Program faculty will be drawn from 21 STEM Ph.D. programs –
all of which engage in biologically & biomedically related work- to support 15 UR Ph.D. students appointed
yearly for 12 months as IMSD trainees. We will meet our, and the goal of NIH, by a) building relationships
which support UR students and enable their graduate and post-training career success, and b) improve
program outcomes by collaborating with faculty, partner institutions and the extended alumnae network
which our trainees can ‘tap’ into and c) lay the groundwork for broader change across Brown by embedding
best practices in all Ph.D. training programs."

 Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV) are all
mosquito-borne RNA viruses. They are public health concerns because (1) DENV and CHIKV cause hundreds
of millions of infections each year, with significant burdens in affected areas, (2) the outbreak of ZIKV in Brazil
in 2015/2016 caused anxieties to general population due to its association with microcephaly of newborns, and
(3) MAYV emerged in Central and Southern America recently and has the potential for epidemic spread.
Because these virus infections have virtually identical clinical presentation and they often circulate
concurrently, it is important to have a point-of-care (POC) testing platform to accurately identify virus infection
for clinical management of patients, including different complications from these viruses.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current methods authorized for
assessing DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV infections include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, these assays are carried out in
laboratories, not at POC in a clinic or in an infected field. It is also important to note that virus infection can
cause asymptomatic infections, up to 80% of ZIKV patients, 50% of DENV patients, and 28% of CHIKV
patients, respectively. As a result, POC testing in the field will be more valuable for screening asymptomatic
patients and monitoring possible virus transmission than a laboratory test because only symptomatic patients
go to hospitals or clinics for seeking medical help or to be screened.
 To address the need, we propose to develop a POC diagnostic platform called Valve-enabled Lysis, paper-
based RNA Enrichment, and RNA Amplification Devices (VLEAD). VLEAD will integrate sample preparation—
including virus lysis and RNA enrichment—with nucleic acid amplification for simultaneous detection of these
viruses. To achieve the goal, we aim to (1) develop multiplexed VLEAD for simultaneous detection of ZIKV,
DENV, CHIKV and MAYV; (2) optimize VLEAD using various samples and compare the suitability of the device
for urine, saliva and blood samples; and (3) validate VLEAD using clinical samples and compare VLEAD with
the benchmark methods including conventional RT-PCR.
 The significance of the research lies in the following aspects. First, these mosquito-borne RNA viruses are
a public health concern. An accurate and sample-to-answer virus detection platform at POC will be useful for
clinical care and patient management. Second, a large percentage of these virus infections are asymptomatic,
thus a non-invasive POC platform would be very beneficial for screening the general population in the infected
area and monitoring virus transmission. Third, the VLEAD platform can be adapted for detecting other
pathogens of interest, with a potential to have more societal impacts."

Temporomandibular disorders affect ~35 million people in the US, with 3-8 times more women affected than
men. Approximately 30% of temporomandibular disorder patients experience mechanical dysfunction of the
articular disc (an avascular tissue) in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a load-bearing joint during oral function.
However, the etiology of the temporomandibular disc dysfunction/displacement (TMDD) sub-population is poorly
understood, including why women are disproportionately affected. Logical TMDD candidate bio-indicators
include craniofacial morphology, TMJ biomechanics, disc nutrient availability, and disc metabolism, each of
which show varying degrees of sexual dimorphism. These factors interact such that subject-specific craniofacial
morphology drives TMJ biomechanics, and biomechanics regulates TMJ disc nutrient availability and cellular
metabolism/homeostasis. Study results from the preceding R01 proved that in pigs the avascular TMJ disc
nutrient environment is heavily dependent upon mechanical strain-dependent nutrient diffusion, and the nutrient
environment has a profound effect on disc cell proliferation and differentiation leading to tissue dysfunction.
Therefore, TMJ biomechanical and mechanobiological differences between sexes driven by craniofacial
morphology in humans may be critical. Our preliminary data have demonstrated sex-differences in human TMJ
loading due to sexual dimorphisms in craniofacial morphology, plus we have identified a TMJ morphologic
phenotype that may also explain sex-differences in TMDD occurrence. Therefore, it is now necessary to
determine sex differences in the mechanical strain-dependent nutrient transport properties and nutrient level-
dependent energy metabolism of the human TMJ disc and investigate the plausible associations of craniofacial
morphology and TMJ biomechanics through the mechanobiological pathway on TMDD development and
progression. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that craniofacial morphologic differences between
sexes, as well as between healthy controls and TMDD patients, drive the differences of TMJ biomechanics and
disc mechanobiology which can be used to predict individuals at greatest risk for TMDD development and
progression. The long-term objectives are to understand the mechanobiological etiology of temporomandibular
disorders, to identify risk factors specific for TMDD development, and to define TMDD mechanobiological
mechanisms of progression. Through the identification of potential morphologic, biomechanical, and biological
risk factors for TMDD development and progression, this work has promising clinical translation and lays the
foundation for future human studies. Specific outcomes of the proposed study include: determination of the
mechanical strain dependency of the temporomandibular disc nutrient environment and its impact on cell viability
and energy metabolism in human tissues, an enhanced understanding of how subject-specific morphology
results in subject-specific differences in temporomandibular biomechanics, and identification of TMDD-specific
mechanobiological bio-indicators."

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative sample of
U.S. families that began in 1968. With data have collected on the same families and their descendants for 41
waves over 51 years, and with two major immigrant refresher samples added in 1997–1999 and 2017–2019,
PSID can justifiably be considered a cornerstone for empirical social and behavioral research. PSID provides
long-term measurement, over the life course and across generations, of economic, social, demographic, and
health processes, which has inspired researchers to investigate the dynamics of these processes and their in-
terrelationships. The enormous range of research opportunities provided by the PSID data has led to PSID be-
coming one of the most widely used social science data sets in the world. NICHD has co-funded the collection
of the biennial Core PSID interview for each of the nine waves that were fielded from 2003 to 2019 and NICHD
also fully funded the 2017–2019 immigrant refresher. This project will build upon this investment through the
following three specific aims: First, to collect data on three modules—family dynamics, fertility and newborns,
and education—as part of the 2021 round of the Core PSID survey. Second, to design and field in 2021 a new
module to collect information on assimilation among immigrant families. Third, to clean, document, and distrib-
uted these data free of charge through the PSID Online Data Center, provide continuing outreach and support
to new and established data users, and encourage new research using PSID data through a small grant com-
petition. This project will make several major contributions. It will extend the longest-running household panel
survey in the world, thereby maintaining PSID as a premier data source for studying family dynamics, invest-
ments in children, and wellbeing over the life course, across generations, and over time for the entire U.S. pop-
ulation. By continuing the collection of enhanced data on educational attainment, this project will support more
detailed analyses of the determinants of schooling decisions within the family context. The on-going collection
of the PSID newborn module will significantly expand the available information on early life outcomes, which, in
turn, will enhance the value of PSID for studying birth outcomes and for investigating the consequence of birth
outcomes and very-early life experiences for subsequent life course outcomes. By continuing data collection
on the dynamic processes of family formation and dissolution, fertility, and living arrangements, this project will
allow researchers to understand the evolving complexity and circumstances of families in the U.S. The collec-
tion of new data on immigrant assimilation will support new and innovative analyses of adaptation and integra-
tion of the latest cohort of immigrants to the U.S., as well as comparisons with earlier immigrant cohorts. Fi-
nally, outreach to and support of data users, and the implementation of a small grant competition, will maxim-
ize the past and current investments in collecting Core PSID."
10770431,"Iron is an essential nutrient, but excess iron is toxic. The master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis is the hormone hepcidin, which is secreted by the liver and induces degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin to inhibit iron absorption from the diet and iron release form body stores. Hepcidin production is regulated by iron, erythropoietic drive, and inflammation to provide adequate iron for erythropoiesis and other essential functions, but to limit the toxicity of iron excess. We have discovered that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, via the ligands BMP6 and BMP2, is a central regulator of hepcidin transcription in response to most known signals. BMP ligands are dimeric proteins that were initially discovered as bone inducing factors, but are now known to play critical roles in many biologic processes from embryogenesis to adult tissue homeostasis in many organs. BMPs are made as inactive precursors comprised of a prodomain and a ligand domain that is released by proteolytic cleavage. Although prodomains lack signaling activity, there is increasing recognition from related BMP/TGF-b family members that prodomains play critical roles in ligand folding and dimerization, and may also regulate ligand/receptor interactions. Notably, BMP6 prodomain mutations have been linked to altered hepcidin regulation and iron overload in humans. We will show recently published data that BMP2 and BMP6 function together in hepcidin and iron homeostasis regulation; heterodimeric BMP4/7 and BMP2/7, rather than homodimeric ligands, are the major mediators mammalian embryogenesis; and BMP prodomains play essential roles in BMP4/7 heterodimer and homodimer formation and function. We therefore hypothesize that BMP2/6 heterodimers are a key functional ligand for hepcidin and iron homeostasis regulation and that prodomains have critical roles in BMP2/6 maturation and function. In Aim I, we will use our Xenopus system, primary liver cells, mouse models, and novel ELISA assay to test whether BMP2/6 heterodimers are present and regulated by iron in vivo, and to elucidate how BMP6 and BMP2 are proteolytically processed, how their prodomains contribute to heterodimer and/or homodimer formation and function to regulate hepcidin, and how BMP6 prodomain mutations impact these processes to cause iron overload. In Aim II, we will show preliminary data that both iron and erythropoietic drive still regulate hepcidin in the absence of BMP6 and/or BMP2, and we will identify two other BMP ligands that participate in hepcidin regulation. We will use genetic mouse models to establish the functional role of these two BMP ligands in hepcidin and iron homeostasis regulation in vivo. The long-term goals of this project are to understand how BMP signaling is regulated to control hepcidin expression and systemic iron homeostasis; how this process is perturbed in iron disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis, anemia of inflammation, and b-thalassemia; and ultimately to develop new treatments for these iron disorders. We also aim to gain fundamental insights into BMP ligand maturation and prodomain function that will be relevant for many other fields where BMP signaling is important."
10760325,"Project Summary/Abstract:
We have identified genes that act in the maturation or presentation of siRNAs that mediate antiviral defense
in C. elegans. We propose to discern how the siRNAs and other small RNAs may be edited analogous to
the ancient editing of wobble base pairs in the anticodon loop of many tRNAs, to allow this system to
anticipate infection with viruses related to virus infections recorded in the genome. Our saturation genetic
analysis of these antiviral pathways has revealed new possibilities for how the genomic record of past viral
infections via RNA editing and DNA recombination between repetitive elements can anticipate future viral
variation. This is equivalent to wobble base pairing between tRNA and codons, which is mediated by very
ancient RNA modification pathways. Thus the modern RNA world, which is heavily populated by parasitic
RNA viruses such as Covid-19, may depend on ancient RNA editing. Our hypothesis that synMuv genes
mediate gene amplification in the intestine and other tissues to produce substrates for unequal crossing over
is very unorthodox, but intersects nicely with the translocations so common in tumor biology. It could be
transformative for cancer biology."
10792487,"ABSTRACT
Female genital fistula is a debilitating injury that affects 2 to 3 million women, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Women with fistula have uncontrollable leakage of urine and/or feces (among other physical symptoms), are
heavily stigmatized, and experience high psychiatric morbidity. Preliminary evidence has identified risk of fistula
recurrence, incontinence, and pregnancy complications following fistula repair. However, the evidence base
regarding the factors contributing to these adverse outcomes is severely underdeveloped, limiting the
development of clinical interventions to reduce these adverse risks to women, preventing them from re-
experiencing the consequences of fistula, and to improve pregnancy outcomes and quality of life.
In an effort to improve the physical and psychosocial quality of life for women affected by fistula, we propose to
address the critical gaps in knowledge on risk of adverse outcomes following fistula repair by conducting a
longitudinal cohort study of 800 women repaired for fistula in 9 Ugandan facilities. We seek to identify predictors
of post-repair fistula breakdown and recurrence (Aim 1), to identify predictors and characteristics of post-repair
incontinence (Aim 2), and to engage key stakeholders in a theory-guided iterative process to develop a roadmap
of intervention strategies likely to be feasible and acceptable within this setting (Aim 3).
Our approach overcomes limitations to prior research through employing a longitudinal design; focusing on a
broad range of patient, fistula, and behavioral characteristics; and enrolling the largest number of women (800)
with the longest follow-up (3 years) to date for robust estimation. Data will be collected at time of surgery and at
2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and quarterly thereafter for 3 years through a combination of interview-administered
patient questionnaire and structured medical record abstraction, with clinical exams conducted per standard of
care and as necessary based on symptom experiences. In-depth interviews with key stakeholders (n~80,
including longitudinal participants and a range of other important roles) guided by prevalent behavior and
implementation change theories will help us to understand facilitators and barriers of behavior and
implementation targets to inform potential intervention strategies at multiple levels.
Our sample size will allow us to detect a minimum difference in effect of 20% for all outcomes. Analyses will
describe estimate the individual and joint-effects of patient, fistula, fistula repair, and post-repair characteristics
on incidence of post-repair fistula breakdown and recurrence and incontinence using proportional hazards frailty
survival models. Our findings will inform counseling and clinical care models for optimizing post-repair outcomes
for women following fistula repair."
10666613,"The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox-
aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However,
the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second-
ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at
increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors
for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown
how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char-
acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out-
comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA)
Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over-
all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant
therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ-
ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic
selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based
on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy-
pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety
of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs
dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The
proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life
decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials
to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu-
nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models
(a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment
heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific
publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and
relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a
rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to help guide personalized anticoagulant therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best
meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the
potential to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans."

epilepsy. SUDEP is second only to stroke in years of potential life lost to neurological disease and is a
major public health problem. Several etiologies have been proposed for SUDEP including cardiac and
respiratory dysregulation. Another that is postulated is impaired arousal. Seizures impair arousal. Among
arousal stimuli, one that may be particularly relevant to SUDEP is CO2. CO2 rises following seizures and
is part of the seizure cessation mechanism. Seizures are frequently associated with ictal and post-ictal
central and obstructive apneas. Apnea further exacerbates the accumulation of CO2. Impairment of CO2-
arousal is proposed as an etiological factor in another sudden death entity, sudden infant death
syndrome, which has many parallels with SUDEP. We discovered that seizures impaired CO2-arousal in
seizure naïve mice and those that do not have a particularly profound death rate. Whether this is true in
mouse models with strong SUDEP phenotypes is unknown. Thus, our goal in this proposal is to determine
how seizures in different sleep states impair CO2-arousal in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) and the genetic epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet Syndrome (DS). In Aim 1 we will determine the
extent to which CO2-arousal is impaired in epilepsy models. We will focus on the pilocarpine-TLE model
as many patients that die of SUDEP have TLE, and the DS model, as patients with DS have a
disproportionately high SUDEP risk. We will also determine whether simply having epilepsy in these
models impairs CO2-arousal as a potential easily measurable biomarker for SUDEP risk. In Aim 2 we will
determine whether neuronal function, assessed via fiber photometry, of arousal system components in
the dorsal raphe nucleus and parabrachial nucleus, two important contributors to sleep-wake regulation
and key nodes in CO2-arousal, is impaired by seizures and epilepsy. In Aim 3 we will determine whether
optogenetically stimulating a DRN-PBN circuit in DS mice, using a novel mouse model, prior to seizures
prevents seizure-induced death lending direct insights into possible therapeutic measures. Since the
models employed have known death rates, we will be able to compare findings between mice that die
and those that survive making these studies more relevant to SUDEP. Combining these findings with our
previous work, we will have a powerful, rigorous, translatable approach to identify convergent and
divergent mechanisms across models for how impaired CO2-arousal in epilepsy contributes to SUDEP
risk. We expect to be able to leverage these mechanisms to identify at-risk individuals and reduce death
from this devastating disease."
10813118,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are the leading cause of cancer death in children. Many of those
who do survive suffer from significant lifelong morbidity due to toxicity of therapy. There is an urgent need to
improve survival and decrease toxicity of therapy in children with brain tumors. My research focus is to improve
survival for children with CNS tumors through the development of novel therapeutics and clinical trials based
on biologic insights into the molecular drivers of disease. I conduct my research through collaborative studies
that are made possible by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), specifically the Children’s Oncology
Group (COG). Nationally, I serve in a leadership role as the clinical vice-chair of the COG CNS committee,
COG representative to the NIH Brain Malignancies Steering Committee (BMSC), and CNS representative to
the Agent Prioritization Committee (APC) of the NIH-funded Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network
(PEP-CTN). I have also recently led the creation of a data-sharing initiative called the INSPiRE consortium
which aims to facilitate clinical trials and genomic data sharing between the COG and other international
clinical trials consortia and registries. Locally, I serve as the Seattle Children’s Hospital site PI for COG,
Medical Director of Clinical Research for the Seattle Children’s Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer
Research, Principal Investigator of the Seattle Children’s Tumor Banking and Biology Study, and Medical
Director of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Program. These complementary national and local roles allow me to
provide support to a wide range of translational and clinical research efforts, providing access to all phases of
research to children in Seattle and translating research discovery in Seattle to children across the world
through the development of collaborative clinical trials. The opportunities afforded by this award would allow
me to devote significant time to accelerate the development of high-impact clinical trials and to support critical
efforts to improve molecular and clinical data sharing and local access to trials."
10773057,"Childhood obesity remains a significant public health crisis. Most children with obesity are likely to remain obese
as they mature and are at risk to experience significantly more lifelong physical and mental health issues,
creating significant economic and public health consequences. Thus, identification of the most salient early
predictors of obesity is essential. Despite growing evidence that a) self-regulatory skills in food and non-food
contexts and appetitive traits significantly impact childhood obesity risk, and b) obesity risk is determined by the
interplay between biological, psychological, and home environment factors, this work has occurred largely in
isolation within disciplines, greatly hindering the interpretability and application of findings. This proposal
describes a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study to leverage our existing sample of 300 mother-child dyads who
are diverse with respect to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and obesity risk and have been followed from
the prenatal period until children were 2 years old (R01HD093662). We will re-assess these children at ages 3
and 5 and recruit an additional 50 3-year-olds into this study to facilitate future longer-term follow-up into middle
childhood and adolescence. We propose a biopsychosocial model of the early development of obesity risk
that will clarify (a) the measurement structure of general self-regulation, appetite self-regulation, and food cue
reactivity, and the extent to which each has unique versus overlapping antecedents and consequences (Aim 1);
and (b) the extent to which general self-regulation and/or appetite self-regulation buffer children from the adverse
effects of specific early biological (e.g., hormones related to energy metabolism), psychological/behavioral (e.g.,
child food cue reactivity, negative emotionality), and social/environmental (e.g., obesogenic home environment,
negative parenting) risks on elevated obesity risk at age 5 (Aim 2). This innovative study has critical implications
for future targeted preventive interventions, since it will identify which target mechanisms (within the home,
individual, or both) in infancy and preschool may be most influential in preventing early obesity risk before it
becomes more difficult to reverse. By combining the theoretical and methodologic approaches of developmental
and nutritional sciences, this project will help enhance rigor in the methods used to assess distinct aspects of
food and non-food reactivity and regulation, which will be applicable to both basic and applied research.
Additionally, the proposed study will begin to fill a critical knowledge gap regarding the role of the hormonal milieu
in relation to obesity across childhood. Our multidisciplinary team has expertise in observational, physiological,
and biological assessments, and will leverage our solid existing collaborations to smoothly implement the
proposed study with rigor and efficiency."

Project Summary 
Men and women differ in their susceptibility to obesity-related disorders and estrogen is a primary protective factor in women. Premenopausal women have a lower incidence of cardiometabolic disease compared to age- matched men. After menopause, when circulating estrogens decline, a woman’s risk for metabolic syndrome and heart disease increases dramatically. The circadian system is also a critical regulator of metabolism and obesity. Circadian rhythms are ~24-hour cycles of behavior and physiology that are generated by a network of molecular clocks located in nearly every tissue in the body. These clocks are entrained by cues such as food and light and are typically synchronized with environmental light-dark cycles. Studies of shift workers, who have disordered exposure to food and light, show that disruption of the circadian system increases risk of obesity, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Our overall objectives are to elucidate the estrogen-related circadian mechanisms that regulate metabolism and to test interventions that target the circadian system and benefit women who are estrogen deficient. Most studies to date have investigated circadian regulation of obesity and diabetes in males. High-fat diet feeding in male mice profoundly disrupts daily rhythms and this circadian disruption regulates diet-induced obesity. In contrast, very little is known about the interplay between circadian rhythms and metabolism in females. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the interaction between estrogen signaling, time-restricted feeding, and circadian rhythms in regulating obesity and its comorbidities in mice and women. We will test the central hypothesis that daily metabolic rhythms are regulated by estrogen signaling and are therapeutic targets to treat obesity and prediabetes in postmenopausal women. In Aim 1, experiments will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which estradiol protects daily metabolic rhythms from disruption by high-fat feeding in female mice. These mechanisms will be studied using global estrogen receptor (ER) knockout mice and by targeting ER expression in hepatocytes. Then we will determine whether time-restricted feeding inhibits diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in female ER knockout mice. In Aim 2, experiments will test the hypothesis that time-restricted feeding improves metabolic risk factors in postmenopausal women. Using a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial design, metabolically-unhealthy postmenopausal women will be randomized to either a 16-week time-restricted feeding intervention or no intervention control and we will measure metabolic and anthropometric outcomes and circadian rest-activity patterns by actigraphy, with change in insulin sensitivity and body weight as primary outcomes. Together, these experiments will elucidate the interplay between estrogens, daily rhythms, and interventions that target circadian rhythms to alleviate metabolic dysfunction."
10788420,"Project summary
 Chronic leg ulcers are affecting approximately 6.5 million Americans and the disease includes venous stasis
ulcers, arterial ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic (neuropathic) ulcers. They are associated with significant
mortality (28% over two years), reduced quality of life (nonambulatory), and high treatment costs (>$25 billion/yr
in the U.S.). Since many chronic ulcers have underlying vascular insufficiency, accurate assessment of blood
perfusion to the wound is critical to treatment planning and monitoring. However, existing clinical tests fail to
meet this need in practice. Without timely information on circulation, a patient may need to wait months after the
revascularization surgery before any additional intervention can be planned. An accurate, noninvasive tool for
circulation assessment would greatly improve post-surgical decision making and clinical outcomes of wound
patients. This project aims to develop a three-dimensional (3D) wound assessment system using photoacoustic
tomography (PAT), a hybrid modality that detects optical absorption in tissue through the photoacoustic effect.
The conversion of optical absorption into acoustic waves breaks through the optical diffusion limit, allowing for
high-resolution imaging in three dimensions. Since hemoglobin serves as the major endogenous contrast at
near-infrared wavelengths, PAT provides label-free, three-dimensional imaging of hemoglobin distribution, which
is closely related to circulation. While PAT has shown promising results in vascular imaging, various hurdles
have prevented its application in wound evaluation. Capitalizing on the recent innovations in photoacoustic
system development and image processing, the team will address these hurdles and develop a PAT-based
wound imaging system with unique advantages in terms of spatial resolution, penetration depth, and portability.
To ensure successful implementation of the project, the PI has gathered a multidisciplinary team with expertise
in photoacoustic imaging, wound healing, vascular surgery, biostatistics, and computer science. The project has
also secured support from the region’s busiest vascular clinic located at Buffalo Generation Hospital and Erie
County Medical Center and their outpatient clinics. More importantly, the team has already worked together and
acquired preliminary data through support from the University at Buffalo’s NIH Clinical and Translational Science
Awards (CTSA) Program. Through the four-year project, the team will achieve the following aims: Aim 1: Develop
a versatile, high-resolution 3D photoacoustic imaging system that can be easily rotated and positioned to image
any regions on the foot; Aim 2: Validate the system at vascular clinics and identify photoacoustic features of
tissue perfusion; and Aim 3: Test the feasibility of using PAT to monitor tissue perfusion and guide post-surgical
assessment and treatment planning."
10771255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem that afflicts more than 37 million Americans.
The current therapeutic options for this progressive disorder are limited; therefore, novel therapeutic strategies
are urgently needed. Common features of CKD are kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Inflammation often triggers
fibrosis, and fibrosis is the end result of chronic inflammatory reactions. Renal inflammation is characterized by
macrophage activation and proinflammatory molecule production. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying macrophage activation are not fully understood. Therefore, the long-term objective of this proposal
is to understand the molecular mechanisms of macrophage activation so that effective strategies can be
developed for the treatment of CKD.
 We have identified PU.1 as a critical factor in the regulation of kidney inflammation during the
development of CKD. Specifically, we have demonstrated that PU.1 is induced in the kidney in experimental
models of CKD and in human kidney with CKD and PU.1 is obligatory for macrophage activation and
inflammatory molecule production and development of CKD. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of
PU.1 prevents macrophage activation and inflammatory molecule production in macrophages in vitro, and
pharmacological inhibition of PU.1 suppresses macrophage activation, inflammatory molecule production, and
fibrosis development in the kidney with obstructive injury. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effect of PU.1
appears to be mediated by the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome
pathway. In this application, we propose to examine and characterize the role of PU.1-NLRP3 pathway in
macrophage activation and polarization and proinflammatory and profibrotic molecule production to further
understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and development of kidney fibrosis. Our central
hypothesis is that PU.1 promotes NLRP3 expression and inflammasome activation in macrophages leading to
proinflammatory and profibrotic molecule expression and development of kidney fibrosis. To test this hypothesis,
we will pursue the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the role of PU.1 in macrophage
activation and polarization in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 2 is to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which
PU.1 promotes macrophage activation and polarization. Specific Aim 3 is to explore the therapeutic potential of
a selective PU.1 inhibitor for the treatment of CKD.
 We plan to utilize molecular, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to examine the role of PU.1-
NLRP3 pathway in macrophage activation and polarization and development of kidney fibrosis. Results from
these studies will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of kidney inflammation and could lead
to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CKD."

Exposure to total body irradiation (TBI) produced by nuclear accidents, premeditated nuclear, or terrorist attack
causes gastrointestinal (GI) acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS), a state of severe intestinal mucosal barrier
damage, loss of tissue integrity, and translocation of the luminal content. Measures to counteract the effect of
such detrimental exposure are critical for the survival and well-being of those impacted. The gastrointestinal
microbiome (bacteria and metabolites) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Multiple
studies have implicated specific microbiome clades as responsible for promoting intestinal barrier function and
consequent resistance against infections and inflammatory conditions. The central hypothesis of this project is
that targeted microbiome supplementation with specific subsets of intestinal bacteria or probiotics engineered to
produce barrier function-promoting metabolites and their enhancement via precise dietary intervention actively
improves barrier homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium, creating an environment that reduces GI-ARS. In Aim
1, we will develop novel live biotherapeutic products that minimize GI-ARS by promoting barrier function through
the potent induction of functional epithelial surface P-glycoprotein expression. Additionally, we will uncover the
broader distribution of this receptor system within clinical, metagenomic samples. In Aim 2, we will develop a
novel genetically engineered strain of the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 that minimizes GI-ARS by promoting
barrier function through the potent constitutive production of succinate. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will evaluate the effect
of prebiotics-enriched diets in promoting GI-ARS limitation by barrier-enhancing intestinal bacteria. Cumulatively,
this work will generate novel microbiome therapeutic agents that, by specifically targeting intestinal barrier
function, minimize GI-ARS and increase survival after total body irradiation."
10793559,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Blast exposures are unfortunately becoming a common experience in the military and public domains.
Balance disorders, including dizziness, visual instability, and spatial disorientation are among the most
common symptoms reported in blast injury patients. Although the etiology is unknown, it is possible that
damage to the vestibular receptors and their innervating afferents has occurred, even with low blast intensity
levels. We have developed a whole body blast generator (shock tube) for rodent use that delivers a pressure
waveform which mimics that produced by improvised explosive devices (IED). We will capitalize on our unique
expertise in vestibular research to perform a combination of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral studies
to gain insight into how the vestibular system is affected by blast exposure and leads to vestibular dysfunction.
In Aim 1, we will examine the anatomical structure of the semicircular canal and otolith receptors in C57/Bl6
mice, as well as their innervating afferents, in groups of animals receiving different intensities of a single blast
wave exposure at multiple post-blast survival days and compare them to same age litter-mate controls with no
blast exposure. In Aim 2, we will examine the dynamic response properties of canal and otolith afferents to
motion stimulation following blast exposure. In Aim 3, we will examine the response vestibuloocular reflex
(VOR) and its neural correlates in the vestibular nuclei in animals exposed to the same blast conditions and
compare them to non-blast litter mate controls. Together, these experiments seek to understand how blast
exposure affects vestibular system structure and function so that more effective protective measures and
treatment options can be developed for blast exposure patients."
10794404,"Proposal Summary/Abstract:
Though outcomes for pediatric acute leukemia have improved dramatically over the last few decades, infant
leukemia is a particularly aggressive disease which remains difficult to cure even with chemotherapy
intensification and bone marrow transplant. Most of these leukemias carry a rearrangement of the MLL gene,
a phenomenon also seen in some de novo acute myeloid leukemias (AML) as well as therapy-related AML,
and studies have demonstrated that a common gene expression program underlies these leukemias
regardless of lineage. Through preliminary studies, we have found that MLL-fusion leukemias express high
levels of MBNL1, an RNA binding protein that regulates alternative RNA splicing. We have also identified an
alternative splicing (AS) signature unique to MLL-fusion leukemia, and show that MBNL1 loss causes reversion
of this signature and impairs MLL-fusion leukemia cell growth. We thus hypothesize that MBNL1 is a critical
regulator of an MLL-fusion specific AS program, and that disruption of this program via MBNL1 inhibition leads
to leukemia cell death. To test these hypotheses, our specific aims are 1) to determine the mechanism
underlying MLL-fusion leukemia dependence on MBNL1, and 2) optimize characteristics of a small-molecule
MBNL1 inhibitor as a treatment for MLL-fusion leukemia. To achieve the first aim, we will characterize changes
in key cell growth and death pathways which we hypothesize are responsible for the effects seen with genetic
knockdown. We will also identify novel MBNL1-mRNA interactions in MLL-fusion leukemia using CLIP-seq
(cross-linking immunoprecipitation with RNAseq). For the second aim, we have shown as a proof of concept
that a small molecule inhibitor of MBNL1 can induce MLL-fusion leukemia cell death. This compound requires
optimizations for potency, which we will achieve by applying medicinal chemistry principles. Furthermore, we
have used its structural characteristics and published crystal structures to initiate an in silico screen of a
proprietary compound library. This proposal will advance our understanding of the role of AS in the
pathogenesis of MLL-fusion leukemia, while also directly leading to a first-in-class therapy for this disease.
 The applicant, who is currently an instructor in the Division of Oncology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital
Medical Center, will execute this research plan while simultaneously engaging in structured didactics and
receiving close individual guidance from a panel of mentors as described in the application. These scientists
possess significant expertise in the molecular pathogenesis of leukemia. The experiments, mentoring, and
structured classwork described in this career development plan will position the applicant to successfully
transition into an independent researcher and physician-scientist, with expertise in the role of RNA binding
proteins in leukemia pathogenesis."
10796964,"The communication between adipose immune cells and neighboring adipocytes has become increasingly appreciated over the past two decades, and its relevance to metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes is now well-recognized. We have recently discovered that acetylcholine-producing immune cells within subcutaneous adipose tissue influence thermogenic beige fat function through paracrine mechanisms via CHRNA2 (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, alpha2 subunit). Here we propose to thoroughly investigate how this immune-beige fat acetylcholine signaling, particularly via ChAT+(choline acetyltransferase) macrophages, influences adipose tissue function and whole body metabolic homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions. Our preliminary studies reveal that cold exposure significantly increased percentage of macrophages that express ChAT in subcutaneous fat. We have generated multiple mouse lines with genetic deletion of Chat in various immune cell subsets and only macrophage deletion of Chat ablated induction of acetylcholine production and rendered thermogenic defects in inguinal fat upon cold exposure. Preliminary studies with pharmacological activation using agonists in genetic models including single knockouts of subtype of the b-ARs (adrenergic receptors), suggested that these ChAT+ macrophages are mediated through β2-AR. Aim 1. We will thoroughly investigate how these cholinergic macrophages are activated using both cultured macrophages (BMDM) and adipose resident macrophages in a double reporter mouse line (ChAT-Cre;tdTomato;ChATBAC-eGFP). Spatial distribution of ChAT+ cells in vivo will be visualized in Adipo-Clear prepared subcutaneous fat and single cell RNA-seq will be carried out to characterize the transcriptome landscape of these cells. Aim 2. We will investigate how Ca2+ influx influences CHRNA2 downstream signaling in activated beige adipocytes. Preliminary results indicated that newly generated Chrna2HA-Cre knockin mice may provide a functional beige selective Cre system for the field. We also propose to characterize the composition of the CHRNA2-containing ion channel complex in beige fat using this mouse model. Aim 3. We will investigate how acetylcholine-CHRNA2 signaling is affected throughout the development of obesity. We propose to study how CHRNA2 mediated beige fat activation contributes to the adaptive response to streptozotocin-induced loss of glycemic control. All required tools and genetic models are at hand and have been
validated. Conditions for key experiments have been optimized. A team of collaborators have been recruited to carry out proposed studies with interdisciplinary approaches. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms underlying this circuitry will lead us to new molecular and cellular candidates counteracting human metabolic disorders."
10813832,"ABSTRACT
MYC oncoproteins (including c-MYC, L-MYC and N-MYC) play critical roles in the initiation, progression and
recurrence of many human malignancies. Extensive studies indicate that MYC is required to maintain tumor cell
survival and proliferation. We have recently used a novel approach that combined computer-aided modeling with
a rapid in vivo screen to develop a new series of direct small molecule inhibitors (MYCi’s) that show excellent
selectivity, potency and tolerability in multiple MYC-driven cancer models. These compounds demonstrate a
dual mechanism of action. First, direct binding of MYCi to MYC in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) region
disrupts complex formation with MYC which is required for MYC transcriptional activity. Secondly, binding of
MYCi enhances MYC phosphorylation on threonine-58 (pT58) which promotes MYC degradation via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However the key downstream effectors of these events and how they might
impact cellular function are unknown. Reduction of MYC protein and enhanced pT58MYC may be expected to
have profound effects on MYC family protein interactions with each other and with chromatin. In this regard, we
have observed in preliminary studies that MYCi leads to selective loss of MYC at genomic loci enriched for
master chromatin regulators (CTCF and FOX), suggesting disruption of the 3D architecture of the MYC-bound
genome in response to MYCi. Additionally, unfolded MYC due to MYCi binding and/or enhanced MYC
degradation may provoke a cellular stress response. Using unbiased ATAC-seq and RNA-seq approaches, we
found that MYCi treatment activates the ATF4/CHOP stress response pathway. Importantly, activation of
ATF4/CHOP by MYCi is an on-target, MYC-dependent effect. ATF4 mediates MYCi antitumor activity as ATF4
depletion partially ameliorates the antitumor effects of MYCi. Furthermore, we propose that MYCi-induced ATF4
cytokines modulate the tumor microenvironment. Activation of the ATF4 pathway by MYCi exposes potential
therapeutic vulnerabilities for rational combination approaches, such as combination of MYCi with proteasome
inhibitors that activates ATF4. Based on the preliminary findings, our central hypotheses is that MYCi inhibits
MYC-dependent tumorigenesis by a dual-pronged mode of action. First, MYCi affects MYC family target gene
expression by disrupting MYC/MAX interaction and by promoting MYC degradation. Secondly, binding of MYCi
to MYC and/or MYC degradation activates an ATF4/CHOP stress response pathway that suppresses tumor cell
viability. We propose the following specific aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1). To investigate the mechanisms
by which MYC inhibitor modulates MYC transcriptional activity and the epigenetic landscape. We will investigate
the consequences of MYCi treatment on the recruitment of MYC, pT58MYC, and associated factors to chromatin;
changes to 3D chromatin architecture; as well as the effects on MYC-driven transcriptional output in tumor cells
vitro and in vivo. Aim 2). To define the mechanisms and functional consequences of ATF4/CHOP pathway
activation by MYCi. We will determine mechanism of ARF4 upregulation by MYCi; define the role of MYCi-
induced ATF4 in regulating target gene expression, cell viability and tumorigenicity; and assess strategies that
exploit the consequences of ATF4 activation as a means of enhancing MYCi anti-tumor efficacy.
These studies are significant as MYC is implicated in the majority of human cancers. The studies advance the
use of MYCi as chemical probes to unmask distinct biology that complements the knowledge derived from
genetic manipulations of MYC proteins. The findings will contribute to the efforts aimed at developing small
molecule MYCi as potential therapeutics. Specifically, this work indicates that small-molecule MYC inhibitors
have an additional anti-tumor effect due to the activation of the ATF4 pathway beyond the antitumor effects of
suppressing MYC function. Finally, understanding this on-target ATF4 response provoked by small-molecule
MYCi will provide rational strategies for combination therapy to enhance MYCi efficacy."
10796966,"Under conditions of energy excess, fatty acids not utilized by the body are normally stored in white adipocytes,
where they can be released and used for fuel under energy depletion by other organs. In obesity, adipocyte
enlargement (hypertrophy) in white adipose tissue (AT) leads to a reduced ability of AT to contain triglycerides,
causing lipid deposition in other organs, which leads to insulin resistance (IR), and type-2 diabetes (T2D)
development. Obesity does not cause T2D if AT is well vascularized and composed of small white adipocytes
and mitochondria-rich beige adipocytes, indicating that AT hyperplasia is the key to metabolic health. Adipocytes
undergo turnover throughout aging and their pools in AT are maintained by heterogeneous adipose progenitor
cells (APCs) that divide, self-renew and differentiate into preadipocytes to replace dying adipocytes in AT. Our
preliminary data show that APC proliferation is under circadian control that is dysregulated upon high fat-diet
feeding. PDGF receptors, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, which signal to direct APC differentiation into beige or white
adipocytes, respectively, appear to mediate this diurnal proliferation. Clinical data linking telomere shortening in
AT with T2D development suggests that sustained ability of APCs to divide and give rise to new adipocytes,
rather than reliance on the expansion of previously existing large, white adipocytes, explains the lack of T2D
development in “healthy obese” individuals. This proposal is based on preliminary data showing that the long-
term outcome of replicative APC senescence and depletion is adipocyte hypertrophy and AT fibrosis, resulting
in metabolic dysfunction. Our overarching hypothesis is that APC over-proliferation in AT, aggravated by diet-
induced obesity and disruption of circadian mitogenic signaling, accelerates APC replicative senescence, leading
to AT metabolic dysfunction and 2TD. Here we will use genetic mouse models to analyze and manipulate APCs
regulated by PDGF-A / Pdgfrα, signaling, which are skewed toward beige adipogenesis, and APCs regulated by
PDGF-D / Pdgfrβ , which are skewed toward white adipogenesis. Using mouse models of accelerated telomere
shortening, we will establish the consequences of replicative senescence of white and beige preadipocytes on
AT and integrative physiology. In Aim 2, using mouse models of circadian dysregulation, we will investigate the
mechanisms controlling white and beige adipocyte progenitor proliferation and determine the effect of circadian
disruption in APC on AT function. In Aim 3, we will test approaches to nutritional control of white and beige APC
exhaustion and metabolic dysfunction. Effects of dietary interventions on mitogenic signaling, APC proliferation,
telomere shortening, white / beige adipocyte pools and metabolism will be analyzed. An innovation of this study
is a mechanistic explanation to how depletion of APC populations in distinct AT depots due to metabolic
disbalance predisposes to metabolic dysfunction. Establishing nutritional approaches to normalizing APC
proliferation will have a translational impact in the field of obesity, diabetes, and aging."

Our lab works at the intersection of immunology, stem cell biology and regeneration, and the grants
funding this work (GM123267 and GM 123255) which we are requesting to merge in the MIRA program
have provided numerous insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying both self/non-self
recognition, as well as a genetically determined cell competition event that occurs between mobile
germline stem cells for niche occupancy. In addition, we have recently found that these same germline
stem cells, which are lineage restricted under normal conditions, are responsible for a regenerative
response to injury called Whole Body Regeneration, during which entire bodies, including all
cardiovascular, GI, central and peripheral nervous, endocrine and germline tissues are regenerated de
novo from isolated vascular fragments, and we propose to extend our research efforts into this robust
model system of chordate regeneration. As described in the proposal, in the last 18 months, these
studies have led to a number of exciting findings we will follow-up on during the upcoming funding
period, including: dissecting the molecular basis for allorecognition specificity and its conservation with
vertebrate immunity; a novel mechanism of autocrine stimulation that is required for homing of germline
stem cells and likely plays a role in the competitive phenotype; and rescue and lineage tracing assays
for whole body regeneration that have revealed that a single germline stem cell can give rise to an
entire body- a result which may have major implications for understanding germ cell tumors, and also
provides a unique opportunity for rapidly creating genetically modified lines of Botryllus. Our long-term
goals are to utilize the unique biological properties of Botryllus to carry out innovative molecular
mechanistic studies, and a MIRA award would allow us to redirect our efforts from funding to carrying
out more and better innovative research on these biomedically important topics."

Synthetic nucleobase and nucleoside analogs (NNA) represent an important class of therapeutic agents with a
variety range of indications, with 41 NNA drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
anti-cancer and/or anti-viral therapy. However, most NNA drugs are associated severe adverse effects that can
be life-threatening, and there is a wide inter-patient variability in their pharmacologic effects. Therefore, there is
a pressing need to understand the biological basis of the variance in NNA drug toxicity and response, to
develop ways to more safely and more effectively use this important class of drugs.
To address these challenges, our NIGMS-funded work in the past 5 years focused on pharmacogenetics of
thiopurines, an NNA drug widely used to treat leukemia and autoimmune diseases. We discovered genetic
variants in a novel drug metabolism gene NUDT15 associated with severe myelosuppression during thiopurine
treatment in children with leukemia, elucidated the pharmacological mechanism by which NUDT15 modulates
thiopurine cytotoxicity, systematically identified pharmacogenetic variants in NUDT15, and also led the
development of clinical guides for NUDT15-guided thiopurine dosing. More recently, we have identified two anti-
viral drugs, namely acyclovir and ganciclovir, as novel substrates of NUDT15, indicating that NUDT15 can
promiscuously metabolize a variety of NNA drugs. In fact, NUDT15 belongs to a large class of human NUDIX
enzymes that dephosphorylate native or chemically modified nucleotides.
Based on these findings, I hypothesize that NUDIX enzymes (including NUDT15) are potentially important
metabolizing enzymes for NNA drugs, primarily by regulating dephosphorylation of nucleotide drug metabolite.
To this end, I plan to rationally expand my research program to study pharmacogenetics of NNA drugs broadly,
with the overarching objectives to identify novel pharmacogenetic markers for NNA drug response and then
use this information to develop approaches for genetics-guided treatment individualization. In the next funding
cycle, I will pursue research in two distinctive but related directions: 1) to identify NUDT15 variants associated
with ganciclovir drug inactivation and develop NUDT15 genotype-guided approaches to individualize anti-viral
therapy, and 2) to broadly examine human NUDIX enzymes for their role in the activity of NNA drugs, focusing
on 14 FDA-approved anti-cancer agents.
Given the large number of NNA drugs used clinically and the pressing need to use NNA drugs more safely and
effectively, my research program addresses a significant scientific challenge and is substantive in scope and
appropriate for long-term pursuit. I am confident that sustained progress in the next funding cycle is likely with
continuation of the NIGMS support."
10775729,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the deadliest cancers with a survival rate of 11% due to its
aggressive nature and resistance to therapies. While nearly all PDA cases are driven by mutations in the
KRAS gene, efforts to target KRAS or its effectors (e.g., MEK and ERK) are met with adaptive resistance.
Pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs), a subpopulation of transcriptionally-plastic cancer cells that are
especially drug resistant and particularly tumorigenic, are a critical component of the aggressive and therapy-
resistant nature of PDA. There are currently no strategies to target PCSCs, as well as a lack of information
regarding their drivers. We previously identified HNF1A, a gastrointestinal-lineage transcription factor, as a
novel master regulator of the PCSC state. Our preliminary data show that HNF1A expression can be potently
blocked by BET-inhibitors (BETi), a class of drugs which inhibit the epigenetic reader protein BRD4.
Interestingly, re-expression of HNF1A rescues cell cycle progression and PCSC-properties in BETi-treated
PDA cells, suggesting that HNF1A is a novel and critical target for these drugs. We have also found that
HNF1A is a novel driver of resistance to targeting KRAS and downstream MEK/ERK-signaling. Importantly, the
use of BETi in combination with MEK- and ERK-inhibitors (MEKi/ERKi) increases growth arrest and cell death
in an HNF1A-dependent manner. We hypothesize that HNF1A is directly regulated by BRD4, and is therefore
targetable with BETi, and that the inhibition of HNF1A expression with BETi will nullify HNF1A-dependent
PCSCs and adaptive resistance to KRAS-ablation. In this proposal, we aim to characterize the regulation of
HNF1A and its role in therapeutic response and resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the
regulation of HNF1A by BETi-target BRD4. Specific Aim 1 will combine genetic manipulation of BRD4, ChIP-
PCR, and reporter assays to demonstrate regulation of HNF1A by BRD4. Re-expression of HNF1A in BRD4-
depleted cells will 1) define the role of HNF1A in BRD4-mediated cell growth and survival in vitro and in vivo,
as well as 2) determine the contribution of HNF1A to the BRD4 transcriptome using RNA-seq/ChIP-seq to
identify how HNF1A determines response to BETi. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish BETi as a means to
overcome HNF1A-mediated resistance to KRAS-ablation. Specific Aim 2 will use PDA cells with and without
ectopic HNF1A expression to examine the contribution of HNF1A to BETi and KRAS-pathway inhibitor activity;
we will utilize in vitro and in vivo assays to examine how these drugs affect PCSCs and use RNA-seq/ChIP-
seq to determine how HNF1A promotes resistance to targeting KRAS-signaling. Both aims will utilize next-
generation bromodomain-selective inhibitors that have not been explored in PDA or combinatorial therapies.
The completion of the above studies will dramatically improve our understanding of PDA biology and uncover
novel therapeutic targets. By improving our understanding of resistance to KRAS suppression and expanding
the therapeutic spectrum of PDA to include PCSCs, more effective treatment of PDA can be achieved."

10799612,"INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY CORE
ABSTRACT
The Integrative Environmental Health Sciences Facility Core (IEHS-FC) acts as the navigator for EDGE
Center interdisciplinary research. Here, investigators and trainees connect to Center services and a
comprehensive consultation resource emphasizing clinical, translational, and population-based studies. The
IEHS-FC facilitates Center member research along the translational continuum. Whether the investigator is
involved in basic or experimental sciences, clinical studies or observational population-based studies, the
IEHS-FC offers high quality advisement, methods, and resources to enhance EHS research, inform public
health policy and practice, and impact individual and population health. The IEHS-FC fosters
interdisciplinary team science research throughout the University of Washington by integrating basic
sciences research with population-based and clinical EHS research to improve early detection and prevention
of environmentally related disorders. The Core also helps to identify collaborative opportunities within the
greater NIEHS Core Centers program by promoting and connecting researchers to respond to the EHS Core
Centers collaborative research funding opportunities.
The IEHS-FC is re-structured with two focus areas in addition to the navigator function. The clinical,
translational, and population-based studies focus area remains. Investigators will continue to benefit from
services covering study design and execution, clinical and physiological testing, collection and storage of
human samples, access to controlled-human exposure facilities, and identifying patient groups and sample
repositories. In this renewal, new resources are added to support translational research to address emerging
needs in Disaster Research Response (DR2), an emerging focus of the Center. This second focus area
supports investigators in the conduct of rigorous, timely, ethical, and safe environmental health disaster
research response. The IEHS-FC is the gateway for EDGE Center investigators, fostering interdisciplinary and
novel EHS research. Its emphasis on clinical and translational sciences, individual susceptibility factors, and
gene-environment interactions are in keeping with the goals of NIEHS to maximize the utilization of human
population-based studies in EHS research. By offering expert consultation, research services and appropriate
referrals to EDGE Center investigators, the IEHS-FC enhances the interconnectedness of the EDGE
Center Facility Cores, the Community Engagement Core (CEC), and other EDGE Center components.
By leveraging the outstanding resources of the EDGE Center, the Department of Environmental &
Occupational Health Sciences, the School of Public Health and the broader UW biomedical research
community, the IEHS-FC provides an important and valued hub for NIEHS funded investigators at the UW,
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the Center’s
community partners, and the local, regional, and national EHS research community."

CORE (GBBM-FC) ABSTRACT
It is well established that chemical exposures to biological systems result in expression changes of numerous
RNA and protein molecules and these changes are correlated with, and can be indicative of toxicity. In
addition, many molecular epidemiologic studies have identified correlations between genetic polymorphisms
and the incidence of environmentally-related diseases. Toxicological monitoring increasingly involves the
assessment of genetic and other molecular measurements derived from human individuals and animal models,
to detect markers of disease susceptibility and to identify early indicators of chemical effect. Various targeted
molecular methods as well as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics
approaches have been developed in recent years and continue to develop rapidly. These methods
complement each other and allow for mechanistic investigations of entire biological pathways and networks, as
well as their individual components. The optimal application of these state-of-the-art methodologies requires
considerable expertise in a) sample preparation and processing, b) generation and quality assessment of the
data, c) rigorous statistical and bioinformatics analysis, d) as well as interpretation of the complex data. Most
investigators do not possess the financial resources or specialized expertise to keep up with the rapid
technological advancements in these areas. However, it is critical for investigators to have access to the latest
technologies in order to be competitive and to perform cutting-edge research. The Core addresses these
challenges by providing access to the necessary expertise in OMICs-based methods that support
environmental health sciences research. The Core also provides access to sophisticated in vitro systems that
mimic complex tissue architecture and provide platforms to investigate organ-like physiology in the context of
toxicological perturbations. The primary goal of the Core is to empower Center affiliates to integrate
state-of-the-art genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics technologies,
as well as microphysiological in vitro systems into their Environmental Health Sciences research in a
cost-effective manner."
10795095,"Our central goal is to determine neuroprotective mechanism conferred by microglia and autophagy, and
understand how dysfunctional autophagy in microglia contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
(AD). Emerging evidence from human genetic and pathological studies has demonstrated the significance of
microglia pathophysiology in the pathogenesis of AD. Microglia are the resident innate immune cells in the
brain. The exact role for microglia in AD pathogenesis, however, remains poorly understood. Multiple lines of
studies revealed the protective function of microglia that restrain the toxic accumulation of β-amyloid and
prevent disease progression. However, evidence also exists suggesting excessive microglial activation can
harm the neurons by releasing inflammatory factors and engulfing neuronal synapses. Microglia may
phagocytose Aβ, the main component of plaques as a hallmark of AD pathology; single-cell RNAseq analysis
showed the disease-associated microglia (DAM), which localizes at plaques in AD animal models, consistent
with a role of TREM2 as a critical regulator of DAM activation. Autophagy is a lysosome clearance pathway
that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis under metabolic stress and neuroprotection. Little is
known about glial autophagy. Previous studies from peripheral immune cells demonstrate a significant role of
autophagy in immunity and inflammation. Whether microglial autophagy plays such a role, however, remains
poorly understood. We recently analyzed AD mouse model and observed the activation of microglial
autophagy. We found that DAM is associated with a robust increase of autophagic activity. We also showed
that inactivation of microglial autophagy causes reduced number of microglia associated with Aβ plagues and
enhanced neurotoxicity in AD models, which phenocopied the effect of the loss of Trem2 in AD models.
Therefore, our overall hypothesis is that autophagy activation is required for DAM metabolic fitness to degrade
Aβ and protect neurons in the AD brains. We also hypothesize that microglial autophagy controls inflammation
by selective degradation of inflammasomes via protein receptors that are neuroprotective in AD. Our specific
aims are to (1) determine the role for microglial autophagy in neuroprotection by clearing phagocytosed Aβ and
maintaining metabolic fitness in AD mouse models; (2) dissect the mechanism of microglial autophagy that
controls inflammation in AD mouse model; (3) determine that autophagy is an integral part of TREM2-mediated
neuroprotection mechanism in microglia of AD mouse model."
10755748,"Project Summary
Collectively, rare diseases affect ~350 million people in the world, and most of them lack specific treatments
resulting in a tremendous unmet medical need. Understanding the underlying genetic and molecular
mechanisms and developing therapies for rare diseases are essential for our efforts to address this urgent
need. The present application focuses on understanding and treating Usher syndrome (Usher), a rare disease
characterized by multisensory loss (hearing, vision, and balance) that creates a major communication and
mobility burden affecting all aspects of life. Currently, there are no treatments to prevent or slow the
progression of Usher. To fill these important gaps, we propose three aims in this collaborative project to
determine the progression of vestibular dysfunction over time in the knock-in mouse model for the most
common type 1 Usher mutation in the Acadian populations of Louisiana and Canada (USH1C c.216G>A) (Aim
1) and in a cohort of pediatric, young adult, and adult USH1C patients (Aim 3), and to test the therapeutic
efficacies of antisense and gene replacement therapies when delivered at different stages of disease
progression in the USH1C mice (Aim 2). These aims are driven by the central hypothesis that USH1C-related
vestibular dysfunction progresses over time and is end-organ specific, which is supported by our strong
preliminary studies that show age-dependent declines of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes, and progressive
saccular hair cell degeneration in USH1C mice. In Aim 1, we will employ a combination of molecular, structural,
single vestibular afferent neurophysiology, and behavioral biomarkers to define the progression of vestibular
dysfunction in USH1C mice over a 1-year time course. In Aim 2, we will continue studies to restoring vestibular
function in neonatal USH1C mice using the antisense and gene replacement therapies and further test their
effectiveness when delivered at various stages of disease progression. In parallel, in Aim 3, we will define the
natural history of vestibular dysfunction in a cohort of 50 USH1C patients by testing their vestibular function at
baseline and 6 months later. These results will fill the important gaps in understanding and treating Usher
disease and allow us to define the clinical outcome measures for future clinical trials. Results from this
collaborative project will identify lead clinical drug candidates, an optimal treatment regimen for restoring
vestibular function in USH1C mice, and define measurable clinical outcomes to guide a first-in-human study of
a treatment for vestibular dysfunction in USH1C."
10850689,"Abstract/Summary
Chemotherapy and radiation can induce breast tumors to enter a prolonged state of growth arrest with
characteristics of senescence. A senescent-like state is also characteristic of residual tumor cells that survive
after chemotherapy and/or radiation have eliminated the bulk of a tumor cell population. Tumor cells surviving
therapy-induced senescence have the capacity to recover proliferative capacity subsequent to their prolonged
growth arrest. Recovery and re-emergence of tumor cells from this growth-arrested state could contribute to
disease recurrence months or years after the patient has apparently been cured of the primary disease.
 Several agents have recently been identified as having senolytic properties [e.g. ABT-263 (navitoclax)]
which can selectively kill senescent cells. Given that disease recurrence and consequent cancer mortality is
frequently associated with the re-emergence of proliferative tumor cells either at the primary disease site or
metastatic sites, a primary goal of this project will be to test the hypothesis that senolytic agents can eliminate
therapy induced senescent breast tumor cells to prevent, or at least significantly suppress, cancer recurrence.
 Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that the senolytic agent, ABT-263, can efficiently eliminate cells
induced into senescence by chemotherapy or radiation when used sequentially (and potentially, repeatedly) after
the initial therapy. Sensitivity to senolytics will be assessed in senescence-sorted breast tumor cells, prior to
senescence and during the course of recovery, and in residual populations surviving after the bulk of the tumor
population has been eliminated by therapeutic agents. The effectiveness of a sequential treatment schedule will
also be assessed in vivo using xenograft and PDX tumor models.
 Aim 2 will interrogate the mechanisms whereby the senolytic ABT-263 promotes cell death in senescent
breast tumor cells, with a focus on the contributions of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins.
 Aim 3 will examine the immune response to therapy-induced senescent cells alone and after treatment
with senolytics. A phenotypic assessment of tumor infiltrating immune cells and studies with selective immune
cell depletion in mouse models will define the nature (adaptive and innate) of the antitumor immune response.
Ex vivo studies will further determine NK- and T cell-mediated lysis of senescent cells in the absence or presence
of ABT-263. The ability of senolytics to induce immunogenic cell death will be a focus. Toxicity to the host will
be compared for exposure to senolytics concomitant with chemotherapy (i.e. prior to entry into senescence) and
subsequent to induction of senescence."
10814802,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is both impactful on a societal and
individual basis. Better treatments are needed for our Veterans, and methodological
advancements can facilitate progress in the understanding and treatment of PTSD.
 With the dramatically reduced cost of collection and analysis of DNA there is
now many large repositories that contain relatively comprehensive genetic data.
Furthermore, on the individual level, many Veterans have genetic data available
through commercial (e.g., 23 and Me) or research (e.g., the Million Veteran Program)
entities. It is possible that access to their own genetic data will allow people to leverage
the latest research developments in the aims of receiving state-of-the-art personalized
medicine. New algorithmic advances can allow this data to be utilized for improving
our understanding of conditions, such as PTSD. Machine learning provides a way to
better identify those with PTSD through methods such as boosted trees or deep learning
models. Clustering techniques can provide a way to clarify homogenous subgroups
within Veteran samples.
 This project looks to take a supervised (aka, classification) and unsupervised
(aka, clustering) analytical approach to better understand PTSD using genetic and
neuroimaging data from publicly available data repositories. For this work, features are
selected based on the latest advancements in the literature and models are selected
through rigorous empirical evaluation. Treatment for PTSD, and other disorders, is
potentially limited by classifications that are based on symptom reports such as used in
DSM. This traditional approach creates biologically heterogeneous samples. We
propose applying advanced analytical tools to empirically derived biomarkers to create
homogeneous biologically-based groupings."

This Tribal Community-Engaged project uses spatial and legal epidemiological methods within community
participatory frameworks to assess the differential relationships of state and tribal alcohol policies to alcohol-
related health risks for residents of American Indian reservations. We propose to compile and summarize
alcohol regulatory policies established by sovereign tribal nations in conjunction with extant alcohol policies of
the U.S. states with which they are collocated. Many correlates of the high rates of alcohol-related problems
observed among American Indians (AI) compared to other U.S. populations have been extensively addressed
in individual social-behavioral studies in, for example, genetics, psychology, and community health. Very few
studies have considered contrasting state vs. tribal alcohol policies as social-structural determinants that may
be related to AI alcohol related problems. Sovereign tribal nations have the right to establish their own alcohol
policies, which may vary according to adjacent state policy conditions and attitudes towards alcohol across
tribal communities. Tribal alcohol policies are publicly registered, but there has been no common repository nor
systematic typology established that allows researchers to characterize these ordinances and relate them to
state alcohol conditions (see, e.g. NIAAA’s Alcohol Policy Information System). Prior studies of tribal alcohol
policies were not able to consider the full impacts of collocated state alcohol regulatory conditions on tribal
alcohol problems. Recent studies have developed an Alcohol Policy Score (APS) that characterizes the
strengths of alcohol policies across U.S. states. The APS may now be applied to studies of tribal alcohol
regulatory conditions. Cross-site studies of tribal alcohol outcomes have also been hampered by the use of
heterogenous data systems. We demonstrate that hospitalization records and motor vehicle crash data
collected in similar ways across U.S. states can be used to assess tribal alcohol outcomes using common data
frames and advanced spatial epidemiological methods. Finally, analyses of tribal policies will be limited in
interpretive scope without obtaining local insights and knowledge of tribal leaders who have designed, enacted,
and are charged with enforcing tribal alcohol ordinances. We use Tribal Community-Based Participatory and
qualitative research methods at multiple levels of community engagement (Tribal Community Advisory Board;
tribal research review; Tribal Key Leader Interview; Tribal and Local Law Enforcement Survey) to assess how
tribal and state alcohol policies are effected on tribal lands and may support or reduce alcohol-related risks for
residents of tribal nations. Our engagement plans ensure tribal community oversight of the interpretation of
findings, and dissemination of results to tribal leaders as well as scientific communities."

Implementation science is the domain of scholarship that studies methods to facilitate the spread and adoption
of evidence-based practices into real-world settings. The field has seen tremendous growth in the last decade.
Yet, a critical gap impeding further growth is the lack of rigorous training opportunities for young investigators.
Hence the objective of this proposed program is to launch the first T32 program dedicated to implementation
science training to improve heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) health promotion and clinical practice. We
seek applications from MDs, PhDs, and predoctoral candidates, from a wide range of clinical and scientific
disciplines, and diverse personal backgrounds. The proposed program will take full advantage of the stellar
resources of two new centers at Yale: the Yale Center for Implementation Science (YCIS), based at the School
of Medicine, and the Center for Methods in Implementation and Prevention Science (CMIPS), based at the
School of Public Health. The program’s aims are to: [1] Develop scientists with the knowledge, skills, and
ability to become independent investigators who will continue to expand the field; [2] build a cadre of
investigators/leaders who collaborate with stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, and public health
professionals, from inception through dissemination of research results, with the goal of promoting the uptake
of findings in practice and policy. [3] Enhance the diversity of the implementation science workforce. This
proposal has 4 distinguishing characteristics: (1) Integration with an NHLBI-supported K12 program that serves
as the training core of YCIS; (2) Mentors and resources representing an extraordinary breadth of disciplines
from a wide array of schools at Yale, including Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, and Management, with
expertise in implementation science, organizational behavior, study design, and (HLBS) health promotion and
medical care; (3) Intense engagement with the broader New Haven community, including the Department of
Health, federally qualified health centers, and local nonprofit groups, and (4) A novel use of social network
modeling to assess the professional development and progress of T32 trainees. Our initial cohort of K12
scholars have secured NIH, foundation, and industry grants, and averaged 4 papers/year each, attesting to the
rigor of our training. Didactic components leverage coursework developed by YCIS and CMIPS, and additional
Yale programs that have trained generations of scientists in clinical investigation and public health research
methods. A research practicum will offer close mentorship from national and international experts in HLBS
medicine. Eligible trainees will receive a PhD or Masters in Health Science degree, depending on professional
needs. Training duration will be 2-3 years, based on needs. We will have 3-7 slots per year. Successful
candidates must show evidence of a strong commitment to implementation science, academic excellence in
fields of previous academic training, and a commitment to work with stakeholders as partners. Trainee
progress will be monitored and evaluated by the Program Directors, mentors, and an Advisory Committee."
10783728,"ABSTRACT
Chronic pancreatitis (CP), a painful, debilitating disorder of the exocrine pancreas, lacks treatments and
strategies to prevent disease progression. Alcohol abuse and smoking are common causes of CP but the
mechanisms underlying their toxic effects on the pancreas are unclear. Recently, adaptive mechanisms that
prevent pancreatitis with stressors such as alcohol were identified in the pancreatic acinar cell. These adaptive
mechanisms involve the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and the UPR
transcription factor, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) that upregulates ER chaperones, ER transporters, and
quality control machinery to maintain ER function. Our previous work showed that alcohol administration
induces oxidative stress but also upregulates XBP1s and a protective UPR that prevents pathology, while
smoking inhibits alcohol induced XBP1s formation, and upregulates a pathologic UPR signal mediated by
C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) resulting in ER dysfunction and pancreatitis. This project investigates
molecular determinants of pancreatitis associated with alcohol abuse, smoking and perturbed ER protein
folding and trafficking. Reversible Nε-lysine acetylation regulates the efficiency of ER protein transit to Golgi
and the secretory pathway. Acetylation of properly folded proteins enables ER-to-Golgi exit, while non-
acetylated, misfolded proteins divert to protein degradation systems. Thus, disruption of ER protein acetylation
perturbs ER function and protein trafficking. The acetyl CoA transporter, AT-1 mediates ER entry of acetyl
CoA from cytoplasm to provide substrate for acetylation. In humans, the AT-1-S113R mutant reduces AT-1
transport capacity, and individuals with this mutant exhibit neurodegenerative disorders. We found that XBP1s
regulates AT-1 levels in acinar cells. Moreover, AT-1S113r/+ or acinar-specific AT-1 deficient mice develop mild/
moderate CP and chronic ER stress with elevated XBP1s. Strikingly, AP induction in these mice decreases
XBP1s levels and markedly exacerbates CP progression. Our results indicate AT-1 and XBP1s are
interdependent and important for pancreas adaption in response to alcohol but when overwhelmed by
environmental stressors these adaptive systems fail leading to pathology. Our overarching hypothesis is
that chronic acinar cell stress and reduced XBP1s protective programs by drinking/smoking attenuate
AT-1 expression, disrupting ER acetylation and ER function, and inducing severe CP. Using
experimental models of alcoholic + smoking CP, we will pursue 3 aims. Aim 1 will test whether alcohol
consumption/smoking converts mild/moderate CP into severe disease in acinar-specific AT-1 KO mice. Aim 2
will evaluate whether enhanced XBP1s expression or CHOP genetic deletion partially mitigates CP severity in
AT-1 KO mice. Aim 3 will investigate ER acetylation pathway regulation of ER protein folding and trafficking as
well as ER protein degradation. We expect this project to provide insights into the pathways driving CP
development, and pinpoint molecular targets for strategies to halt CP progression."
10820537,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cell and Tissue Imaging Core
 Advanced cellular microscopy is a powerful tool for biological research and plays an important role in
the study of the pathogenesis and eventual treatment of diabetes mellitus. Imaging technology has evolved
rapidly over the last decade leading to improvements in resolution, sensitivity and speed that have created new
opportunities for studying processes across many orders of magnitude and in real-time in living cells and
animals. However, the costs of increasingly sophisticated equipment are substantial and the expertise to
efficiently use, maintain, and develop this equipment is not common in most labs. There is therefore a
significant gap between the availability of these powerful tools and the ability of investigators to access and use
them efficiently. The Cell and Tissue Imaging Core was established in response to feedback from DRC center
members to leverage the significant institutional investment in the newly created Washington University Center
for Cellular Imaging (WUCCI) by providing an integrated approach to investigate the structure and dynamic
behavior of diabetes-related cells and tissues. The overall objective of the Core is to provide access to
and technical support in using advanced cellular microscopy to accelerate the pace, expand the scope,
and improve the efficiency of diabetes research at Washington University. Core services meet the unique
requirements of numerous investigators over a wide range of basic and translational research and attract new
investigators into diabetes research. Importantly, users benefit from the in-depth diabetes and technical
expertise of the Core directors and technical staff in time spent in consultation for experimental design and
interpretation of data. During the past funding cycle, the Core served 67 DRC investigator research
laboratories (including 14 P&F recipients), who expensed $788,342 in core recharges, representing
approximately 18% of all WUCCI activity. Eighteen DRC member laboratories received micro-grant funding
through the DRC Imaging Core Scholarship program. Ten of these labs were directed by junior faculty
members at the rank of Assistant Professor. Thirty-five publications used and cited core services. Given the
broad use of the Core over the past funding cycle, and the establishment of new imaging technologies (e.g.
cryo-EM and lattice lightsheet), sample preparation services (e.g. tissue clearing), and analysis approaches
(e.g. AI-based immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent image analysis), it is anticipated that requests for
Cell and Tissue Imaging Core services will continue to grow. The substantial demand by DRC members for
advanced microscopic imaging and image analysis is strong evidence that the Cell and Tissue Imaging Core
provides services that leverage generous institutional support and unique expertise to facilitate important and
innovative diabetes research."
10820542,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Diabetes Models Phenotyping Core
 The Diabetes Models Phenotyping (DMP) Core is an important component of the Washington
University Diabetes Research Center (DRC). The long-term goal of the DMP Core is to enhance diabetes-
related research at Washington University using sophisticated services and technologies with the potential to
contribute to discoveries that can be translated to novel treatments for diabetes and related disorders. The
DMP Core has three objectives: 1) To provide phenotyping services to DRC members to both facilitate
and enhance the cost-effectiveness of NIH-funded diabetes/metabolism-related research; 2) To provide
expert consultation and training to DRC members in experimental design and characterization of
mouse models relevant to diabetes, obesity and associated metabolic diseases; and 3) To develop new
research capabilities to enhance the ability of DRC members to perform diabetes and metabolic
research. The Core offers a broad range of animal phenotyping services, including a) body composition
analysis using EchoMRI and/or DEXA scan; b) indirect calorimetry to measure energy expenditure; c) glucose
and insulin tolerance testing; d) blood pressure determinations; and e) biochemical analyses of serum and
tissues to measure glucose, triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol. Meeting a key need in the diabetes
research community at Washington University, the Core provided services to 44 different DRC member
laboratories during the past funding period, including 11 P&F recipients. The services utilized by these
investigators over this time frame include biochemical assays of serum (>4,800 samples) and tissues (>1,100
samples), body composition determinations for >8500 mice, and indirect calorimetry assessments in >2,400
mice, to mention the services in greatest demand. These analyses supported the publication of 130 papers.
The Core continually evolves in response to user needs through elimination of some services and addition of
others. New and expanded services include hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, thermogenic phenotyping,
and expanded training and consultation. Together, DMP Core services continue to help DRC investigators
contribute important scholarly advances with substantial potential for translation to improved care for patients
suffering from diabetes and related complications."

 Long-term protection from viral infections is mediated by both the humoral and cellular immune pathways.
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy in the US and is characterized
by clonal plasma cell production, resulting in immune suppression and recurrent bacterial and viral infections.
 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody quantification are currently being used as clinical endpoints to determine
immune protection against COVID-19, and this information is even more relevant in immunocompromised
individuals who lack a humoral response, but are protected by the cellular immunity (i.e. MM patients).
 Despite the urgent need to quantify cellular immunity, the complexity and lack of scalability of traditional
methods (e.g. ELISpot, flow cytometry) to detect antigen-specific T cells has so far prevented large scale studies.
 To address this problem, we developed a direct qPCR-based rapid T cell activation (dqTACT) assay based
on ex vivo stimulation of whole blood samples with a pool of viral peptides (i.e.immunodominant peptides
covering SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein),
SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T cells, and CXCL10,
followed by direct amplification of IFNG 𝛾 or IL2 which are produced by
 which is produced by monocytes and neutrophils in
,
response
to
T cell activation.
The overarching aim of this proposal is to develop and implement a qPCR method that can be used as a proxy
to measure the presence and functionality of antigen specific T cells in MM patients. Specifically, we hypothesize
that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells might be a biomarker of previous infection and of efficacy of vaccination
strategies, complementary to quantification of the humoral response.
 In the UH2 phase, we will define analytical sensitivity and specificity and establish cut-off/thresholds and
appropriate positive and quality controls, accuracy and false result rate by comparing the dqTACT assay with
the gold standard assays such as flow cytometry and ELISpot for measuring cellular immune responses.
 In the UH3 phase, we will test the presence and persistence of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in
convalescent and vaccinated myeloma patients. Well annotated patient populations will be used to define
sensitivity, specificity, and thresholds with response to clinical end-points, such as presence and persistence of
humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We will estimate the prevalence of the markers within vaccinated
myeloma patients. We will then extend our studies and use banked as well as fresh samples from our large
myeloma/immunocompromised population and healthy controls enrolled in IRB approved studies.
 The overarching goal is to use the dqTACT assay to test the presence of T cells due to natural infection or
vaccination in myeloma patients, possibly aiding in nationwide booster strategies or passive antibody infusion
support to protect these vulnerable population.
 Key deliverables an assay to rapidly quantify the functionality of T cellular immunity at scale."

worldwide. The mortality rate is high (40%) for these infections despite treatment with antifungal therapies.
Similarly, methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause invasive and life-threatening
infections despite treatment with standard anti-infective therapies. Thus, persistence reflects host-pathogen
interactions occurring uniquely in context of antibiotic therapy in vivo. However, host factors and mechanisms
involved in persistent MRSA and HDC remain unclear. This study will use systems-based, high-throughput
multi-omics platforms and novel statistical and computational approaches to provide a comprehensive
longitudinal assessment of host in vitro and in vivo innate and adaptive responses to HDC and MRSA infection
using patient peripheral blood, stimulus specific PAMPs and patient-derived HDC plasma PAMPs and isolates.
Innovative deliverables include: i) Constructing an in-depth immune profile of HDC and MRSA immune profiles;
ii) understand the stimulus-specificity of de novo enhancer formation in macrophages and how they affect
transcriptional landscapes and functions iii) generate a detailed molecular map of the cross-talk between the
innate and adaptive immune response during HDC and MRSA infection; iv) using the combination of
biostatistics and computational modeling to explain and predict cellular and molecular networks driving trained
immunity and persistent, resolving, and survival outcomes; and v) identification and validation of druggable
epigenomic regulators of reprogramming. Detailed insights into the interaction of HDC and MRSA with the host
immune system stand to generate fundamentally new mechanistic hypotheses and diagnostic tools to guide
development of therapeutic strategies."

The long-term goal of our research is to understand how the sensory environment regulates animal behavior.
In this proposal, we will focus on investigating the genetic and neural basis of two sensory modalities:
thermosensation and osmosensation. The ability to sense temperature and osmolarity is essential for life.
Defects in thermosensation and osmosensation cause various neurological, renal and metabolic disorders. A
key player in thermosensation and osmosensation is the molecular sensory receptors that detect thermal and
osmotic cues. However, the molecular identities of cold-sensing receptors that sense cold temperatures are
poorly understood. Similarly, no osmolarity-sensing receptors have thus far been definitively identified in any
metazoan organisms. C. elegans is a popular genetic model organism widely used for the study of sensory
biology. To survive the harsh environment, C. elegans has evolved a rich repertoire of sensory systems. Like
mammals, C. elegans possesses the sense of temperature and osmolarity. Here, we propose to investigate
the genetic and neural mechanisms by which animals sense temperature, particularly cold temperature, as well
as osmolarity using C. elegans as a model. To do so, we will take a multifaceted approach that integrates
molecular genetics, behavioral analysis, laser ablation, whole-brain imaging, and electrophysiology. As the
mechanisms underlying thermosensation and osmosensation, particularly those involving sensory receptors,
tend to be evolutionarily conserved, the proposed work will provide novel insights into our understanding of
thermosensation and osmosensation in humans and their related neurological, renal and metabolic disorders."
10768604,"ABSTRACT
 Cellular rearrangements during tissue formation, tissue regeneration and cancer metastasis occur via
the coupled movement of groups of cells, a phenomenon known as collective cell migration. A key protein
involved in the collective migration of epithelial cells is E-cadherin (Ecad), an essential cell-cell adhesion protein.
Ecad adhesion is carefully regulated to orchestrate complex movement of cell monolayers and dysregulation of
adhesion is a characteristic of certain cancers. However, little is known about how Ecad structure and adhesion
are regulated and how this manifests in collective cell migration.
 The extracellular region of Ecad mediates adhesion, while its intracellular domain binds to regulatory
proteins such as p120-catenin, α-catenin and vinculin, which link Ecad to the actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesize
that α-catenin, vinculin and p120-catenin regulate adhesion by allosterically controlling the conformation of the
Ecad extracellular region. We also propose that some Ecad cancer mutations impede the inside-out regulation
of Ecad conformation and that understanding their mechanism of action will provide molecular insights into
adhesion regulation in tumorigenesis.
 In aim 1 of this proposal, we will assign distinct roles to α-catenin, p120-catenin, and vinculin binding in
modulating Ecad conformation and measure how cancer mutations impede inside-out regulation of adhesion. In
aim 2, we will establish how cytoplasmic proteins alter the conformation of the Ecad extracellular region by
building detailed structural models for intercellular junctions, with and without Ecad cancer mutations. Finally, in
aim 3, we will resolve the role of different Ecad conformations and cancer mutants on the migratory patterns of
epithelial cells.
 Our proposed research will provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of Ecad mediated adhesion
and resolve adhesive states that are important in epithelial tissue formation, wound healing, and cancer. This
knowledge will enable selective targeting and inhibition of specific Ecad structures, which can compromise
cancer progression."
10768575,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the major health issues for the aging Veterans population warranting
investigations to further advance knowledge of the disease pathobiology and benefit PCa patients, which accords
with the VA Healthcare mission. In this context, our focus has been centered on delineating the functions of the
pro-survival and cancer-addictive protein kinase CK2 in PCa pathobiology and therapy, resulting in significant
ground-breaking contributions over time. Protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase 2 or II) was originally
studied by us in relation to prostate biology, and CK2 is now recognized as one of the “master regulators” of
diverse functions in normal and malignant cells. Higher relative CK2 levels and activity correspond with
aggressive PCa disease, and CK2 proteins localize preferentially to the nucleus in PCa tumors. Crosstalk
between androgen receptor (AR), NFκB p65 and CK2 is demonstrated by us and others. Anti-CK2 treatments
cause loss of AR and NFκB p65, with cell death ensuing regardless of the androgen and drug sensitivity of PCa
cells. Currently, androgen deprivation therapy is the standard of care for many PCa patients; however, resistance
to androgen deprivation develops with progression from castration-sensitive to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).
Response to next generation anti-androgenic approaches (Abiraterone and/or Enzalutamide used ±
chemotherapy and more recently immunotherapy) is also temporary with development of resistance to these
therapies so that the mortality rates from metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) remain high. Thus, there is critical need
for identification of strategies to maintain drug response and prevent disease progression. Our new data show:
(1) PCa cells grown under multiple conditions that exert androgen pathway stress exhibit elevated CK2 levels;
(2) CK2 protein levels are higher in multiple PCa xenograft tumor models in castrated vs. testes-intact mice; (3)
CK2α mRNA is detected in pre-prostatectomy PCa patient serum, and the levels are significantly increased in
abiraterone-treated PCa patients serum; (4) High CK2 protein levels in tumors at prostatectomy correlate
significantly with faster progression to metastatic disease; and (5) Inhibition of CK2 kills Abiraterone- and
Enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells, and is synergistic with Abiraterone. These exciting novel observations prompt
the hypothesis that induction of CK2 and the subsequent impact on AR and NFκB pathways promotes therapy
resistance to current AR targeting therapies. We propose to determine molecular mechanisms involved in CK2
promotion of androgen pathway therapy resistance, and establish how CK2 functions as a driving factor for PCa
disease progression. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that suppression of CK2 activity will delay or
prevent PCa progression or reverse resistance to androgen pathway targeting, and is designed to examine the
effect and mechanism of the clinical grade anti-CK2 small molecule inhibitor CX-4945 on androgen pathway
drug resistance. We will employ mouse xenograft and PDX models that mimic PCa progression and CRPC
status. Specific aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that elevated CK2 under androgen stress will alter the proteomic
landscape related to suppression of cell death pathways and provide new insights into PCa progression. This
aim will involve determining the effects of increased CK2 levels on the nuclear proteomic and phospho-proteomic
composition of PCa cells under androgen stress, validation of proteomic changes and mechanistic pathways in
xenograft tumors (including PDX models) and PCa patient tissues, and investigation of the molecular
mechanism(s) by which CK2 levels increase under these conditions. Our novel direction in the proposed
investigation will generate knowledge that will set the stage for potential ground-breaking translation into the
clinic for PCa patients. Further, they will generate vital data about mechanisms that will explain how CK2
influences drug resistance and PCa cell survival, and elucidate regulatory functions of CK2 in PCa disease
progression through specific effects on the nuclear proteomic/phospho-proteomic landscape."
10768596,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy in adults and a major source of disability in
the veteran population as it is frequently caused by war-time head injuries. More than 1/3 of TLE patients do not
respond to anticonvulsant medications and many are not candidates for epilepsy surgery. Therefore, new
treatments are needed to prevent the development of epilepsy after the initial insult. Yet, the mechanisms that
lead to the development of epilepsy during the period directly after status epilepticus (SE) are still poorly
understood. A deep and precise understanding of these mechanisms is critical for development of interventions
that can treat temporal epilepsy without the side-effects of medications and potential disability from large surgical
resections. To determine the network dynamic changes in specific cell types during the earliest period after SE,
we have developed a miniaturized microscope that is completely integrated with a high channel
extracellular electrophysiology recording device (E-Scope). We hypothesize that hypersynchronous firing
of parvalbumin positive (PV+) and progressive decreased engagement of somatostatin+ (SOM+) interneurons
emerge during the epileptogenic period after the insult. We also hypothesize that these pathological circuit
dynamics in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons will be readily observed during 200-400 Hz high frequency
oscillations (HFOs) have been shown to be a biomarker for hyper-excitable epileptic circuit. In Aim 1 we will
measure how PV+ and SOM+ neurons become activated during pathological fast ripples and physiological
sharp-wave ripples through the epileptogenic period. In Aim 2, we will measure the precision of spatial coding
by excitatory neurons and the reactivation of ensembles during physiological sharp-wave ripples and
pathological fast ripples through the epileptogenic period. This information will be critical for identifying the cell
specific targets for interventions to prevent epileptogenesis. Overall Strategy: The overall goal of our
collaborative merit proposal is to determine the key changes in hippocampal and neocortical circuitry that
promotes the development of epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction after the initial insult. Aims of Other Proposals:
1. Wasterlain will use immunocytochemical techniques, including EM immunocytochemistry, to quantify changes
in the GABA receptor expression at the synapse and in the peri-synaptic space. 2. Naylor will use in-vitro slice
patch clamp recordings, optogenetics, and computational modeling to understand how the functional connectivity
of different interneuron types changes during this key period. 3. Smirnakis will use a combination of
electrophysiological techniques and in-vivo mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging to track the activity patterns
of neocortical neurons during this period, to understand how hippocampal-cortical communication changes and
drives the development of epilepsy. All studies are independent, yet deeply inform each other, as a multi-
dimensional understanding will be key for making progress in this highly complex and disabling disorder."
10809035,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting more than 32.5 million of US adults, with an
associated healthcare cost at more than $185 billion annually. Current treatments for osteoarthritis address
symptoms with limited disease-modifying potential. Inflammation is the key mediator of joint OA, making it the
key target for osteoarthritis treatment. However, available anti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroids, are rapidly
cleared from the joint. Fullerenes (C60) possess potent anti-inflammatory effects and are intrinsically superior to
steroids and other molecules due to their long-lasting activity and cell membrane-penetrating capability. We
recently developed a nanoplatform cFLFLF-C60 capable of suppressing inflammation and targeting
macrophages, potentiating sustained joint retention and therapeutic effects. The goal of this project is to
determine the therapeutic efficacy of the nanoplatform on OA and associated pain. Aim 1 will evaluate the
efficacy of cFLFLF-C60 in human explant models of inflammatory OA. It will establish whether cFLFLF-C60 inhibits
cartilage degradation and inflammation in human joint explants. Aim 2 will determine the sustained effects of
treating OA and associated pain in a mouse model. It will elucidate the efficacy and time window of cFLFLF-C60
to modify cartilage degeneration and pain. This project represents a new and distinct direction for the field
because it addresses the underlying pathogenesis of OA and sustained joint delivery."

The Wnt signaling pathway regulates cardiac morphogenesis and has been associated with congenital heart
disease in both mice and humans. Given that congenital heart diseases are often associated with ventricular
arrhythmias, a common cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population, a better understanding of
the molecular basis may ultimately improve diagnostic and therapeutic options. We found that many genes
encoding ion channel subunits are Wnt transcriptional targets during development, including the major sodium
channel and gap junction isoforms expressed in the heart. Loss of Wnt signaling leads to changes in cardiac
conduction that predispose mice to ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricle, even in the
absence of a structural heart defect. Interestingly, global transcriptional changes are highly distinct between
the left and right ventricles in Wnt loss of function mice, paralleling the distinct electrophysiologic changes.
This proposal will seek to elucidate genomic regulatory elements responsible for differential right versus left
ventricular transcriptional changes in the setting of Wnt perturbation. We hypothesize that non-coding genomic
elements directing ventricular-specific expression patterns may underlie inherited arrhythmias such as Brugada
syndrome and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy which primarily affect the right ventricle. Specifically, the first
aim will elucidate the underlying mechanism whereby Wnt signaling regulates Hey2 expression in the murine
right ventricle, and Notch signaling regulates Hey2 expression in the left ventricle, using transgenic
approaches. Given that genome wide association studies have linked non-coding variants near HEY2 with
Brugada syndrome, perturbation of regulatory elements responsive to Wnt and Notch may have relevance to
human disease. Wnt signaling is also dysregulated in adult acquired heart diseases such as heart failure, a
major cause of morbidity and mortality, where much less is known about its role in regulating conduction and
arrhythmia susceptibility. In Aim 2, we will determine whether there are changes in nuclear β-catenin
accumulation, the effector of canonical Wnt signaling, and whether it correlates with conduction changes in a
clinically relevant murine heart failure model. As a step towards translation, we will measure Wnt activity and
nuclear β-catenin accumulation in human left ventricular tissue from failing and non-failing hearts, and
determine whether nuclei with and without β-catenin express distinct transcripts. Finally, Aim 3 will determine
whether several clinically relevant GSK3 inhibitors inhibit sodium channel transcription in vitro and modulate
conduction velocity in vivo."

A major concern with continuous flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) is the resulting non-physiological
flow with diminished pulsatility which has been shown to be a major risk factor for development of arteriovenous
malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid
changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce ‘artificial pulsatility’. However,
given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events,
it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even
necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed
a vascular pulse perfusion model (VPPM) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) under conditions
of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial
vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are
transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The VPPM was validated as relevant model
via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without CF-VADs. Our published data also shows
that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The
relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience AVMs and
GI bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of pro-
angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The VPPM therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial
pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse
frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure
< 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of GI bleeds, we hypothesize that “Diminished pulsatility
associated with ‘CF-VAD support’ results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble
factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation
strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg”. Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived
endothelial cells within the VPPM to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor
production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/pro-
inflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro
studies within the VPPM and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived
endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic
profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will
enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support."
10824399,"The overall goal of this project is to develop reliable and valid clinical outcome assessments (COAs) and biomarkers for limb girdle muscular dystrophy R1 (LGMDR1) to hasten therapeutic development. LGMDR1 is an autosomal recessive form of LGMD due to a loss of function in muscle structural gene CAPN3. This loss of function leads to progressive weakness of the shoulder and hip girdle muscles and therefore progressive disability, including loss of ambulation or the ability to maintain a job. There are no FDA approved treatments for LGMDR1, which represents a large unmet medical need. LGMDR1 is amenable to gene replacement therapies; and in recent years, a systemic gene therapy has been approved for spinal muscular atrophy and is in development for LGMDR4. At least five companies have gene-targeted therapies or regenerative medicine approaches in development for LGMDR1, creating a situation where therapeutic development has outstripped our ability to prepare for clinical trials. The rationale for this study is that the NorthStar ambulatory assessment for LGMD (NSAD), modified from a widely accepted functional assessment in a related disorder, requires validation as a primary endpoint in LGMDR1. Given the slowly progressive nature of the condition, we also anticipate that a biomarker, such as muscle fat fraction, is required for early phase therapeutic trials to provide an early signal of effect. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To validate the NSAD as a primary endpoint for LGMDR1; and 2) To validate quantitative muscle MRI as a monitoring biomarker in LGMDR1. To achieve our aims, we plan to leverage an existing LGMD Clinical Research Network to conduct a 24-month longitudinal observational study of 100 clinically affected, ambulatory and genetically defined LGMDR1 individuals at 12 sites on our LGMD Research Network. We hypothesize that the NSAD will be amenable to multi-site training, reliable, related to patient-identified areas of disease impact, and useful for power and sample size planning for forthcoming clinical trials. The muscle fat fraction is likely to demonstrate progression in advance of change on the NSAD. Combined, we will model disease progression to define the range of scores on the NSAD that would define the optimal therapeutic trial population. At the completion of this study, we will have validated the NSAD as a primary endpoint for LGMDR1; validated muscle fat fraction as an ideal biomarker for LGMDR1; established the clinical trial characteristics, including inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample size, and clinically important difference for therapeutic trials. Given the significant progress in therapeutic development for LGMDR1, the development of appropriate COAs and biomarkers for this population is an urgent need."
10749049,"The ongoing rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the world has resulted in myriad viral
strains, but human immunity has been acquired from vaccination against a single (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain and/or
previous infection with a handful of strains. The large number of substitutions present in the recently emerged
Omicron Variant of Concern (VOC) spike (S) protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) – a key antigenic site –
are associated with immune evasion and a putative broadening of species tropism. Immune evasion may have
serious consequences, potentially leading to increased incidence of infection, reinfection and/or further
enhancing viral fitness during uncontrolled spread around the globe. Omicron has not directly descended from
any of the previously identified VOCs raising the specter of future, highly-substituted immune-evasive VOCs.
Prior knowledge of the space of potential variants may enable the development of active and passive
immunization strategies for blunting the damage caused by novel VOCs. However, the scientific community
currently lacks the tools to prospectively identify novel highly-substituted VOCs capable of immune evasion. In
Aim 1 we propose a pipeline for discovering a diverse set of heavily substituted and immune-evasive RBD
variants. Relatedly, the medical community lacks binding-based therapeutic passive immunization leads against
unknown future variants that can be deployed in the event of a novel VOC outbreak. For example, many
monoclonal antibody therapies that previously received emergency use authorization from FDA no longer
neutralize the Omicron VOC, leading to fewer clinically relevant pharmaceutical interventions. For Aim 2, we
propose to redesign existing small-protein-based therapeutic entities to bind nearly all possible prospectively
identified novel VOCs. Our proposal is enabled by results from the PI and co-I laboratories, in which we
developed high-throughput structure-based computational and experimental approaches for predicting and
characterizing the binding of diverse SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants with the ACE2 and a set of neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs) to effectively recapitulate variant S function and immune evasion properties. We will apply our
technologies to broadly sample heavily substituted (10-20 substitutions) but functional RBD variants and identify
those that are predicted to abrogate binding to a representative set of neutralizing antibodies raised against two
key (Class 1 and Class 2) epitope regions of the RBD. Experimentally validated classes of escape-competent
RBD variants will serve as targets for the design of small protein-based inhibitors. The overall impact of this
project will be the prospective identification of the space of possible variation in Class 1 and Class 2 epitopes
that can still be recognized by the prevalent immune response. This will aid therapeutic intervention and identify
candidate RBD variant immunogens for inclusion in next-generation vaccines. This project will also provide
potent inhibitors of the diverse highly substituted RBD variants. With further clinical development, these may
serve as off-the-shelf therapeutics for effectively stopping a new VOC in its tracks."
10746002,"There is a persistent gap in our knowledge of the sperm molecules and mechanisms that induce Ca2+
oscillations in mammalian eggs. Ca2+ release triggers egg activation and initiation of embryo development
in all mammals, including human beings. A sperm molecule, the sperm factor, SF, later identified as
Phospholipase zeta, PLCz, was thought to be the only SF responsible for inducing Ca2+ release, and
PLCz inactivating mutations cause infertility in human males. However, Plcz knockout mice are subfertile
and evoke residual Ca2+ oscillations, suggesting the function of a backup mechanism. The component(s)
and the physiological role of the backup system are gaps in our knowledge. These gaps represent serious
impediments, as until we overcome them, we do not understand the Ca2+ regulation of egg activation
events or can objectively diagnose, prevent or treat infertility associated with egg activation failure. The
long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of the Ca2+ oscillations that unfold the developmental
program at fertilization. The objective is to identify the sperm molecules that trigger these Ca2+ oscillations
in the egg. The mouse and its gametes are perfect models because they are amenable to manipulation
and genetic modifications. The central hypothesis underpinning this proposal is that one or more sperm
PLCs besides PLCz contribute to delivering the Ca2+ signal and could serve as the backup mechanism
in case of Plcz disfunction. This hypothesis was conceived based on extensive preliminary data. The
rationale for the proposed research is that once all sperm molecules that induce oscillations are known,
their regulation assessed, and their diagnostic value and application to the reproductive management of
species fully explored. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1)
Identify the molecule(s) in PLC1z-KO sperm that induce Ca2+ oscillations at fertilization; 2) Determine the
contribution of the backup system to the Ca2+ responses and egg activation events of typical fertilization.
Under Aim 1, we will use Trim-21 mRNA, specific antibodies, CRISPR-generated KO mouse lines,
immunofluorescence, Ca2+ monitoring, and embryo culture to determine if PLCd4 is the active factor of
the backup system. Under Aim 2, we will employ similar methods but target different molecules and
mechanisms to ascertain the contribution of the Ca2+ backup system to the Ca2+ signal of typical
fertilization. The research in this application is innovative because it represents a fresh examination of
the role of other sperm PLCs, including one whose deletion causes male infertility, in the oscillations of
fertilization. The contributions of the proposed project are significant because we aim to perfect the
treatment of egg activation failure, improve embryo development, discover indicators of male fertility, and
identify novel targets of contraception. Finally, we anticipate progress in understanding the molecules
and regulatory mechanisms that induce embryo development in mammals."

15 2. Metabolic-Structure-Function Relationships – Explore the relationships between
16 structural and functional RD outcome measures and plasma ornithine levels.
17 3. Identify Rapid Progressors – Explore the relationship of possible risk factors
18 (genotype, phenotype, environmental, standard care dietary regimen) with severity and

22  Develop quantitative measures of progression of the area of preserved retina and
23 establish its reproducibility, sensitivity to change, and relationship with other measures
24  Establish rates of progression of functional RD, structural RD, and patient-reported

10738278,"Abstract
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the efficacy of mRNA vaccines that deliver membrane-anchored
immunogens can be improved by localizing the immunogen to extracellular vesicles (EVs, small membrane-
limited structures shed by eukaryotic cells). Our rationale is that EVs provide a natural scaffold for immunogen
multimerization while also enabling membrane-bound antigens to access antigen presenting cells, both local to
the site of injection, and in the draining lymph node.
To localize immunogens to EVs and promote EV shedding we propose two complimentary approaches. In Aim
1, we will append a viral “late domain” to the carboxy terminus of our immunogen. Viral late domains are small
protein domains, usually associated with a matrix or capsid protein, used by enveloped viruses to facilitate
budding and egress. We have found that these domains can act out of context; fusing a late domain from
feline immunodeficiency virus Gag to a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunogen caused the immunogen to re-
localize to EVs and improved its immunogenicity nearly two-fold. We will expand this work by testing late
domains from other viruses for their ability to promote EV localization and/or production. We will thoroughly
characterize these EVs to determine correlates of vaccine immunogenicity.
In Aim 2, we will modify our immunogens to overcome the activity of the host anti-viral restriction factor BST-2
(a.k.a. tetherin). Tetherin inhibits viral egress by “tethering” budding enveloped viruses to the host cell
membranes and also inhibits the release of EVs by the same mechanism. Therefore, we will explore
strategies for antagonizing tetherin in order to promote release of our immunogen-laden EVs. Enveloped
viruses have evolved different strategies for tetherin evasion that we will attempt to incorporate into our
immunogen designs. Indeed, we have identified a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that we suspect is
responsible for tetherin antagonism. Incorporating this S protein domain into our immunogen dramatically
increases the amount of immunogen recovered from EV fractions of tissue culture supernatants. We will also
explore similar strategies based on tetherin resistance mechanisms from other viruses.
Finally, in Aim 3, promising immunogen design strategies in the context of different viral envelope protein
immunogens (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, HIV) will be compared in mice. These tests will allow us to
establish correlations between the behavior of our vaccine immunogens in tissue culture (quantity and
characteristics of the EVs, cytoxicity, etc.) and performance of the vaccine in vivo and determine if our
modifications universally improve vaccine efficacy, or if particular immunogen designs are better suited for
specific viral antigens."
10828356,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Male infertility is a complicated pathological condition characterized by a heterogeneous spectrum of
phenotypic presentations, rendering its underlying causes obscure. In recent years, genetic disorders emerge
as one of the leading causes of male infertility, accounting for at least 15% of cases. Therefore, understanding
the genetic network that influences various aspects of male fertility such as spermatogenesis (i.e., sperm
production) would greatly benefit the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility. However, the estimate that
thousands of genes may be involved in spermatogenesis makes it difficult to ascribe specific genetic causes to
male infertility. Traditionally the functions of testis-expressing genes can be analyzed by generating knockout
mouse lines given the similarities between mouse and human spermatogenesis. However, this approach
demands significant time and resources, making it challenging to scale. Emerging technologies such as
CRISPR screens coupled with single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can examine gene functions at scale,
but suffer from two major limitations for dissecting testicular gene functions: (i) the lack of a cell culture model
that faithfully recapitulates spermatogenesis makes it difficult to assess whether perturbation of a gene leads to
defects in sperm production in vitro; and (ii) while cell intrinsic effects of a gene perturbation may be read out
using scRNA-seq, the extracellular effects of a gene perturbation cannot be assessed due to tissue
disassociation. This excludes using CRISPR screens to identify genes controlling phenotypes that require
spatial resolution to assess such as genes encoding for secreted factors. Therefore, a CRISPR screen
approach that retains the spatial context of spermatogenesis is needed to interrogate testicular gene functions
at a high throughput. There are currently two main challenges to develop a spatially resolved CRISPR screen
approach: (i) to capture mRNA transcripts in situ at scale and at single-cell resolution; and (ii) to read out the
identity of each gene perturbation and the mRNA transcripts within a cell simultaneously. To address these two
main challenges, we will greatly improve and expand an in situ RNA sequencing protocol we have recently
established to spatially profile hundreds of mRNA species directly in testicular samples. We will also perform a
proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate co-capture of CRISPR guide RNA and mRNA in intact testicular
tissues using the same in situ sequencing approach. Together, these efforts will enable a highly innovative
functional genomics approach to dissect gene functions in the native tissue context at an unprecedented
spatial resolution and throughput."

resulting in maturational arrest of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and myelination failure. Moreover,
there is increased CSF production and concurrent obstruction in CSF flow, which leads to hydrocephalus. IVH-
induced injury may disrupt the integrity and function of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood-CSF barrier
(BCB), allowing myeloid cells to infiltrate the brain, and fluids to exude from it, thus worsening the
consequences of IVH. Sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) is a lipid mediator and a key regulator of BBB and BCB
function. S1P binds and stimulates G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR1 through S1PR5). S1PR1 contributes
to vessel maturation, regulates adherens and tight junction assembly and function, and limits trafficking of
immune cells across the BBB. In contrast, S1PR2 promotes immune responses, increases BBB permeability,
and facilitates leukocyte entry into the brain. Thus, constitutively-expressed S1PR1 antagonizes S1PR2, which
is often induced under pathological conditions in the BBB. Both S1PR1 activation and S1PR2 inhibition offer
neuroprotection in brain injury models. However, the role of S1PR1 and S1PR2 in BBB and BCB damage,
hydrocephalus, and white matter injury is unclear in neonates with IVH. Our central hypotheses are: i) IVH
will induce inflammation, disrupt the BBB and BCB, and alter S1PR1 and S1PR2 expressions in the BBB and
BCB in both humans and rabbits and ii) modulation of S1PR1 and S1PR2 signaling by receptor subtype-
specific agents will restore BBB and BCB integrity, minimize cerebral inflammation, and reverse white matter
injury and hydrocephalus in preterm rabbits with IVH. We will test these hypotheses in a rabbit model of
glycerol-induced IVH and autopsy samples from human premature infants. In Aim 1, we will determine the
effect of IVH on a) BBB and BCB permeability and immune cell infiltration across the BBB and BCB, b)
endothelial tight and adherens junction, endothelial transcytosis, and key transporters, and c) transcriptional
changes in the capillary endothelium of the periventricular brain region and choroid plexus. The observations
made in rabbit will be validated in autopsy samples from preterm infants with and without IVH. In Aim 2 and 3,
we will evaluate the effect of S1PR1 and S1PR2 modulation on a) BBB and BCB permeability, endothelial tight
and adherens junction assembly, endothelial transcytosis and transcriptome, b) immune cell infiltration,
ventriculomegaly, and c) myelination and neurobehavior. We will also determine whether S1PR1 and S1PR2
signaling affect adherens and tight junction as well as myelination via sonic hedgehog and Rho-ROCK
pathways, respectively. These studies will enhance our understanding of S1P biology in the maturing brain and
hasten development of new therapies to minimize white matter injury and hydrocephalus in survivors of IVH."

This application responds to PAR-16-454:
International Bioethics Research Training Program (D43) with a
focus on bioethics research training in Tanzania.
The need for doctoral-trained bioethics scholars and
bioethics scholarship in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) is urgent. With the recent emergence of
the coronavirus public health pandemic and concerns about the allocation of finite resources, LMICs face
daunting challenges when making ethical decisions that affect their citizens. They also face other day-to-
day ethical issues in clinical care and clinical research, including informed consent from vulnerable patients,
HIV incidence and prevalence, cultural views about decision-making roles, truth-telling to patients and
families, and many others. All these areas require educating and developing bioethicists in Tanzania
(ENGAGE). We capitalize on nine years of successful interdisciplinary collaboration between Muhimbili
University of Health and Allied Services (MUHAS), Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania to
prepare a cadre of doctoral prepared bioethics scholars in Tanzania. The collaboration has facilitated the
creation, staffing, and demonstrated sustainability and successes of the Department of Bioethics and
Health Professionalism in the School of Public Health and Social Sciences. The Department offers the
Masters of Bioethics and teaches bioethics across the broad spectrum of degree programs offered at
MUHAS. The purpose of this application is to build on this accomplishment and address the need to
develop bioethics scholars who can integrate theory, research, and public-health policy and become
intellectual and academic leaders in the field of bioethics relevant to the country. To achieve this aim, we
propose to: (1) recruit and train six individuals at the doctoral level; (2) prepare the next generation of
bioethics scholars who will be at the forefront of scientific inquiry and advancement of the public's health in
Tanzania, and (3) develop a sustainable research capacity for bioethics in the region. There is no institution
in Tanzania that offers formal bioethics training at the doctoral level. Thus, the country and the region will
benefit from doctoral prepared bioethicists who have the skills to address the country's most pressing
bioethics and public health-related problems."

Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) is a leading cause of nosocomial infection in the United States and is a predominant
pathogen in communities. Treatment of Sa infections is complicated by the prevalence of antibiotic resistant and
highly virulent clones, making new therapeutic alternatives a necessity. Sa survives during infection by
subverting immune defenses and adapting to host-imposed nutrient restriction. Yet, we lack a unifying
understanding of these adaptations to the host environment, which complicates the development of new
therapeutics and vaccines. We recently discovered that a cofactor required for metabolic enzyme complex
function and potent antioxidant, lipoic acid (LA), is a critical mediator of Sa growth and survival during infection.
Furthermore, we found that Sa releases the lipoylated E2 subunit of the metabolic enzyme complex pyruvate
dehydrogenase to blunt protective innate immune responses via its LA moiety. Thus, our work has uncovered a
mechanism of Sa survival during infection that links bacterial metabolism and nutrient acquisition to defense
against innate immunity. Despite establishing these roles for LA biosynthesis and salvage in Sa pathobiology,
there exist major gaps in our understanding of the mechanics of how LA blunts immunity and promotes optimal
metabolism during infection. Notably: (i) the precise mechanism by which bacterial LA-protein blunts immune
activation has not been elucidated; (ii) regulation of LA distribution on essential metabolic enzymes is not
understood; (iii) the role of LA in mediating defense against oxidative stress has not been investigated; and (iv)
the relevance of LA acquisition to survival in different infection sites is not understood. This renewal application
will address these gaps in knowledge by ascertaining precisely how LA subverts immunity and the mechanics of
LA synthesis/salvage that promote bacterial survival in vivo with the potential to lay the groundwork for new
targeted therapeutics. Aim 1 will determine how bacterial-derived LA blunts immune responses. Aim 2 will
determine how Sa regulates LA salvage and distribution. Aim 3 will investigate how accessibility to host nutrients
in different tissues determines the requirement for LA during infection."

Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years.
The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure,
and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that
deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV
dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor
outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances
in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may
bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel
intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy.
Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in
evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in
imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general
population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology,
subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural
and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies,
community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to
gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed
and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are
threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD
and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to
understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term
prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early
and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal
is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of
cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care."

Metabolism is a key driver of T cell functions, and the switch from oxidative-phosphorylation to aerobic
glycolysis is a hallmark of T cell activation. Unfortunately, tumor reactive T cells often display a compromised
metabolic status due to metabolic competition with cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME).
Therefore, strategies to enhance metabolic fitness of T cells within the metabolically challenging tumor bed
may rescue resistance to existing cancer immunotherapies. In this context, we have focused on the regulation
of T cell metabolism by Sirt2, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
Sirt2 functions as a metabolic checkpoint that harnesses T cell effector functions and impairs anti-tumor
immunity. Specifically, upregulation of Sirt2 expression in human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs)
negatively correlates with response to Nivolumab and TIL therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
Mechanistically, Sirt2 suppresses glycolysis and oxidative-phosphorylation by deacetylating key metabolic
enzymes. Accordingly, Sirt2-deficient T cells manifest increased glycolysis and oxidative-phosphorylation,
display enhanced proliferation and effector functions, and have superior anti-tumor activity. Importantly,
pharmacologic inhibition of Sirt2 endows human TILs with these superior metabolic fitness and enhanced
effector functions. These findings indicate targeting Sirt2 may allow reprogramming of T cell metabolism to
augment a broad spectrum of cancer immunotherapies. Guided by this scientific premise we propose the
overall hypothesis that Sirt2 activity governs the metabolic fitness of T cells at tumor beds, and
therefore controls the magnitude of immune pressure against malignant progression. We will test this
hypothesis in the following specific aims: Aim 1 will investigate the precise molecular mechanisms via which
Sirt2 regulate glycolysis, TCA cycle, glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and the post-translational
mechanisms that govern Sirt2 expression and function in tumor-reactive T cells. Aim 2 will explore the
metabolic functions of Sirt2 in physiologic contexts of T cells during activation, differentiation, maturation and
as they are subjected to metabolic constraints within the tumor beds. Aim 3 will determine the metabolic and
immunologic consequences of Sirt2 inhibition in human TILs for clinical translation, and correlate Sirt2
expression in TILs with response to immunotherapy. These aims will be achieved by employing a variety of
experimental strategies involving in vitro and in vivo metabolic and immunologic analyses of various genetically
engineered animals, complemented by molecular biology and genetic studies using primary human T cells and
patient-derived TILs from lung cancer and melanoma. Collectively, our proposed studies will provide a
comprehensive view of the role of Sirt2-regulated metabolic processes in tumor-reactive T cells. The results
from our proposed studies will validate Sirt2 as an actionable metabolic and immunologic target, and Sirt2
inhibition will be a tractable means to improve cancer immunotherapy."

A stem-mesenchymal phenotype of the tumor epithelium, and its associated immunosuppressive and
desmoplastic stroma, are fundamental characteristics of the most aggressive and poor survival type of
colorectal cancer CRC. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving this process are still far from
clear. This proposal stems from a series of recently published and unpublished observations in my laboratory
that identify the two atypical PKCs (aPKC; PKC and PKC/) as novel tumor suppressors acting in concert to
prevent this aggressive form of CRC. Thus, the simultaneous loss of both aPKCs in the intestinal epithelium (in
a new DKOIEC mouse line) results in highly mesenchymal adenocarcinomas with a reactive and strongly
immunosuppressed stroma. Both aPKCs are significantly downregulated in mesenchymal/stromal/
immunosuppressive CRC human patients who have the most unfavorable prognosis. Our unpublished
preliminary data demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) deficient in PKC/ (or both aPKCs)
upregulate the stem cell receptor CD44, concomitant with the downregulation of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells,
suggesting the appearance of a new type of tumor initiating cells (TICs). Inhibition of CD44+ in tumor organoids
demonstrate its requirement for growth and supports its physiopathological relevance. Consistently, inhibition
of one of the key CD44 stromal ligands (hyaluronan) in vivo abrogates the mesenchymal phenotype of DKOIEC
tumors inhibiting the immunosuppressive response and restoring immunosurveillance. We hypothesize that the
upregulation of a new type of CD44+/Lgr5- TICs by the loss of PKC/ is central in the development of the
aggressive type of CRC. The upregulation of the MAP kinase cascades, together with the identification, in a
series of unbiassed approaches, of the transcription factor KLF4 as a potential critical intermediary between
PKC/ and CD44 expression, led us to hypothesize that the activation of ERK/JNK by PKC/ deficiency
triggers AP1 and, concurrently, induces the degradation of KLF4; both actions cooperate to drive CD44
expression and the mesenchymal phenotype of very aggressive CRC. Therefore, in this proposal, we will
determine the role of CD44 in the aggressive/mesenchymal type of CRC (Aim 1), as well as the molecular
mechanisms whereby PKC/ regulates CD44 expression and function in this process (Aim 2). The successful
completion of the proposed studies will create a new paradigm of significance and impact that will contribute to
a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving the poor prognosis mesenchymal type of
CRC, which will be key for the design of new therapeutic targets for this type of aggressive neoplasia."
10771246,"CRC is the third leading cause of tumor-related deaths attributed to vital organ metastasis. CRC
patient survival is highly dependent on the cancer staging at the time of diagnosis and, despite
the recent progresses made in the clinical management of this disease, it remains a meagre 13%
for the patients diagnosed with cancer metastasis. Remarkably, resistance to the anti-cancer
therapy contributes heavily to the metastasis as ~90% of patients with metastatic cancer are also
resistant to the therapies. Thus, developing novel and targeted therapies for inhibiting CRC
progression and metastasis is essential and urgent.
In this regard, extensive preclinical and clinical studies from our laboratory, and of other
laboratories, have now validated a causal role for the upregulated claudin-1 expression in
promoting CRC metastasis. In a comprehensive analysis examining a large CRC-patient cohort,
cell lines and mouse models, we have reported a highly significant association of the deregulated
claudin-1 expression with CRC metastasis. Mechanistic investigations into these findings
revealed physical binding of claudin-1 with proto-oncogene Src, in promoting CRC metastasis. So
far, no known small molecule inhibitor for claudin-1 exists. Using a rigorous analytical design that
included in vitro and in vivo testing, we identified a claudin-1 specific inhibitor. Further analogs were
synthesized, we now have narrowed down our search to a novel and specific small molecule
inhibitor, PDS-0330, for efficient inhibition of the CLDN1 dependent CRC progression. These data
have led to the central hypothesis of this proposal that PDS-0330 can inhibit CLDN1/Src
association to inhibit CRC progression and metastasis. In this grant proposal, we will optimize the
potency, pharmacokinetic properties of PDS-0330 analogs to develop novel tool compounds. We
will also determine binding specificity and characterize the binding epitope of PDS-0330 to inhibit
colon cancer progression. Finally, we will determine the efficacy of PDS0330 in inhibiting Claudin-
1-dependent phenotypes in mouse and organoid model of aggressive CRC."

Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care with the overarching goal of improving quality of life for
patients with serious illness through symptom management, provision of psychosocial support, elicitation of
preferences and aiding decision-making. Prior studies have demonstrated that specialist palliative care is
associated with decreases in treatment intensity and improvements in quality of life, but have also suggested
that existing heterogeneity among palliative care teams may be associated with variability in their
effectiveness. Early integration of specialist palliative care for patients with advanced cancer has been
recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. However, as hospitals race to implement
palliative care programs to meet these guidelines, there is little evidence to guide them as to which ingredients
are necessary for effective care delivery. The proposed research will target this important knowledge gap by 1)
quantifying the association between use of specialist palliative care and end-of-life quality metrics in cancer
care, 2) examining whether differences in specialist palliative care implementation (as measured by key
variables reflecting team attributes and operational characteristics) are associated with improvements in quality
metrics and 3) using qualitative research methods to understand how programs operationalize care delivery
within different hospital settings. This project will create and utilize a novel data source that combines
nationwide patient and hospital-level data, detailed data on palliative care programs and valid information on
receipt of specialist palliative care. Quantitative analyses of this unique dataset will be followed by in-depth site
visits to six select palliative care programs; together, these data will be used to develop an actionable roadmap
that may be used to refine existing palliative care programs and inform implementation of future programs to
ensure effective delivery of palliative care for patients with cancer. This project represents an important
advance in understanding the role of palliative care specialists in cancer care, as prior work has focused on
whether specialist palliative care is associated with improved outcomes, while this work will focus identifying
the conditions under which specialist palliative care may achieve improved outcomes."

Fibrotic liver disease is a growing public health concern significantly impacting the global population. Fibrotic
liver disease is often the result of sustained insults; chronic viral hepatitis B and C as well as NAFLD are the
most prevalent causes. While antiviral regimens for hepatitis B and C have decreased the viral cirrhosis burden,
other causes like NAFLD are increasingly prevalent, now affecting 14-27% of individuals in developed countries.
 Despite this high disease burden, there are currently no approved therapies. Rather, the lack of consensus
on optimal drug targets or strategies reflects a gap in our mechanistic understanding of disease drivers. Similarly,
the utility and clinical relevance of animal models is equally controversial. A multitude of models are currently
used, but each recapitulates only isolated aspects of human pathophysiology. There is an unmet need for
human-relevant systems that recapitulate key elements of fibrotic liver disease to enable mechanistic dissection.
 The measurable improvement in liver fibrosis in some but not all patients following successful antiviral
treatment reinforces the need for better understanding of fibrogenesis at a molecular level to aid development of
new treatments to prevent fibrosis or encourage regression. For NAFLD, despite identification of increasing
numbers of susceptibility-associated genetic variants and lifestyle-dependent risk factors, the mechanisms by
which they individually or synergistically contribute to disease progression remain largely unclear.
 The primary research goal of this proposal is to exploit a unique renewable and genetically manipulatable
human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multicellular culture system to address the aforementioned gaps. In
this multicellular system, we coculture hPSC-derived hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and
macrophages in a manner that recapitulates the complexity of liver physiology in both health and disease.
Modeling hepatitis virus infection and NAFLD in the multicellular cultures, we found that both HCV infection and
a lipotoxic milieu induced inflammatory signals and stellate cell activation. A lipotoxic milieu also triggered other
features of NAFLD clinical phenotypes. Eliminating HCV reversed fibrosis-like phenotypes and treating with
obeticholic acid showed improvement in NAFLD-like features, as observed in the clinic.
 Across three aims, using cell and molecular approaches, we capitalize on the unique features of this novel
platform to address questions that cannot be adequately answered with any existing ex vivo human-relevant
system, including the roles of cytokines in HSC activation (Aim 1), the mechanisms of reversion after activation
(Aim 2) and the role of genetics and lifestyle-associated risk factors in NAFLD (Aim 3). Understanding the
molecular mechanisms of stellate cell activation and fibrosis development are critical for developing diagnostics
and designing new treatments to block fibrosis or promote regression. In addition, elucidating the mechanisms
of how genetic variants and risk factors contribute to liver disease progression may offer the opportunity to craft
targeted antifibrotic interventions optimized for particular patient subgroups."

10771252,"Degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) due to myxomatous valve disease affects millions. The only treatment is either valve repair or replacement. This competing renewal will advance understanding of the role of the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5HT) in MR. Heart valve disease has been associated with both 5HT-secreting carcinoid tumors and medications, such as the diet drug, Dexfenfluoramine. Based on our progress in the 1ST program period, we will investigate the hypothesis that 5HT-mechanisms involving the serotonin transporter (SERT), and 5HT receptor (HTR) signaling, both in platelets and mitral valve interstitial cells (MVIC) of bone marrow origin, contribute to the pathophysiology MR, and represent promising therapeutic targets. Specific Aim 1: To dissect 5HT-mediated mechanisms that influence pathologic remodeling of MV leaflets in human subjects and mice Subaim 1A: To characterize 5HT-mediated MV remodeling in MR compared to normal mitral valve (MV) leaflets and human-derived MVICs. SERT-antagonists, and HTR inhibitor studies will dissect unique 5HT related transcriptome and cellular phenotypes associated with MR progression in vitro and ex vivo under TGFβ, BMP4, and 5HT stimulation. Endpoints will be transcriptomic, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in human MVIC and tissue from MR compared to normal leaflets exposed to 5HT-related mechanistic interrogation. Subaim 1B: To investigate the role of SERT in the pathogenesis of MR: The SERT deleted mouse (SERT-/-) spontaneously develops a valvulopathy affecting the mitral and aortic valves. Mechanistic studies will compare SERT-/- to SERT+/+ . Endpoints will include valve thickness, myocardial fibrosis, and changes in the MV transcriptome, to understand disease progression in this SERT-related valvulopathy. Specific Aim 2: To investigate the role of 5HT in the pathogenesis of MR involving platelet mechanisms and bone marrow derived blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) that express both CD34 and HTR2B. Subaim 2A: It is noteworthy that MR results in a chronic state of platelet activation, since platelets are the primary carriers of 5HT in blood, releasing 5HT upon activation. We will study the role of platelets in 5HT related MR pathophysiology in human subjects, canines with MR, and mice. Endpoints will include 5HT levels, platelet activation markers, and differences in TGF-b1 levels resulting from platelet alpha granule release. Subaim 2B: To investigate the role of bone marrow derived cells in the pathophysiology of 5HT mechanisms that affect MR. BOEC will be cultivated from the study groups in Subaim 2A. The experimental designs will use flow cytometry for cell characterization, qRT-PCR studies to assess gene expression patterns, and proteomic approaches to assess HTR activity, and measurements of ECM production in vitro. It is expected that the mechanistic results of these studies will lead to therapeutic directions for MR that target platelet derived 5HT and leverage a personalized approach using BOEC to model the pathophysiology."

The improvement in living standards and the advancement in modern medicine have greatly extended human
life expectancy. However, aging-related functional decline and diseases, in particular cognitive impairment and
neurodegeneration, also become more prevalent. Studies of heterochronic blood exchange reveal that the
aged systemic milieu inhibits neurogenesis and impairs cognitive functions in young animals, suggesting the
existence of age-elevated systemic factors detrimental to brain health. In particular, inflammation may become
excessive and chronic with aging (“inflammaging”) and impair normal brain functions. Thus proteins involved in
inflammatory responses, such as cytokines, are candidates of such systemic factors implicated in brain aging.
Building upon published literature and our recent finding, we hypothesize that aging-associated alterations in
systemic inflammatory factors activate microglia (resident immune cells in the central nervous system) and
lead to microglia-mediated synapse loss; restoring the expression pattern of such factors to the healthy young
state rescues synaptic defects and improves cognitive functions. In Aim 1, we will use bio-orthogonal non-
canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to determine how treatment with a cocktail of Alk5 inhibitor (Alk5i)
and oxytocin (OT, a neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory peptide) or heterochronic blood exchange affects the
expression profile and distribution of inflammaging-related systemic factors in the brain and peripheral tissues.
Aim 2 examines how Alk5i+OT treatment and heterochronic blood exchange affect neuro-immune interaction
in the brain, taking advantage of in vivo two-photon imaging to study microglia-synaptic interactions and their
effects on synaptic integrity and dynamics in the cortex. Using Array Tomography, a high-throughput, super-
resolution proteomic imaging technique, Aim 3 conducts molecular dissection and reconstruction of large
populations of individual synapses and determines the effect of Alk5i+OT treatment and heterochronic blood
exchange on synaptic molecular signatures and inflammatory cytokine distribution in the brain. Together, these
studies will provide a comprehensive characterization of age-specific effects of blood on the brain proteome
and synaptic circuits, and outline candidate mechanism(s) responsible for brain aging."
10783056,"Brain metastases account for decreased survival, increased morbidity, impaired cognition and poor quality of life
for patients with lung cancer. Effective therapies for the treatment of brain metastases are lacking due in part to
limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that regulate colonization of the brain parenchyma. Lung cancer
is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the U.S., with an overall five-year survival rate of ~16%. It is estimated
that ~ 234,030 new cases and ~ 154,050 deaths of lung cancer per year. Notably, ~40% of lung cancer patients
have metastases at the time of diagnosis, and exhibit the highest prevalence of brain metastasis (40-60 %)
among all cancer types. Current therapies to treat lung cancer brain metastases have proven ineffective due to
variable, transient and incomplete responses. We recently reported that allosteric inhibitors of the ABL kinases
cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and markedly impair the growth of brain metastases. Enhanced expression
of ABL and downstream target genes is linked to shortened survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients. We have
identified specific ABL-regulated transcription factors that mediate the brain metastatic potential of lung cancer
cells by regulating reciprocal crosstalk between brain metastases and neural cells. An unexpected role of this
ABL-regulated transcription network is that it promotes expression of neuronal signatures in brain metastatic
lung cancer cells. Acquisition of “neuronal mimicry” by lung tumors is a potential mechanistic adaptation to
achieve effective colonization and outgrowth in the brain by co-opting the function of neuronal cells, astrocytes
and microglia. In this regard, we found that inhibition of ABL kinases in lung cancer cells impairs deleterious
inflammatory responses of brain microglia cells. The overall hypothesis is that ABL-regulated transcription
networks promote brain metastasis, and that inhibition of ABL signaling enhances tumor cell vulnerabilities by
disrupting crosstalk between brain metastatic cells and resident neural cells in the brain tumor microenvironment.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1) Define the ABL-regulated transcription networks
that promote lung cancer brain metastasis and the mechanisms whereby inactivation of ABL kinases impairs
brain metastasis. 2) Evaluate whether inactivation of ABL kinases impairs metastatic colonization of the brain
parenchyma by disrupting tumor-neural cell crosstalk, while concomitantly blunting tumor-induced neurotoxicity.
3) Define the transcriptional landscape of lung cancer brain metastases and assess whether ABL-regulated
transcriptomic signatures identify lung cancer types that metastasize to the brain. To this end we will employ
state-of-the-art transcriptomic technologies to evaluate transcriptional changes, not only in brain metastasis, but
also among neural cell types in the surrounding brain parenchyma. Results from these experiments will reveal
the transcriptional landscapes of lung cancer brain metastases, critical to identify biomarkers and actionable
targets. Data generated will identity novel signaling networks that promote brain metastases and uncover novel
targets to treat this disease and decrease tumor-induced neurotoxicity."
10989128,"Mechanisms of ER Protein Quality Control in Podocytes
SUMMARY
My laboratory has a long-standing interest in protein folding and degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) by defining the physiological and pathological importance of mammalian ER quality-control machineries in
vivo. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is the principal protein quality-control mechanism responsible for
targeting misfolded proteins in the ER for cytosolic proteasomal degradation. The SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex
represents the most conserved branch of ERAD. We recently showed that mice with Sel1L deficiency in
podocytes develop proteinuria at ~5 weeks of age and die prematurely with a median life span of ~14 weeks for
both males and females (Yoshida et al. 2021 J CIin Invest). Electron microscopic analyses revealed foot process
effacement and impaired slit diaphragm in the absence of Sel1L. Mechanistically, we showed that SEL1L-HRD1
ERAD in podocytes plays a critical role in the maturation of nascent nephrin in the ER, without affecting podocyte
cell number and survival. In our recent work, our preliminary data suggested a possible crosstalk, or likely
synergism, between ERAD and another key degradative pathway autophagy in podocytes. We propose to test
the overarching hypothesis that the SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD protein complex plays a critical role in podocytes by
coordinating the activation of autophagy, which ensures cellular homeostasis and filtration function. This model
challenges/expands the current paradigm in ER biology by placing SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD at the center of cellular
function in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. Using various mouse models, we will accomplish the
following Aims: (1) Demonstrate the pathophysiological importance of the crosstalk between SEL1L-HRD1
ERAD and autophagy in podocytes; (2) Determine how SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD controls autophagy activity in
podocytes; and (3) Delineate the pathological importance and mechanism of ERAD and autophagy in the
pathogenesis of nephrin disease mutants involved in nephrotic syndrome. This study will provide unprecedented
insights into the crosstalk among key ER quality control machineries in podocytes, and shed new light on the
therapeutic potential of targeting ER homeostasis in podocytes.
RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH: Defects in podocytes and in the formation slit diaphragm, a specialized
structure involving many transmembrane proteins, underlie nephrotic syndrome, affecting children and adults of
all ages. While the ER quality control systems are presumably integrated to maintain ER homeostasis, the
crosstalk between quality-control systems has not yet been investigated in vivo. This study will establish the
pathophysiological significance of ERAD and the crosstalk between ERAD and autophagy in podocytes in health
and diseases."

Sex-specific steroid hormones control cell growth and proliferation in reproductive organs including the ovaries,
breast, uterus, prostate and testes. But how they impact non-reproductive organs is less well known. Considering
the sex-biased incidence of many common diseases (e.g. colorectal and gastric cancer), the physiological effects
of steroid signaling on the non-sex organs probably have profound health-relevance. We discovered that the
Drosophila steroid hormone, 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20HE), promotes intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and
adaptive organ growth, causing the female fly’s intestine to nearly double in size after mating (4). 20HE is
produced by the activated ovaries after mating, and stimulates ISC proliferation via its receptor EcR/Usp and
downstream targets Broad and Eip75B. 20HE also triggers EGFR/ERK signaling via unknown mechanisms, and
this is essential for ISC activation. Our data suggest that 20HE-dependent gut remodeling in females enhances
nutrient uptake, fecundity and reproductive fitness. However, the 20HE-dependent hyperactivity of ISCs also
increases the female predisposition to gut dysplasia and tumorigenesis, a fitness trade off that can shorten
lifespan. Our findings raise many questions about how 20HE signaling re-configures the female gut, how this
alters gut and whole-body physiology, and whether sex steroids play similar roles in mammals. Here we address
these questions in four Specific Aims. First, we use cell type-targeted genetics to determine the functions of EcR
signaling in ISCs and committed progenitors called enteroblasts (EB), focusing on how 20HE gene targets
activate ISC growth, metabolism and division, and on how 20HE amplifies the stem cell pool. In Aim 2, we use
single cell RNA sequencing to map the effects of 20HE on each of the five main gut cell types in vivo. We also
perform in vivo EcR binding site analysis by CUT&Tag, to map direct 20HE:EcR gene targets in midgut progenitor
cells. The combined data from these assays will give a comprehensive atlas of the gene expression network
effects of 20HE signaling in the gut. In Aim 3 we test the hypothesis that 20HE optimizes nutrient delivery to the
fly’s other organs (e.g. ovaries, fat body) by altering the growth, metabolism and/or digestive capabilities of gut
enterocytes. In Aim 4, we conduct experiments in mouse intestinal organoids and mice, testing whether the
human sex steroids estradiol, progesterone, and/or testosterone promote intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)
proliferation and gut growth in mammals. These studies will provide insights into the action of sex steroids as
mitogens, regulators of stem cell self-renewal, and mediators of metabolism and nutrient uptake. This work will
provide paradigms and lead data for understanding the basis of the sex-biased incidence of many human
diseases, notably those involving altered stem cell behavior such as cancer, chronic inflammation, degenerative,
and metabolic diseases."
10808069,"SUMMARY
During the fetal to adult transition, the heart undergoes dramatic developmental maturation. Following birth,
many cardiac myocyte processes undergo transformation to adult programs including mitochondrial capacity,
fuel utilization pathways, and the contractile machinery. Whereas, considerable progress has been made in
defining the gene regulatory and signaling events involved in early cardiac development and morphogenesis,
the mechanisms involved in postnatal cardiac developmental maturation are poorly understood. Delineation of
the circuitry driving cardiac myocyte maturation is relevant to heart disease given that during the development
of heart failure, many metabolic and contractile processes shift to an immature or “fetal” state. In addition, a
better understanding of the mechanisms driving cardiac myocyte maturation will provide new strategies for
enabling full maturation of human induced-pluripotent stem cells into adult cardiac myocytes in experimental
systems including proof-of-concept therapeutic studies. Our recent work has shown that the nuclear receptors
ERR and, central effectors of the PGC-1 transcriptional regulatory circuit, are key drivers of mitochondrial
biogenesis and maturation during postnatal cardiac development, and in the adult heart. Very recently, we found
that the ERRs are not only regulators of mitochondrial maturation, but are also necessary for postnatal cardiac
development. We seek to define the players and mechanisms involved in the broad program of postnatal cardiac
maturation by starting with the PGC-1/ERR complex. This project is defined to test the novel hypothesis that the
nuclear receptors ERR and, central components of the PGC-1-induced transcriptional regulatory
circuit, function as key components of a broader cardiac maturation network. The proposed experimental
plan, buttressed by preliminary data and reagents developed over the past two years of the current funding
period, will employ a combination of state-of-the-art proteomics, functional genomics, in vivo studies in mice, and
human heart tissue profiling. Using the ERR as an anchor nexus we will: 1) define the protein interaction network
of transcriptional and epigenomic regulators that cooperate with the ERRs (ERR interactome) to orchestrate
metabolic and non-metabolic cardiac myocyte gene target expression; 2) identify upstream factors and signals
that trigger activation of the PGC-1/ERR circuitry during cardiac maturation; and 3) determine how this network
shifts toward the fetal state during development of heart failure, and assess the potential of its re-activation to
ameliorate pathological cardiac remodeling in pre-clinical heart failure models. The planned studies will lead to
important new insights into the mechanisms whereby the fetal heart transforms into the adult heart and will
provide in-depth, pre-clinical, assessment of the potential of re-activating cardiac myocyte maturation as a novel
therapeutic for heart failure."
10791871,"Severe asthma patients have a high morbidity and utilize >50% of asthma-related health care
each year. IL-33 signaling through its receptor, ST2 (IL1RL1), drives allergic airway
inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and mucus production by increasing IL-4, IL-5, and
IL-13 production from Th2, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and other cells types. While
anti-IL-33 is a promising asthma therapeutic, additional understanding of pathways the regulate
this pathway could lead to novel therapeutic options in this patient population. In the previous
funding period, we determined how ovarian hormones increased IL-17A and type 2-mediated
airway inflammation in severe asthma, which is most common in women. Through the course of
these studies we also found that that androgen receptor (AR) signaling attenuated Th17 cell
differentiation, ILC2 proliferation, and allergic airway inflammation. Gonadectomized male mice
(which lack androgens) also had increased Alt Ext-induced IL-33 compared to hormonally intact
male mice. Yet, the mechanisms by which AR signaling attenuates allergen-induced airway
inflammation were unclear. Androgens signaling through the AR are associated with increased
lung function and decreased asthma symptom scores in women and men with asthma. New
preliminary data for this application suggest that AR signaling decreases allergic airway
inflammation by decreasing the release of active IL-33, sustaining T regulatory cells (Tregs)
stability and suppressive function, and decreasing ST2 expression on Th2 and ILC2 cells to limit
IL-33-mediated allergic airway inflammation. We hypothesize that AR signaling post-
transcriptionally modifies IL-33 to limit release, restrains downstream IL-33 signaling by
inhibiting ST2 expression and signaling, and stabilizes Treg suppressive function. To test this
hypothesis, we will use primary, differentiated bronchial epithelial cell and immune cells from the
excised lungs and lymph nodes of women and men with asthma as well as mouse models of
asthma to: Aim 1) Determine the mechanisms by which AR signaling limits IL-33 release from
human bronchial epithelial cells, Aim 2) Delineate how AR signaling potentiates Treg stability
and suppressive function during allergic airway inflammation, and Aim 3) Determine if AR
signaling decreases ST2 expression and downstream signaling on Th2 cells to reduce allergic
airway inflammation. Delineating how AR signaling attenuates IL-33 release while maintaining
lung Treg function will be critical for personalizing therapies for women and men with severe
asthma and potentially other IL-33-mediated diseases."
10786076,"Development of small molecule inhibitors of metabolic enzymes as broad spectrum anthelmintic drugs
Abstract
Parasitic intestinal nematodes including hookworms, roundworm and whipworms, infect over two billion people
worldwide, causing significant morbidity, perpetuation of poverty, and loss of life. Characterization of nematode
genomes provides fundamental molecular information essential for accelerating basic and translational research,
which is a public health priority due to the limited number of currently available effective drugs and increasing
drug resistance. In this proposal, we will pursue post-genomic drug discovery studies to develop small molecule
drugs as novel therapeutics to treat infections caused by these devastating parasites.
 We have established an extensive omics/bioinformatics database for human nematode parasites
spanning the major taxonomic clades of Nematoda. Using systems biology and evolutionary principles, we
reconstructed metabolic networks for 56 diverse nematode parasites and identified chokepoint enzymes, i.e.
metabolic enzymes that uniquely consume a specific substrate or generate a unique product. This led to our
central hypothesis that compounds that inhibit conserved chokepoint enzymes have a strong potential for broad
control of diverse nematodes. To test this, we identified conserved targets and initial inhibitors with potential for
broad-spectrum activity, for which phenotypic screening of parasites at the extremes of the phylogeny have
validated our predictions. Furthermore, we established a unique database of nematode-specific molecular
features among the chokepoint enzyme targets and experimentally established that active-site differences in the
nematode enzymes relative to their human orthologs can rationally guide the design of selective inhibitors.
 The compounds with the best activity in our phenotypic screens are inhibitors predicted to target three
known enzyme classes (CPT, mTOR/PI3K, and PDE). To confirm the putative nematode target(s), we will
express nematode proteins and implement biochemical enzyme inhibition assays, employ affinity-based labeling
techniques, and test for activity against target knockdown worms (Aim 1). By leveraging parasite-specific active-
site features of the confirmed protein targets, we will use a X-ray structure-based drug design (SBDD) to optimize
lead inhibitors of the three identified target classes (Aim 2). Optimized lead compounds most effective against
the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum and the whipworm Trichuris muris in vitro will be tested in vivo
for their pan-intestinal efficacy in hamster and mouse animal models of nematode infection (Aim 3).
 Our preliminary results, combined with this proposed research, are highly significant since they provide
a better understanding of metabolic functions essential for nematode survival, which can be targeted for drug
discovery. The rational targeting of metabolic chokepoint enzymes as anthelminthic agents is innovative, as is
the concept of utilizing specific pan-phylum conserved targets to develop anthelmintic drug or drugs with broad
spectrum efficacy against nematodes. Collectively, this work has high potential to provide one or more new small
molecule therapeutics with broad spectrum activity against parasitic nematode infections."
10804723,"Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) in Maryland
 Executive Summary, July 2020
 Background-The Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Vital Statistics
Administration have worked jointly to implement the Maryland PRAMS project since
2000 through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). PRAMS surveys mothers 2-9 months after delivery about factors
before, during, and shortly after pregnancy that may have an impact on pregnancy
outcome. The program has also proven its capacity to implement survey supplements on
emerging issues including the influenza vaccine, Zika, disability, and opioid use.
 The Maryland PRAMS survey booklet is sent monthly to a sample of new mothers
along with an incentive (manicure file). The survey questionnaire, as well as other
PRAMS materials, is available in both English and Spanish. Each mother is sent up to
three surveys followed by a telephone interview if no written surveys have been
returned. A $100 gift card is given out monthly to a mother chosen randomly who has
completed the mail or phone survey. Maryland currently utilizes a stratified random
sample based on infant birth weight (over-selecting mothers who have delivered a low
birth weight infant under <2500 grams).
 Program Features-Maryland PRAMS data are analyzed annually and currently
include reports from 2001 to 2017 birth years. Focus Briefs on various topics are posted
on the PRAMS website at www.marylandprams.org. Human Subjects Training occurs
annually for all PRAMS staff and was last completed in July 2020.
 Number of Mothers Served-Approximately 2,000 new mothers are surveyed
annually. As of June 2020, 44,714 new mothers in Maryland have been mailed the
PRAMS survey since its inception. Annual weighted response rates from 2001-2017
births have met or exceeded the threshold.
 Budget-Maryland PRAMS is currently funded at $172,500 annually ($157,500 in core
funding and $15,000 in supplemental disability funding). We are currently in year five of
a five year cycle. This competitive application is for year one of the next 5 year grant
cycle. We will be requesting the ceiling award amount of $175,000."
11043476,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program is engaged in defining, evaluating, and implementing
novel interventions to reduce cancer incidence, minimize disease- and treatment-related symptoms, and
enhance overall survivorship. CPC investigators apply state-of-the-science agents, assays, and study designs
to advance the field in 2 prioritized areas: 1) Cancer Risk Reduction, including chemoprevention, tobacco
control, and cancer early detection research; and 2) Symptom Control & Survivorship, integrating basic,
clinical, and community-based studies to improve cancer care. This intentionally focused framework provides
an efficient structure for innovative, collaborative investigation in both the cancer prevention and cancer control
settings. CPC Risk Reduction research activities are concentrated on inhibiting preinvasive neoplasia,
precluding (or lowering) tobacco exposure, and identifying asymptomatic tumors at the earliest possible stage.
For Symptom Control and Survivorship, research activities are directed at eliminating or controlling untoward
symptoms related to disease progression or treatment, and optimizing quality and quantity of life following a
cancer diagnosis. To achieve its intended goals, the CPC Program has assembled an interdisciplinary team of
50 members from 20 departments across all 3 Mayo Clinic campuses. Total direct peer-reviewed funding is
$4.1M (54% from the NCI), and total direct funding is $5.2M. Since 2013, the Program has generated 661
publications, 26% reflecting intraprogrammatic collaborations and 33% reflecting interprogrammatic
collaborations. Notable contributions have been made with respect to each Program aim, as evidenced by the
incorporation of study results into chemoprevention agent development planning, clinical practice standards,
and public health policies. Dr. Loprinzi co-leads the CPC Program along with Dr. Limburg, who joined the
leadership dyad in June 2017. Under this leadership pairing, the Program has reorganized its research
activities to provide a strong foundation for accelerating impactful research and has also launched several new
initiatives to increase opportunities for collaboration between the CPC Program and other key internal and
external stakeholder groups. Major CPC Program activities anticipated for the next 5 years include further
conduct of cutting-edge, team-based research related to the discovery, translation, and application of
promising chemoprevention agents, cancer vaccines, tobacco cessation and nicotine avoidance strategies,
early-detection biomarkers, multi-organ screening approaches (such as “liquid biopsy”), imaging technologies,
symptom management, and survivorship care. The Program makes extensive use of Shared Resources, in
particular: Biospecimens Accessioning and Processing (BAP), Biostatistics (BSR), Genome Analysis
(GEN), Pharmacy (PHM) and the MCCC Clinical Research Office (CRO)."
11043477,"GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK ASSESSMENT PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY
The unifying goal of the Genetic Epidemiology and Risk Assessment (GERA) Program is the application of
genetic and molecular epidemiology methods to the study of critical questions addressing the etiology,
prognosis, and survivorship of cancer in human populations. More specifically, GERA members leverage the
combination of epidemiologic methods with high-resolution molecular techniques in order to identify risk and
prognostic factors; improve risk stratification; and provide an evidence base for primary, secondary, and
tertiary prevention strategies. This goal is further accelerated by applying novel and innovative methods from
statistics and informatics. To address these fundamental questions, 3 scientific aims have been developed: 1)
To use the tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology to understand genetic, environmental, and
gene–environment interactions in the etiology of cancer in human populations; 2) To use these same advances
to understand the molecular epidemiology of cancer prognosis and survivorship; and 3) To develop and apply
novel statistical and informatics methods for the design and analysis of genetic and molecular epidemiology
studies. The GERA Program's cancer etiology studies use family-based, case-control, and cohort study
designs and focus on the genetic epidemiology of cancer, premalignant conditions, and intermediate
phenotypes, as well as nongenetic risk factors and descriptive epidemiology. Etiologic heterogeneity based on
tumor phenotype is also being addressed. Cancer prognosis research focuses on host factors, including
genetic and serum biomarkers as well as lifestyle factors that influence prognosis; tumor biomarkers; and
survivorship. Novel methods for the design and analysis of genetic and molecular epidemiologic studies are
being developed, building on our expertise in biostatistics, medical informatics, and bioinformatics. To achieve
these goals we have assembled a team of 29 multidisciplinary members from 4 departments from all 3
campuses. Total direct peer-reviewed funding is $3.6M (79% from the NCI), with total direct funding of $5.4M.
Since 2013, the program has generated 744 publications, 36% reflecting intraprogrammatic collaborations and
59% reflecting interprogrammatic collaborations. Notable contributions have been made in the epidemiology of
pancreatic, lung, ovarian, breast, colon, prostate, and lymphoproliferative malignancies as well as to the
statistical genetics and medical and bioinformatics literature. Leadership of the program is provided by Drs.
Cerhan, Parker, and Yang. The Program makes extensive use of Shared Resources. In the next 5 years, we
will facilitate innovative research in cancer etiology and prognosis with a focus on genomics and related omics
fields, development and application of novel technologies and methods, and translation to the clinic and
population as well as back to the lab to inform biology."
11043481,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT PROJECT SUMMARY
The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) functions are
administratively overseen by the MCCC Clinical Research Committee (Chaired by the MCCC Deputy Director
for Clinical Research) and functionally coordinated by the MCCC Clinical Research Office (CRO), the Data and
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The CPDM
functions include clinical research operations and data quality monitoring, facilitated by the Medical Director
and Administrative Director and supported by the CRO staff. The CRO carries out development, activation,
study maintenance, study coordination, administration, and reporting for all cancer clinical trials conducted at
the MCCC. In addition, the CRO provides operational support for the Protocol Review and Monitoring System
(PRMS) and the Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) System. The CPDM and DSM functions at MCCC are
distinct from PRMS functions, with minor overlap of membership. Staff in the CRO work collaboratively with the
MCCC clinical investigators to provide expert, efficient support in the conduct of clinical research across the
enterprise and with individual Disease Groups to ensure efficient development and activation of clinical trials
consistent with the priorities of the MCCC Programs.
Over the past grant period, the CRO has overseen the development and activation of 617 studies, including an
increasingly complex portfolio of studies (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cells, basket and umbrella trials
with targeted therapies). It has provided staffing support in alignment with the growth of the Disease Groups,
facilitated the opening of a wide variety of trials in line with Disease Group growth strategies, and maintained
stable clinical trial accrual volumes over the last 3 years. With the creation of the integrated Early Cancer
Therapeutics (ECTx) unit and the growth of the Cellular Therapy Disease Group, the CRO continues to evolve
to efficiently support novel, complex, and innovative trials. Significant progress has been made to improve the
clinical trial activation process to address efficiency, time to activation, and quality. Ongoing developments will
include the implementation of a new clinical research management system.
MCCC provides oversight for participant safety through the Center's DSM system, with functions carried out by
the DSMC and the DSMB. The DSMC focuses broadly on safety rather than on individual studies. It evaluates
trends in protocol deviations and toxicities and recommends MCCC-wide procedural changes aimed at
ensuring that studies are conducted in accordance with MCCC's Data Safety and Monitoring Plan and with
federal, local, and institutional policies. The DSMC also reviews the DSM Plan annually and oversees the
DSMB functions. The DSMB focuses their review on individual studies, ensuring patient safety by regularly
reviewing adverse events on study and responses to the study intervention for individual trials."
10764273,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The primary goal of this project is to leverage large, harmonized data resources comprised of a broad range
of patients with heart failure (HF) by using machine learning (ML) to develop and test complex models to predict
clinical outcomes and identify HF phenotypes that may be clinically important based on pathophysiology,
prognosis, and treatment response. We will accomplish this through secondary analysis of 25 clinical trials, 6
large epidemiologic studies, and electronic health record data totaling ~ 130,000 patients with HF. Of these >
40,270 are derived from 21 BioLINCC datasets, 43,536 from industry-sponsored studies and 45,763 from the
EHR. By utilizing a variety of studies with respect to population, design, timeframe, and data source, we envisage
that our phenotypes will be a) more reflective of the spectrum of patients encountered in real world clinical
practice and b) able to be identified more consistently with routinely collected clinical data. Improved
characterization of outcomes according to HF phenotype may in turn facilitate personalization of HF
management both in terms of therapies and treatment goals. We hypothesize that predictive and phenotyping
models generated using these resources will outperform existing models across a range of data sources and
clinical populations. The primary overlapping Aims of this proposal are:
 1. Use data from 74,308 patients in 25 completed clinical trials to characterize survival and
 treatment response according to simple characteristics, predictive models, and complex
 phenotypes. We apply both supervised and unsupervised ML methods to this dataset in one of the
 largest individual patient data meta-analyses of HF clinical trial data to date. We will then compare the
 predictive value of these models to established models derived using conventional regression and
 survival analysis.
 2. Validate models from Aim 1, explore novel phenotypes, and describe associated clinical
 characteristics prior to HF diagnosis in 9,734 patients with incident HF from observational cohorts.
 Using data from 6 large studies such as the Framingham Heart Study, we will validate established models
 and models from Aim 1. We will also identify major phenotypes not well represented in clinical trials and
 attempt to identify clinical risk factors that precede development of specific HF phenotypes.
 3. Validate phenotype characteristics, associations, and outcomes in 45,763 patients with HF using
 retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data from the University of Colorado's clinical data
 warehouse. We will test all predictive and patient phenotype models derived in Aims 1 and 2 using these
 harmonized real-world data and again identify phenotypes not well-represented in other the datasets.
 Because of known health disparities in clinical practice, we will describe care patterns according to patient
 phenotype that may impact outcomes."
10798127,"ABSTRACT
High optical transparency, low light-scattering and low autofluorescence of mammalian tissues in the near-
infrared spectral range open up the possibility for non-invasive imaging, sensing and light-regulation of cellular
biochemistry, tissue metabolism and physiology in mammals. Due to near-infrared absorption and the use of
heme-derived biliverdin produced in all mammalian tissues as a chromophore, bacterial phytochromes are
currently the preferred molecular templates for the development of genetically encoded optical reagents for in
vivo applications. Here we propose a variety of near-infrared imaging probes and optogenetic tools. We will
focus on the development of fluorescent proteins with higher brightness, greater bathochromic shift and
exhibiting photoconversion, as well as on the search for new natural near-infrared absorbing proteins as initial
templates. These probes should lead to deeper and spatiotemporally precise in vivo imaging. We will also
focus on the visualization and manipulation of endogenous molecules in cells and whole organisms using
antigen-stabilized fusions of near-infrared fluorescent proteins with genetically encoded nanobodies. This will
allow background-free detection of various intracellular antigens and antigen-dependent regulation of protein
and cellular functions. In addition, we will develop near-infrared optogenetic modules with improved
performance in mammalian cells and use them to engineer light-controlled enzymes, receptors and cells. This
should open up possibilities for user-defined regulation of cellular and organismal functions in vivo. All
proposed near-infrared probes will spectrally complement existing reagents in the visible range. Planned
studies will also expand our basic knowledge of photochemistry and light-induced signaling of phytochrome
photoreceptors. Novel genetically encoded fluorescent probes and optogenetic tools will drive the development
of more sensitive in vivo imaging and light-control technologies, optimization of gene delivery strategies,
development of targeted non-invasive illumination, and refinement of optical readouts in tissues and animals."

10757732,"ABSTRACT - In the post-ischemic heart, relatively little is known about the injured-but-not-infarcted myocardium,
which we call the intermediate zone as it is neither normal nor infarcted. We recently identified compelling
evidence that the intermediate zone is not merely a ""lesser infarct"", but has a set of unique pathological
characteristics and contributes significantly to cardiac impairment. These novel discoveries were made possible
by overcoming a technological challenge. We developed a high-sensitivity phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-
based imaging technique, enabling the mapping of the intermediate zone which is otherwise missed by
conventional methods. Using imaging-guided pathological analyses, we discovered that, in contrast to the infarct
zone where there is necrosis across all cell types, in the intermediate zone different cell types survive differently.
This disparity between surviving cardiomyocytes (residual contractility) and loss of sympathetic neurons
(dysinnervation) creates chaos in electrophysiology. Chronically, the intermediate zone exhibits functional
deficiency with signaling activation associated with hypertrophy. The data strongly support that the intermediate
zone has significant contractile dysfunction as well as being a substrate for arrhythmias. As such, there are
significant prognostic values both for assessing the full scope of myocardial impairment and for predicting the
risk for arrhythmias. Based on these findings, we propose a central hypothesis that the intermediate zone
constitutes a distinct pathological entity which contributes to cardiac dysfunction in the post-ischemic heart. The
hypothesis will be tested in three integrated and synergistic Specific Aims: 1) to refine the in vivo imaging
methodology for mapping the intermediate zone, and characterize the pathology of this tissue in an imaging-
guided approach; 2) to determine the signaling changes in the intermediate zone; and 3) to investigate the roles
of the intermediate zone in arrhythmogenesis. Collectively, the ability to positively identify the intermediate zone
in vivo provides a critical technological breakthrough. By understanding the signaling, pathological and functional
changes in this tissue, our findings will ultimately have a transformative impact on enriching the knowledge base
and shaping clinical practices in ACS."
10751052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Food allergy (FA) and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common chronic conditions of atopy affecting 10% and 20%
of children, respectively. Individuals with FA are at daily risk for potentially life-threatening hives, angioedema,
respiratory difficulty, cardiovascular compromise, gastrointestinal distress, and/or anaphylaxis following
ingestion of a food antigen to which they are sensitized. Individuals with AD must live with chronically pruritic,
inflamed skin that can cover a significant proportion of their bodies and become infected. The development of
FA is frequently preceded by AD, suggesting shared risk factors and overlapping pathobiology. FA and AD are
complex diseases, and parsing the biological heterogeneity hidden under their clinical umbrellas is paramount
to improving their prevention, diagnosis, and clinical management. A systems biology approach where the
biology of FA and AD are investigated comprehensively at several levels may help identify new knowledge
about the development of allergy. Systems Biology of Early Atopy (SunBEAm) is a general population pre-birth
cohort study initiated by the NIAID to study the role and inter-relationships of genetic, clinical, biological, and
environmental early-life factors in the development of allergic diseases, with an emphasis on FA and AD.
Pregnant women, children born to them, and the children's biological fathers are being enrolled and
phenotyped with longitudinal biosample collections. A central goal of SunBEAm is to apply systems biology to
identify mechanisms and biomarkers underlying the development of FA, AD, and their endotypes. The
overarching goal of this SunBEAm Analysis & Bioinformatics Center (ABC) application is to create a
center for assaying SunBEAm biosamples using omics, and to apply integrative systems biology to
identify novel determinants of FA and AD. Our application centers on these five specific aims: (1) Assay
biosamples from SunBEAm participants to generate longitudinal, multi-scale omic data that will inform on the
development of FA and AD; (2) Analyze the systems-wide omic data generated to identify novel biomarkers,
endotypes, and mechanisms underlying the development of FA and AD; (3) Integrate data across molecular
dimensions to identify key drivers and predictors of FA and AD development; (4) Share all generated data,
create a centralized platform for SunBEAm data and bioinformatic innovations, and build capacity for the
integration of future SunBEAm omics data; and (5) Develop infrastructure for interactions with the SunBEAm
Steering Group, the NIAID Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center, and NIAID. With this award, we will
create a center for unprecedented systems allergy research. In addition to an investigator team with world-
class expertise in multi-omics, systems biology, computational biology, data science, and bioinformatics, our
team also includes physician-scientists and immunologists who directly designed and continue to actively drive
the ongoing enrollment and implementation of SunBEAm. Our team's experience, expertise, and proven track
record will ensure the success of SunBEAm-ABC."
10865092,"A central goal of neuroscience is to discover how neural circuits control the body’s muscles to produce behavior.
However, despite recent advances in tools for studying brain activity, methods for examining the signals that
actually control behavior – spiking activity in muscle fibers – have advanced little since the 1950s, fundamentally
limiting our understanding of how the brain controls the body. By combining our expertise in electrophysiology
(Dr. Sober) and engineering (Dr. Bakir), we have created a new generation of microscale, high channel-count
electrode arrays that record muscle activity at unprecedented scale and resolution (single-unit spike trains in
muscle fibers) in freely behaving animals and from a range of species including mice, rats, songbirds, and
nonhuman primates. This technology is impactful because it allows precise monitoring of motor output in
conjunction with recording and manipulation of central neural circuits, consistent with the BRAIN Initiative’s goal
to reveal how patterns of activity in the central nervous system are transformed into motor behavior. To create
our tools, we have established a design, fabrication, and testing pipeline to create a number of well-tested
electrode designs that target forelimb, vocal, and orofacial muscles. Moreover, we surveyed the broader
community of researchers examining motor behavior to identify the shortcomings of current methods and to
prioritize array designs to address the same. We therefore propose to fabricate and distribute at least 2,500 of
our current devices to 100 researchers worldwide (Aim 1) and to develop virtual and in-person training modules
to teach users how to use our new technology (Aim 2) efficiently and at scale."
10895282,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently, synthetic cooling agents, WS-3 (N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide) and WS-23 (2-isopropyl-N,2,3
trimethylbutyramide), that solely impart a cooling sensation without a mint flavor, have been detected in e-
cigarettes (ECs) and are marketed with “ice” as part of the flavor name (e.g., “watermelon ice”). Unlike menthol,
synthetic cooling agents can be added at very high concentrations (>5% by weight) to e-liquids allowing users
to get extreme cooling/anesthetic properties during vaping, without menthol’s unappealing properties (e.g., eye-
watering, harshness). Synthetic cooling agents have the potential to increase indirect and direct harm to EC
users. The proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate the effects of synthetic cooling agents on
the appeal, puffing behavior, and toxicity of vaping. We will use a single-blind randomized crossover trial with
young adult vapers (N = 120, aged 21-29 years), precisely manipulated e-liquids, a well-characterized
commercial EC device, validated psycho-behavioral measures, and a novel puff-playback method to estimate
human exposures to HPHCs and other toxicants from vaping e-liquids with and without synthetic cooling agents
(i.e., WS-3 and WS-23). Specifically, we aim to determine the impact of e-liquids with (mango ice, tobacco ice)
and without (mango, tobacco) the presence of synthetic cooling agents on abuse liability (appeal, sensory
effects, demand), EC puffing behavior (i.e., EC topography), and toxicant exposure (harmful and potential
harmful constituents). Additionally, topography data collected for all participants for each of the conditions vaped
will be averaged to produce four human-derived puffing regimens. Machine vaping will be conducted for each of
the four e-liquids using the associated human-derived puffing regimens to determine the range of HPHCs and
other toxicants in mainstream EC vapor. Findings would immediately inform the evidence base needed to inform
FDA rulemaking surrounding the use of synthetic cooling agent additives in EC products."

The vision of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) is to develop collaborative approaches for data management and sharing through inclusion of established generalist repositories in the NIH data ecosystem and better enable search and discovery of NIH funded data in the generalist repositories. This is one of the steps in the modernization of the data resources ecosystem and aligns with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science.
The primary mission of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative is to establish a common set of cohesive and consistent capabilities, services, metrics, and social infrastructure across various generalist repositories. A secondary mission is to also raise general awareness and facilitate researchers to adopt FAIR principles to better share and reuse data.
The objectives of the project are to work together with the other awardee teams to develop a “co-opetition plan” that include a commitment to a solution architecture, data submission and QA/QC capabilities to support relevant use cases, train and educate users, as well as provide usage analytics and reporting to the NIH."
10737643,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in immunocompromised patients and results in neurodevelopmental abnormalities in infants and children infected in-utero. Currently there is no licensed vaccine and antiviral therapies have dose limiting toxicities. Thus, further understanding of the replication of this virus, including mechanisms of virion envelopment, could identify new strategies for vaccine and antiviral drug development. In this proposal, we will define interactions between an essential virion glycoprotein complex, gM/gN, and membrane associated outer tegument proteins that lead to envelopment of the virus in a specialized cellular compartment, the assembly compartment. Recombinant viruses with specific mutations in envelope and outer tegument proteins that result in shared phenotypes of defective envelopment will be used to define of viral glycoprotein/ tegument protein interactions required for virion assembly. In addition to increasing current understanding of herpesvirus assembly, results from these studies could potentially identify novel targets for development of therapeutics to limit replication of this virus."

Endometriosis is a debilitating disease involving the growth of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus.
The primary symptoms are pelvic pain and infertility. Nearly half of affected women have chronic pelvic pain,
and in 70% of those, the pain occurs during menstruation. Pain with sex (“dyspareunia”) and infertility occur in
close to half of women affected by endometriosis. Less common symptoms include urinary or bowel symptoms.
About 25% of women have no symptoms. Endometriosis can have both social and psychological effects.
Currently, definitive diagnosis is achieved by surgical biopsy. Because of the invasive nature of this method, the
diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis is considerably delayed, with average time from symptom onset to
diagnosis being 10 years. The consequence of this significant delay is prolonged and progressive pain, a risk of
infertility and considerable social/economic impact.
The purpose of this study is to develop non-invasive screening methods for the early detection of endometriosis.
Specifically, we will target DNA methylation signatures carried by circulating fragments of extracellular DNA,
referred to herein as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). These fragments, which are detected in a variety of fluid reservoirs
including blood plasma, convey epigenomic information both about their cell type of origin and its pathological
state. Our over-arching hypothesis is that altered DNA methylation signatures in the uterine tissue of
endometriosis patients are detectable via analysis of plasma-derived cfDNA. In this study we will build a
foundation of preliminary data towards the development of methods for the early non-invasive detection of
endometriosis."

 Cardiac electrical rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) contribute to over 500,000 deaths each year in
patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite considerable advances in defining the specific cell- and
organ-level remodeling changes associated with CVD, the precise mechanisms driving increased susceptibility
to arrhythmia remain to be defined. At the same time, existing anti-arrhythmic therapies are limited by efficacy,
low patient tolerance, risk of procedural complications, and/or cost. In particular, the development of new anti-
arrhythmic drugs has been hampered by high profile failed clinical trials involving compounds that target major
cardiac ion channels, leading to a shift away from the pursuit of population wide, “blockbuster” therapies and
towards more precise, patient-specific approaches. Essential for this effort will be the development of novel
adjuvant therapies that tune cardiac excitability without introducing large scale perturbations in the cardiac action
potential. Here, we explore the two-pore K+ channel TREK-1 as an ideal, although understudied, candidate for
next generation “precision” therapeutics based on: 1) endogenous expression in cardiomyocytes across species,
including mouse and human; 2) multiple regulatory modes for tuning of channel activity; and 3) recent emergence
as a highly druggable target. Importantly, TREK-1 is sensitive to a wide range of environmental stimuli, including
mechanical membrane deformation, β-adrenergic stimulation, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and intracellular pH.
While defects in TREK-1 expression/function have been identified in inherited and acquired models of arrhythmia
and in human patients, little is known about the mechanism linking neurohumoral/biomechanical stress stimuli
to TREK-1 dysfunction, or the specific role for TREK-1 in modulating arrhythmia risk. This proposal is further
motivated by mounting data that TREK-1 displays noncanonical activity beyond its primary function as a
repolarizing K+ current. At the same time, our unexpected preliminary data indicate that TREK-1 ion selectivity
depends on the integrity of the spectrin-based cytoskeleton in cardiac myocytes. Together, these findings provide
a potential link between stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton, TREK-1 dysfunction and downstream
remodeling relevant to arrhythmia in the setting of CVD. Our long-term goal is to define new regulatory pathways
underlying adverse remodeling and arrhythmia in the setting of CVD, and to identify novel anti-arrhythmia
strategies in CVD patients. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TREK-1 functions as a multimodal
stress sensor in heart, as well as therapeutic “lever” that may be tuned to modulate cardiac excitability through
association with the spectin-based cytoskeleton. Further, we expect that chronic biomechanical/neurohumoral
stress induces noncanonical TREK-1 activity thereby promoting dysregulation of ion homeostasis in cardiac
myocytes and increased risk for arrhythmia."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are genome-derived, functional noncoding RNA (ncRNA) molecules that
govern posttranscriptional regulation of target gene expression in cells. Our long-term objective is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of miRNA-controlled regulation of xenobiotic & nutrient disposition and drug
actions towards the development of new therapeutic strategies. My laboratory pioneered the research on
miRNA pharmacoepigenetics that has offered new insights into inter-individual variability in drug disposition
and response. Since the diseased carcinoma cells are addicted to continuous supply and metabolism of key
xenobiotic nutrients (e.g., amino acids or AAs, vitamins, sugars, etc.) for uncontrolled proliferation and
tumorigenesis, understanding the roles of metabolic enzymes (e.g., pyridoxine-5-prime-phosphate oxidase
or PNPO) and transporters (e.g., AA transporter SLC7A5/LAT1, glucose transporter SLC2A1/GLUT1, etc.)
in nutrient metabolism and transport may help to identify new therapeutic targets. Yet, there is a critical gap
in the understanding of important regulatory factors and mechanisms underlying key nutrients’ disposition
and homeostasis in carcinoma cells. In addition, current research on miRNA functions and therapeutics are
limited to the use of chemo-engineered miRNA “mimics” made in vitro and comprised of extensive and
various types of chemical modifications, which are completely different from natural RNA molecules
produced and folded in living cells without any or just carrying a limited number of posttranscriptional
modifications. This is also in sharp contrast to protein research and therapy that have found ultimate
success by using recombinant or bioengineered proteins produced and folded in living cells, rather than
polypeptides or proteins synthesized chemically in vitro. Very recently, we have established a novel
tRNA/pre-miRNA-based RNA bioengineering technology that permits high-yield and large-scale production
of recombinant miRNA agents through in vivo bacterial fermentation. Our studies have showed that
recombinant miRNAs are biologically active in regulating target gene expression in human cells, and
subsequently modulate drug disposition and response. Furthermore, our preliminary studies have revealed
that particular human tRNA (htRNA) can be coupled with human pre-miRNA (hsa-pre-miR) as novel carriers
for the production of fully-humanized recombinant or bioengineered miRNA agents, namely
hBERA/miRNA. Therefore, in this application, we proposed to (1) establish and utilize novel ncRNA carriers
to produce a collection of recombinant hBERA/miRNA molecules (Aim 1), (2) delineate the mechanistic
actions of recombinant miRNAs in the control of cellular vitamin B6 metabolism and AA
metabolome/homeostasis (Aim 2), and (3) define the effectiveness of recombinant miRNAs in the
modulation of pharmacodynamics in disease animal models in vivo (Aim 3). The proposed research will
establish a one-of-a-kind RNA biotechnology, and define the mechanistic actions of several human miRNAs
in the control of xenobiotic/nutrient metabolism as well as their applications to improving drug efficacy."
10843054,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genomic DNA is the information repository of the cell, encoding the myriad of proteins required to sustain life.
To harness this information, cells depend on RNA polymerases - dynamic biomolecular machines that first
transcribe the genetic code into RNA. Transcription is a complex and highly regulated process that governs cell
growth, differentiation, development and all responses to environmental change. Importantly, the biochemical
pathways that orchestrate the expression and repair of genes are intricately intertwined. As a consequence,
many human diseases trace their origins to deficiencies in gene regulation or DNA repair. Understanding the
molecular-level mechanisms that underlie gene expression and transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) is a
grand challenge in biomedical science. Progress toward this goal has been hindered by the size, complexity and
dynamic nature of the assemblies that accomplish transcription and TCR. In initial studies with our experimental
collaborators we combined computational modeling with cryo-electron microscopy data to determine structures
of transcription preinitiation complexes (PICs) from all three classes of RNA polymerases (Pol I, Pol II and Pol
III). The structures captured the PICs in multiple functional states covering the path from promoter recognition to
the formation of a proficient elongation complex. These results offer an unprecedented opportunity for integrative
modeling to connect the experimentally observed states, delineate DNA remodeling during the early stages of
transcription and uncover the critical mechanisms of transcription regulation. Specifically, we will leverage
computational and structural systems biology approaches to 1) determine how the Pol I, II and III transcription
machineries recognize and open promoter DNA; 2) examine how the transcription factor TFIID associates with
promoter DNA and serves as a platform for assembling the PIC; and 3) uncover the key functions of two
recognized TCR master coordinators, transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and Cockayne Syndrome B protein (CSB).
Our work will benefit from synergistic collaborative interactions with world-class experimental groups to inform,
validate, and extend our models. Parallel advances in computation and cryo-EM will yield key insights into the
structure, dynamics and function of gene regulatory complexes while making direct connection to genetic disease
phenotypes. Success of the project will thus have major impacts - both in understanding the etiology of cancers
and inherited genetic disorders and in offering a structural framework to devise effective treatments."

Organ transplantation is a critical therapy for patients with irreversible organ damage. Short-term outcomes are
excellent, but most patients lose their organs eventually due to chronic immune-mediated injury over time.
Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is unavoidable in transplantation and the primary activator of the innate
immune response in the early post-transplant period, which enhances the rates of acute and chronic allograft
rejection subsequently. Furthermore, a critical worldwide shortage of organs available for transplant exists,
which has prompted clinicians to use organs from donors who are older or have greater comorbidity. These
organs have much greater susceptibility to ischemic injuries. Therefore, the association of IRI with increased
allograft immunogenicity has very broad clinical implications. Costimulatory blockade (CB) has emerged
recently as a highly promising therapeutic approach in transplantation with far superior microvascular and
metabolic safety profile than calcineurin inhibitors. However, CB is associated with increased rates of acute
allograft rejection during the early post-transplantation phase. Our data indicate that IRI abrogates the
tolerogenic effect of CB. Therefore, a key unmet need in transplantation is to understand better the
mechanisms by which IRI and its activation of the innate immune response potentiates transplant rejection, as
novel therapeutic regimens to prevent or ameliorate IRI-induced alloimmunity could assist in reducing chronic
rejection. Our main goal is to reveal the underlying mechanisms of augmentation of transplant rejection by IRI.
Pursuant to our data, our main hypothesis is that IRI activates alloimmunity by A) increasing the early intra-
graft inflammatory response and B) priming the draining lymph node (DLN) of the graft recipient through
distinctive microanatomical changes. We have shown that early intra-graft inflammatory responses play a
critical role in augmenting alloimmunity. We also propose here for the first-time the use of nanoparticles for
targeted delivery of immune therapeutics to the DLN for the reduction of IRI-induced alloimmunity. In AIM 1,
we will examine how induction of autophagy in donor dendritic cells by IRI creates a pro-inflammatory milieu
within the organs that augments alloimmunity. In AIM 2, we will examine the mechanism by which IRI of the
grafts primes the DLN microanatomically to amplify the alloimmune response. In AIM 3, we will develop
nanoparticles for the targeted delivery of CB to the DLN for augmentation of their tolerogenic effects in
reducing the deleterious effects of IRI."
10789887,"Genetically identical cells in the same environment can have large cell-to-cell differences in gene expression. A major reason for these differences is that transcription occurs in stochastic “bursts” of activity. Stochastic bursts of expression diversify cell types during development, contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer cells, and hinder the production of pure cell types in reprogramming experiments. Although bursting is an important property of gene expression in development and disease, the molecular causes of cell to- cell variability in expression remain poorly understood. Both the mean expression levels and cell-to-cell variability of genes are important in development. A key experimental observation is that genes with the same mean expression can have different cell-to-cell variability. Therefore, molecular mechanisms must have evolved to uncouple the regulation of cell-to-cell variability from mean expression levels. How cells can control cell-to-cell variability without influencing mean expression is unknown. We propose to use the “Bursty Model” of expression as a framework for separating the regulation of cell to- cell variability from mean expression levels. The Bursty Model suggests that the mean and variability of expression can be separated through independent control of a gene’s “burst size'' (the number of mRNAs produced per burst) and “burst frequency” (the time between bursts). Genes producing large but infrequent bursts (developmental regulators) would have both high mean levels and high cell-to-cell variability, while genes with smaller more frequent bursts (metabolic enzymes) could reach the same mean levels with much less variability. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms that separate the control of burst size and frequency would be an important step towards explaining the independent control of mean and variability in expression. We propose to determine whether perturbations to different transcription factor (TF) functions have separable effects on burst size and frequency. Successful completion of our aims would help uncouple the regulation of mean levels from cell-to-cell variability. The results would 1) inform whether natural selection can alter cell-to-cell variability independent of mean levels, 2) shed light on regulatory mechanisms that generate high variability during cell fate decisions, and 3) suggest ways to suppress cell-to-cell variability in applications that rely on the ectopic expression of TFs."

10804641,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The innate immune system is best known as an essential defense against invading microbes. In humans,
this response requires an immediate and concerted action by both humoral and cellular components, which are
represented by the complement system and neutrophils, respectively. Efficient killing of microbes by this so-
called “complement/neutrophil axis” is predicated upon a highly orchestrated and stepwise series of molecular
recognition events and biochemical transformations, which at their most fundamental level involve enzymes.
 As a consequence of host/pathogen co-evolution, the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus
has developed a powerful array of small protein inhibitors that block many of the central enzymatic players of
the innate immune response. In this regard, we identified three secreted staphylococcal proteins, called Eap,
EapH1, and EapH2 (denoted “EAP proteins”), which potently inhibit three different proteases known as
Neutrophil Serine Proteases (NSPs) that are critical components of the neutrophil's anti-bacterial arsenal. In
addition to this, Eap itself also inhibits assembly of a multi-subunit protease system that is required for function
of the classical and lectin complement pathways. Separately, we also identified a new staphylococcal protein,
called “SPIN”, that is a potent inhibitor of the HOCl-generating myeloperoxidase (MPO) found in neutrophils.
Collectively, these S. aureus proteins interfere with bacterial killing in both in vitro systems and animal models.
 While our initial studies on EAP proteins and SPIN have provided important information on the structure,
function, and mechanism of these novel enzyme inhibitors, many significant questions still remain. In this project,
we will employ a combination of structural, biochemical, functional, and informatics approaches to address these
issues. In the first series of investigations, we will determine how the individual repeating domains of S. aureus
Eap inhibit NSPs. This will provide a means for comparative analysis to the Eap homologs, EapH1 and EapH2,
which are more extensively characterized. We will also work to define the structural determinants within Eap that
allow this protein, but not EapH1 or EapH2, to inhibit the complement system in addition to NSPs. In the second
series of investigations, we will explore the structural transitions that allow SPIN to adopt an inhibitory
conformation upon binding to MPO. We will also define the structural determinants within SPIN proteins that
provide an exquisite level of selectivity for MPO when compared to closely related heme peroxidases. In our final
series of studies, we will leverage our extensive structural and functional data on SPINs and staphylococcal
complement inhibitors toward establishing a paradigm for understanding the physical basis for host species
specificity of virulence proteins. By completing this research plan, we will further our understanding of two novel
classes of enzyme inhibitors that function at the host/pathogen interface, and lay the basic science foundation
for future development of anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory therapies arising from the information we uncover."

Segregation distorters are selfish genetic elements that operate by over-representing themselves in the mature
gamete pool, thus fundamentally violating Mendel’s law. The evolutionary arms races triggered between
distorter genes and their suppressors have long been recognized as a powerful force that shapes the evolution
of genomes, cells, and species. Despite the ubiquity and importance of segregation distorters, we understand
very little about the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of this class of selfish genetic elements. A key
barrier in understanding the mechanisms of segregation distorters is that they are present in non-model
systems that lack genetic tools, and are almost always associated with chromosomal inversions that thwart
traditional genetic approaches to gene discovery. Without characterizing the underlying genetic basis and
molecular mechanisms it remains impossible to directly connect the arms race initiated by selfish elements to
broader phenomena in the evolution of meiosis and sex chromosome systems.
Here, we develop two independent methods to side-step traditional barriers presented by chromosomal
inversions to gene discovery, and dissect the genetic basis underlying this selfish behavior in closely related
Drosophila species. In our first aim, we develop a mutagenesis approach to identify the genes causing Sex-
Ratio distortion in D. pseudoobscura. Through a combination of sequencing, in silico complementation, bulked-
segregant mapping, and CRISPR/ Cas9 based editing, we are poised to resolve the complex genetic
architecture that underlies distortion and to identify the complete set of genes, including modifiers and
enhancers, that drive the selfish behavior of the D. pseudoobscura Sex-Ratio chromosome. In our second aim,
we uncover cryptic variation within species for suppressors of distortion. Here, we aim to understand the
molecular arms races between distorters and their suppressors through the identification of the genes and
mechanisms of suppression of segregation distortion, and suppressors of suppressors-of-distortion. In our third
aim, we engineer a synthetic chromosomal inversion to allow recombination mapping of Sex-Ratio distortion in
D. persimilis. This approach adapts the Flp/FRT site-specific recombination tools to generate a perfectly
collinear non-driving chromosome to allow free recombination in the region containing all necessary and
sufficient genes for SR distortion. Once candidate genes are mapped, validated, and organized into a
functional pathway for D. persimilis, a comparative analysis of these two systems will test whether SR
mechanisms are unique or shared. Together, this work will provide the most complete genetic architecture of
sex-linked segregation distorters to date, open the door to understanding the molecular mechanisms of
distortion in two Sex-Ratio systems, and for the first time explicitly test independent or shared origins and
mechanisms of Sex-Ratio distortion in these closely related species."

Despite improvements in treatment, clinical outcomes for late stage breast cancer (BC) remain poor and there
is a critical need for new therapies for metastatic disease. Hyperactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
signaling in BC is associated with poor prognosis yet direct RTK inhibitors have had mixed results in clinical
trials. RTK signaling drives anoikis resistance, a key metastasis-enabling biology. Thus, defining the underlying
mechanisms of this process could identify new druggable targets to treat metastasis. Sphingolipids (SL) are a
family of bioactive lipids, classically implicated in cell death, and whose metabolism is altered in cancer.
Ongoing studies from the PI’s group, using HER2 amplification as a model system of RTK signaling have
identified the SL enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1) as a key HER2-regulated node in the SL
network that was required for anoikis resistance of HER2+ BC cells. In clinical data, high DES1 levels were
associated with worse outcomes in HER2+ BC. Moreover, increasing DES1 levels was sufficient to drive in
vitro tumorigenicity of HER2+ BC cells whereas DES1 KO reduced in vivo metastasis. Taken together, these
novel data have led us to the central hypothesis that DES1 is necessary and sufficient to promote RTK-
driven anoikis resistance and metastasis which will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. The first aim
will define the role of DES1 in RTK-driven anoikis resistance in vitro and in vivo using Crispr/Cas9
technology to knockout DES1 in RTK-driven BC cells and defining biological effects on in vitro tumorigenicity
and in vivo cell survival in the circulation. The second aim will define the mechanism(s) by which RTKs
regulate and maintains DES1 activity following ECM detachment using gain of function and loss of
function approaches to directly connect DES1 with oncogenic activation of PI3K signaling and the pentose
phosphate pathway. The third aim will establish DES1 as a driver of in vivo metastasis and
chemoresistance in BC harboring RTK hyperactivation using gain of function approaches to show that
increased DES1 is sufficient to promote an aggressive phenotype in RTK-activated BC and can mediate
resistance to the targeted HER2 therapy lapatinib. Collectively, these studies will establish DES1 as a key
effector of oncogenic RTK signaling and as a novel druggable target, effective at overcoming anoikis
resistance and useful for treatment of metastatic BC."

more than 50% of prostate cancer patients. Development of radiation technology, such as utilizing intensity-
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to deliver highly conformal radiation dose distributions and image-guided
radiotherapy (IGRT) to account for daily changes in target anatomy and positioning, allows unprecedented levels
of accuracy and therapy outcome. The prostate is surrounded by many nerves and muscle fibers controlling
different excretory and erectile functions that are difficult but necessary to avoid, it still remains a challenge to
precisely deliver radiation doses to prostate cancer without damaging the normal surrounding tissues even with
image guidance. To avoid excessive irradiation doses, radiosensitizers have been developed to amplify the
effects of radiation within tumor cells. Prostate cancer targeted radiosensitizers may offer a means for further
relative biological dose escalation with sparing of normal tissue. However, there has been limited preclinical and
clinical investigation of targeted radiosensitizers for prostate cancer. To address the challenge, we aim to
develop a nanoparticle technology that will improve prostate cancer tissue visualization and discrimination by
MRI, allowing greater accuracy in MRI-guided radiation therapy, and provide radiosensitization within the cancer
cells.
 Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an ideal target to detect prostate cancer due to its
abundant expression in most prostate cancers. We have synthesized a novel high-affinity ligand for PSMA
targeting, and conjugated both targeting ligand and Gd(III) complex to gold nanoparticles and nanoclusters
(AuNP/NCs). We have demonstrated that these PSMA-targeted AuNP/NC-Gd(III) have a much higher relaxivity
than free Gd(III) agents and the NP/NCs can be selectively delivered to PSMA-expressing prostate tumor cells,
providing MR image-guided radiation therapy. By delivering Gd(III) conjugated AuNP/NCs directly to prostate
cancer cells we will 1) concentrate the Gd(III) agent to the nanoparticle surface while simultaneously calibrating
the delivery of more Gd(III) agent to target tissues and less of the agent to non-specific or off-target sites; 2)
improve r1 relaxivity and MR sensitivity, which potentially can reduce the given doses to patients and potentially
toxicity of Gd(III) agents; 3) discriminate among cancerous, normal, neural, and muscle cells and tissues with
MRI, enabling precise diagnosis of prostate cancer and precision radiation therapy; 4) combine gold and
gadolinium together to enhance the radiosensitizing effect for potential ablation of prostate cancer using a lower
radiation dose; and 5) enable MRI-guided radiotherapy using MRI LINAC device to enhance radiation accuracy
and avoid collateral damage to normal tissues. We believe that this approach will impact the quality and success
of radiotherapy. Further, PSMA is also expressed on the neovasculature of a number of different solid tumors,
so this approach is proof-of-principal for radiation therapy and ablation for other cancers as well."

people worldwide. Glaucoma patients vary widely in their presentation, with some retaining long-term disease
stability, and others progressing quickly to vision loss. If glaucoma patients at highest risk of progression could
be identified early, clinicians could better personalize their treatment approaches. Many clinical factors that
affect glaucoma progression, such as intraocular pressure, treatment history, and medication adherence, are
documented within the free-text notes of the electronic health records (EHR) and are not in large-scale
administrative claims databases. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language
processing (NLP) have enabled the integration of the rich and complex EHR data into highly accurate
predictive algorithms for health outcomes in medicine and surgery. We hypothesize that we can extend these
AI and NLP techniques to build predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression that outperform traditional
models reliant on only administrative features. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive
algorithms for glaucoma progression using large-scale EHR data, while developing Dr Wang's
expertise in AI and NLP, advancing her career as an independent clinician scientist. Aim 1 focuses on
using the structured clinical data within the EHR, which are numeric or coded and readily machine-readable, to
build baseline machine learning models predicting glaucoma progression requiring surgery. Aim 2 focuses on
using and augmenting clinical named entity recognition tools to integrate information from EHR free text into AI
models predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. Aim 3 focuses on understanding, explaining, and
evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in a real-world prospective setting, by evaluating their performance
on key subpopulations, their reliance on key features, and investigating potential areas of bias in a new cohort
of glaucoma patients. This proposal is innovative in developing AI-based predictive algorithms for
glaucoma progression using numeric and textual clinical data uniquely available in the EHR. The tools
and methods Dr Wang will build and evaluate will substantially impact the ophthalmology field by enabling
evidence-based tailoring of treatment approaches to patients' unique clinical characteristics, a step towards
precision medicine. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of AI predictive algorithms on a new cohort of patients
will provide insights into their performance on key subpopulations and reliance on key features, which is critical
to advancing our understanding of possible limitations of deploying AI in the clinical workflow. Dr. Wang's
career and research will advance under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a national
leader in informatics and expert in using NLP on EHR to improve patient care. Her outstanding Advisory
Committee, including clinician-investigators Drs. Pershing, Stein, Chang, and Goldberg, will ensure Dr. Wang's

10808076,"A stroke often damages motor areas of the brain. Understandably, this leads to a loss of movement
control: the limbs become weak, and movements are slower and less well-coordinated. In addition to loss of
function, patients also gain unwanted muscle contractions called synergies. For example, whenever the arm is
lifted (shoulder abduction), the elbow flexes. These co-contractions intrude into normal movements. Synergies,
not just weakness or lack of control, are a major contributor to disability in stroke survivors. Many previous studies
have investigated stroke recovery in animals (typically monkeys because of the close similarities of their motor
system to humans), but these have focused on recovery of lost function, not on synergies. One reason is that in
most previous work monkeys did not express overt synergies; until now we have therefore lacked a model of
one of the major causes of post-stroke disability. This critical gap in our understanding has largely gone
unnoticed. We need to know how to induce synergies in monkeys, which neural circuits are responsible for them,
how they are controlled in health, and how this control becomes disordered after stroke. This project seeks to
address this gap, paving the way for a rational approach to new therapy for synergies.
 In the first experiment, monkeys will be trained on a reaching task, and then implanted with electrodes to
measure muscle activity. High speed video recordings will extract movement kinematics. An instrumented linear
motor will measure tendon-tap reflexes. After baseline recordings, we will induce a focal cortical ischemic lesion,
and gather further data over the subsequent months. We will measure the development of inappropriate
contractions of elbow flexors with shoulder abductors during outward reaches. We will analyze reaching
trajectories to quantify quality of movement (equivalent to a dexterity measure in the hand, but for reach). Tendon
tap reflexes will assess spasticity. Lesions of five different cortical regions will be compared. The lesion which
produces the most severe synergy will then be combined with damage to the magnocellular red nucleus, which
we hypothesize will further accentuate synergy expression. This experiment will elucidate the detailed functional
anatomy of the post-stroke syndrome, and also yield an optimized monkey model of pathological synergies.
 In the second experiment, monkeys will be trained to move an on-screen cursor controlled by shoulder
abduction-elbow flexion torques into targets, allowing parametric examination of independent versus co-
activation. Initially neural circuits will be characterized in healthy monkeys. After necessary surgical implants,
neural activity will be recorded from different parts of the motor cortex, the reticular formation, and the spinal
cord. We hypothesize that spinal circuits will show neural activity consistent with co-activation of shoulder and
elbow muscles to generate synergies; activity in supraspinal areas will be consistent with either driving this spinal
circuit, or suppressing it to allow independent muscle activation. Recordings will then be repeated in monkeys
subjected to the lesion which generates optimal synergies, to reveal the nature of pathological changes."

forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. LC neurons release NE tonically to regulate baseline arousal,
and phasically in the context of a variety of sensory-motor and behavioral functions. However, despite its brain-
wide effects, the conditions under which LC-NE neurons are phasically activated and the modes of NE action
during behavior are poorly understood. One prevailing theory suggests that NE acts to control the gain of output
circuits, thereby modulating task performance by enhancing or dampening responses to stimuli. However,
another theory suggests that NE release in cortical output regions acts to reset network activity, enabling task-
switching or learning of new rules. Neither of these theories adequately explains the many observed roles of the
LC-NE system in learning and behavior. We propose a new hypothesis of LC function, that spatiotemporal
dynamics and modular circuits enable dissociated roles for the LC in behavioral execution and reinforcement
during learned behaviors. Here, we propose to examine multiple features of this hypothesis using innovative
approaches combining optically-tagged recordings of specific neuronal populations, advanced 2-photon imaging
of identified neurons and axons, optogenetic manipulation of LC neurons and subpopulations, and computational
approaches to define encoding of task variables by neurons. In Aim 1, we will record and manipulate the activity
of LC neurons in mice performing an instrumentally conditioned task in which they detect auditory tones of
variable intensity, execute a response, and receive positive or negative reinforcement. Using targeted recordings
from LC-NE neurons as well as newly discovered LC-GABA neurons, we will examine the hypothesis that
subsets of LC-NE and LC-GABA neurons encode task execution signals or reinforcement signals. Using this
information, we will use cell-type specific optogenetics to activate or inhibit LC-NE or LC-GABA neurons during
specific task epochs while measuring the effects on behavior. In Aim 2, we will assess anatomical modularity of
LC projections to motor cortex or the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and examine the hypothesis that neurons with
execution or reinforcement responses project preferentially to motor cortex or PFC. Subsequently, we will
modulate the activity of LC neurons projecting to these targets and measure the effects on execution and
learning. In Aim 3, we will examine the hypothesis that differential integration of NE release in motor cortex and
PFC facilitates task execution and learning, respectively. We will monitor the fast kinetics of NE release in motor
cortex and PFC using a genetically encoded NE sensor, and measure the impact on behavior of silencing NE
activity in these cortical targets using optogenetic silencing of LC-NE axons. These data will provide essential
information for a computationally informed theory of the role of LC in cognition, and provide a mechanistic basis
for understanding the role of LC-NE dysfunction in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders."

Our CEC objective is to facilitate and enhance collaborations that are responsive to community needs, with the
overarching vision and aim of improving community health and public health practice for urban and rural
communities disproportionately impacted by environmental exposures. Our stakeholders include urban and
rural communities, policy-makers, environmental resource managers, and public health professionals. Key
partnerships with community-based organizations, tribes, and educators ground and guide our areas of focus.
We are a robust team with diverse skill sets in research translation and community engagement. In 2019, with
new staff and incoming co-director, we engaged in critical reflection about the effectiveness of our strategies
to-date and the strength of our historic partnerships. We continue to focus on air quality and inhalation-based
exposures, as low-income communities in south Seattle experience disproportionate diesel exposures and
eastern Washington communities face persistent wildfire smoke. Our environmental health programs with
teachers carry our related work on inhalation exposures focus further with lessons on the health impacts of
vaping.
We are poised to deepen and extend our work through impactful projects, research translation and impact
assessment, including through our enhanced focus on disaster research response (DR2). Over the next five
years, we will grow our DR2 areas of work, fostering our community of practice and providing local, statewide,
and national leadership. In addition to ongoing excellence in science communication and research translation,
our CEC will also formalize a Community Responsive Research Lab. With the development of this resource,
we will enhance our ability to connect communities with researchers who can support community-driven
projects. Throughout, we leverage our expertise and EDGE strengths to enhance environmental health literacy

Each year upwards of 14,000 patients are diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant form of
primary brain tumor. Surgical resection followed by radio and chemotherapies are the treatment options for
GBM, but patients generally succumb to the disease. MicroRNAs (miR) are emerging as key regulators of
cellular differentiation and proliferation; have been implicated in the etiology of a variety of cancers, including
GBM. Our exciting preliminary studies show great promise for exosomes shed from induced pluripotent stem
cell derived - neural stem cells (iNSC) expressing miR-124 to target brain tumors. In the mentored (K99)
phase of this study, I will evaluate the immune effects mediated by miR-124 delivered locally into the tumor
bed via encapsulated neural stem cells following tumor debulking. We hypothesize that miR-124 modulation by
exosomes enriched in miR-124 from NSC, when delivered into the tumor resection cavity will target tumor cell
proliferation and enhance T-cell mediated immune clearance of GBM cells. Once these effects are validated, in
the R00 phase of the award, the potential synergy between the modulation of miR-7 and miR-124, which target
AKT and STAT3 respectively will be studied to develop a sECM encapsulated iNSC delivered miR-7/ miR-124
therapeutic approach to target resected GBM. In order to ensure safety of iNSC implantation, the herpes simplex
virus – thymidine kinase suicide gene system will be incorporated. The efficacy of iNSC-miR-7/miR-124/HSV-TK
will be evaluated in mouse models of GBM resection. We hypothesize that dual modulation of miR-124 and miR-
7 will target the AKT-STAT3 signaling that is critical to tumor cell growth and together with the activation of host
immune system medicated tumor clearance will present therapeutic benefit. Upon validation, this microRNA
based therapeutic strategies will pave path to much needed novel treatments to target GBM."
10799706,"Oxidoreductases use metallocofactors, organic molecules and four types of amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan,
cysteine and glycine) to perform electron transfer (ET) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions.
The four amino acids serve as one-electron redox mediators in biocatalytic and multistep electron/hole transfer
(radical transfer) processes some of which are essential to life on earth. There is also a sinister side to amino-
acid ET/PCET since these reactions can be induced at oxidative stress conditions and cause significant cellular
damage. It is extremely challenging to experimentally resolve the thermodynamic and kinetic redox properties
of a single amino-acid residue. The highly oxidizing and reactive nature of amino-acid radicals increases the
barrier for experimental characterization even further. Consequently, key information to support the
understanding of one of nature's essential redox tools is missing. This research project is based on a family of
well-structured model proteins with the unique capability of providing both reversible reduction potentials
(E°'s) and detailed PCET kinetic/mechanistic information on tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W) oxidation-
reduction reactions. The so-called a3X proteins are based on a three-helix bundle (a3) with an aromatic residue
at interior position 32 (X32). The a3X system will be developed along three connected paths to gain novel
information on the fundamental factors that govern Y/W multistep electron/hole transfers. (1) DE°'s and
solution NMR structures obtained on the current a3X family will be analyzed using density functional theory
(DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods. The goal is to obtain a robust
computational protocol for quantitatively predicting DE°'s of Y and W residues. The computational protocol
will be used to identify W analogs with significantly shifted potentials relative to the potential of native W.
Selected analogs will be inserted at site 32 in a3W and their E°'s measured by protein film voltammetry.
Iterative prediction/test cycles will refine and validate the computational protocol. (2) a3 proteins containing
one (a3Y & a3W) and two (a3YX & a3WX, X = Y, W & analogs) redox-active aromatic residues and a tethered
ruthenium (Ru) photosensitizer will be made. These proteins will be used to: (a) Determine the rate of radical
formation in Ru-a3Y and Ru-a3W as a function of the PCET driving force to determine the reorganization
energies associated with the Y32·/Y32 and W32·/W32 redox pairs. This is a fundamental parameter (l) in ET and
PCET rate constant expressions and thus far unknown for protein Y·/Y and W·/W redox pairs. (b) Generate a
comprehensive description of Y/W multistep electron/hole transfers based on rigorously determined structural
(electron donor/acceptor & proton donor/acceptor spatial organization), thermodynamic (DE°' & DpKa), and
kinetic (kPCET & l values) parameters. (3) Advanced NMR and EPR methods will be used to determine the
hydration state of the X32 site in reduced and oxidized a3Y and a3W. Fast sidechain fluctuations essential for
radical formation and infrequent larger-scale fluctuations controlling the radical decay will also be examined."

Training in Infectious Diseases in Peru –
 Time for Implementation Research
PROJECT SUMMARY
 This renewal application proposes to apply the training experience built in Peru over the past 25
years with Fogarty support, and take advantage of the now existing cadre of well-trained clinical
researchers, to guide a new generation of trainees into objective-driven implementation research (IR).
In this five-year period, our trainees will be oriented to produce research aimed to improve policies
and practices in our region. The basic foundations of our program (continuous hands-on participation
in these studies and a step wise system involving a Diploma course in Research Methods, a Master’s
degree in Epidemiology or related fields, advanced courses overseas, and PhD studies), combined
with a wide array of ongoing research programs by our mentors, provide an optimal framework for
this objective. We have succeeded in forming independent researchers, many of whom now head
their own research labs and have obtained competitive grant funding.
 Specifically, we will enroll 50 medium-term mentored post- and pre-graduate students in a
Diploma course (10 per year), 22 mentored Master’s degree students (5 in years 1 to 3, 2 each in
years 4 and 5), and up to four PhD students including two enrolled in the UPCH PhD program. With
the addition of the experienced IR team of the U. of Washington, courses in the foundations and
practice of implementation research will be incorporated into the curricula of the Diploma, master’s
and PhD programs. We will include online versions of these Diplomas and Master´s courses to allow
trainees from less favored regions to enter our research training pathway, and to address changing
norms post SAR-CoV-2.
 We will also establish an implementation unit within the university´s Center for Clinical Studies,
providing trainees with exposure to ongoing clinical studies and allowing the inclusion of IR expertise
at the planning stage of clinical trials, rather than at the end when required information is found not to
have been recorded and translation efforts are many times lost. By the end of every year, our trainees
will submit research proposals with a focus on implementation that will be evaluated by an external
expert panel. The top two will be funded each year. Successful applicants will attend the annual 2-
week Implementation Science Institute at UW. They will also be supported by a mentor with
experience in IR, a thematic mentor, and a prior trainee with more research experience, providing
necessary guidance to perform their proposed study over one year.
 Another addition will be a mentor development track aimed to incorporate up to 24 young mentors,
mostly prior trainees. They will receive training and the appropriate tools to develop their mentoring
skills through interaction with senior mentors, yearly mentorship workshops, online courses, etc., and
will be evaluated in terms of specific deliverables such as thesis advice, research supervision,
publications, and grant submissions from their assigned trainees.
 Focusing on implementation research to improve activities or processes in the health system
should capitalize in this critical mass and provide trainees and mentors a new, productive perspective
while at the same time contribute to a much-needed reduction of inequalities in health.

10775786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Authentic Literacy and Language (ALL) for Science partnership is developing curriculum materials to
authentically engage elementary school students in how scientists use language, while building students’
science knowledge and skills. Building on a previous project with demonstrated results with students in
grades 2-3, ALL for Science is creating four curriculum units for students in grades 4-5 that integrate
standards aligned life science topics, with development of students’ science specific disciplinary
literacies, numeracy and related health content. Science themes for the units focus on areas of low
student performance in life science and reading/writing in Texas.
The project will engage a team of teacher leaders, scientists and educators to develop four Texas
standards- and NGSS- aligned curriculum units, each designed to provide 3–4 weeks of life science
inquiry-based instruction in school or as a blended school and home approach, with aligned
reading/English language arts, health and numeracy. The curriculum units and supporting materials will
be piloted in local classrooms; field tested through well-matched comparison group studies, with random
assignment of groups; and disseminated via the established, high traffic website, BioEd Online
(www.bioedonline.org), and through other pathways to reach state and national audiences with high
quality, free teaching resources. The project directly will impact approximately 285 teachers and 6,840
students, with availability to teachers of more than 800,000 Texas students and national audiences.
The ALL for Science units will be evaluated in urban schools with high enrollments of underrepresented
minority and economically disadvantaged students. In addition, two Houston-area elementary schools
(combined enrollment of more than 1,200 students) will serve as longitudinal implementation sites to
gauge impacts on student achievement and formation of science identity, and teacher practices, while
informing continued project improvement and local dissemination. We will measure changes in teaching
practices and science teaching efficacy beliefs; and will examine growth of students’ content knowledge,
science-specific disciplinary literacies and identity formation as members of a science community.
This project responds to the SEPA program call for innovative curricula that will prepare students in
STEM and enable their teachers to provide instruction using a novel approach. It addresses two of the
three new areas of high programmatic interest: embedded math and reading content and adaptations of
successful SEPA programs with new populations."
10754571,"Comorbid depression is highly prevalent in Veterans with chronic pain and contributes to greater pain
severity, functional impairment, and suicide risk relative to those with chronic pain alone. Despite the well-
known association between chronic pain and depression, current treatments fall short of producing meaningful
improvements in function and quality of life in this population. In this application, we propose to address this
problem by a novel intervention that combines repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
 ACT is an evidence-based psychosocial intervention that improves function in Veterans with chronic
pain. However, similar to the broader literature, comorbid depression significantly limits the efficacy of ACT,
which may be directly related to dysfunctional brain circuits that maintain depression. rTMS is a non-invasive
brain stimulation intervention that is FDA-cleared for the treatment of depression. The most commonly targeted
stimulation area is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), a prefrontal brain region involved in cognitive
control and emotion regulation. rTMS over the left DLPFC has also been used to reduce pain intensity in
patients with chronic pain, as the DLPFC is implicated in the affective processing of painful stimuli. Importantly,
while rTMS has been shown to reduce depression severity and pain intensity, it does not directly address
function. Thus, the proposed research will integrate rTMS and ACT with the goal of maximizing functional
improvement in Veterans with chronic pain and depression.
 The purpose of this application is to examine the feasibility of a future randomized efficacy trial. A total
of 24 Veterans with chronic pain and depression will be randomized into DLPFC-rTMS + ACT or sham-rTMS +
ACT conditions. Multiple metrics of feasibility will be assessed, including general interest in the study,
willingness to participate, enrollment, retention, drop-out, number of adverse events, and participant blindness
to condition, as well as ratings of credibility, expectation, and treatment satisfaction. We will also estimate the
preliminary impact of DLPFC-rTMS + ACT and sham-rTMS + ACT on function as measured by reductions in
pain interference (primary clinical outcome). The intent of preliminary analyses is to obtain an additional
indicator for a future large-scale trial, not to verify group differences. Further, we will include two cognitive
control tasks, the Emotion Distractor and Attention-to-Breath tasks, with concurrent EEG recording as a
potential objective indicator of treatment response. The study team has previously demonstrated the
association between depression severity and DLPFC activity on these tasks. In the proposed study, we will
explore the associations between treatment-related change in DLPFC activity and treatment outcomes.
 Veterans with chronic pain and depression do not have access to effective treatments. To address this
need, we seek to examine the feasibility of a novel approach by integrating a somatic and a psychosocial
intervention. Our scientific premise is that rTMS over the left DLPFC will remediate hypofunction of prefrontal
brain circuits that is necessary to maximize the impact of ACT on function in Veterans with chronic pain and
depression. Findings from the proposed research have the potential of substantially increasing the physical
and psychosocial functioning of Veterans with chronic pain and depression."

of physical and neurological exams and a battery of neurocognitive assessments. In addition to this UDS, 
participants and their study partners complete questionnaires and assessments unique to our ADRC, and 
voluntarily contribute a variety of tissue and biomarker assessments, including genetic analyses, volumetric 
imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and donation of fibroblasts for the generation of induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSC). Overall, 292 of our current 330 active participants have donated fibroblasts or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which have been used to generate 192 iPSC lines by our iPSC Core. Most 
participants agree to brain donation at autopsy and we have a high rate of successful completion of autopsy 
confirmation at death. Our UDS cohort currently includes 330 active participants. Among this cohort, 60% are 
female and one third are non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity. Nineteen percent are demented, 18% meet 
criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and a majority (60%) do not meet diagnostic criteria for MCI or 
dementia. Our overall retention rates are very high and above the median for the ADRC system. Most UDS 
participants have been enrolled in externally funded ancillary studies, ranging from telephone interview studies 
to neuroimaging biomarker research. To support the increasing needs of ADRC investigators, including novel 
studies of molecular and vascular biomarkers, we will grow this UDS cohort to a steady state n=400, with an 
emphasis on enrolling individuals who enable novel studies in support of the UCI ADRC theme “to identify, 
quantify, and validate factors that influence the risk of AD across the lifespan.”!"

10818562,"Project Summary/Abstract
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth is increasingly prevalent in parallel with the obesity epidemic, yet effective
treatment and prevention strategies are limited. The physiologic reduction in insulin sensitivity occurring during
puberty in combination with obesity-related insulin resistance enhance the risk of T2D. Yet it remains unclear
why some youth experience normal pubertal progression with intact β-cell function, while others do not, despite
similar phenotypic and metabolic characteristics. The low incidence and prevalence of T2D in youth compared
to adult’s turns the focus to identifying and characterizing pathophysiological precursors to T2D. More information
is needed regarding the unique events during puberty to better understand the basic pathophysiology of glucose
control, insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and T2D risk in youth, as well as differences by sex/gender and
race/ethnicity, and the potential contribution of harmful environmental factors that are characteristic of this
population. Importantly, this research needs to address the timeline of pathophysiological activity from
normoglycemia to prediabetes to youth-onset T2D (YO-T2D).
The Understanding and Targeting the Pathophysiology of Youth-onset Type 2 Diabetes (UTP-T2D) Consortium
provides a unique opportunity to characterize the risk progression profile and mechanisms underlying the
development of YO-T2D, and evaluate the effects of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Ultimately, the
results of this study will establish a basic pathophysiology to inform future studies aimed at achieving glycemic
control, improving insulin sensitivity, preserving β-cell function, and/or preventing T2D in youth. To address this
goal, the UTP-T2D study will recruit, enroll, and follow a large racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 3,000 at-
risk obese youth in early puberty, extensively phenotype them as they transition through puberty, and
characterize the course of decline and dysfunction in pathophysiological indicators that lead to T2D. The
expected duration of the UTP-T2D study is 5 years, including planning, recruitment, follow-up, analysis, and
reporting. In addition to addressing the aims with analyses conducted as part of the proposed study, the UTP-
T2D consortium will store longitudinal biospecimens and genetic material with the intention of acquiring additional
ancillary funding to pursue analysis of emerging indicators.
The Biostatistics Research Center (BRC) will enhance the value of the UTP-T2D Consortium by 1) overseeing
all operational aspects of the Consortium, 2) providing administrative resources and logical support of the
Consortium, and 3) providing scientific and biostatistical expertise for the Consortium. Through effective
organization, communication, and support, and by promoting a collaborative environment, the BRC will provide
the framework and infrastructure for the Consortium to successfully recruit a cohort of early pubertal youth at
risk for developing prediabetes and T2D, deeply phenotype them through puberty, and ultimately contribute to
a better understanding of the pathophysiology of YO-T2D."
10772016,"Project Summary
 Understanding complex, comorbid conditions of intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) is an NICHD
priority. Severe problem behavior (e.g., self-injurious behavior, aggression) of children with IDD is prevalent,
potentially dangerous, and negatively impacts social integration and quality of life. Function-based differential-
reinforcement-of-alternative-behavior interventions reduce such behavior effectively, but treatment relapse is
common when a caregiver cannot deliver reinforcement for the alternative behavior. Such relapse is known as
resurgence. Previously, we developed a quantitative theory of resurgence based on two well-established
principles: (1) individuals allocate proportionally more responding to options that produce proportionally more
reinforcement, and (2) the value of past reinforcement decays hyperbolically as time passes. The theory
provides a quantitative account of behavior in dynamically changing reinforcement conditions, including when
all reinforcement ceases (i.e., extinction)—the conditions giving rise to resurgence. In Period 1 of this project,
we showed the quantitative accuracy of many of the theory’s predictions with laboratory animals and we have
shown similar relations in resurgence of severe problem behavior of children with IDD in the clinic. However,
the most important and promising finding from Period 1 was one the theory failed to predict. We found that
exposure to a treatment (i.e., contingency discrimination training, CDT) involving alternating sessions in which
alternative reinforcement was and then was not available during continued extinction of a target response
substantially mitigated resurgence. To account for these effects, we have developed a refined version of the
quantitative theory suggesting that individuals exposed to CDT rapidly learn to discriminate the continued
unavailability of reinforcement for the target behavior, even when reinforcement is not available for the
alternative response, thus serving to inoculating them against later resurgence. These findings and the refined
quantitative theory from Period 1 suggest promising, innovative, and unexplored procedures for treating severe
problem behavior that are likely to produce better resurgence mitigation than existing approaches, while also
avoiding some downsides of the current methods to mitigate resurgence of problem behavior (i.e., arbitrary
stimuli that caregivers may lose or use incorrectly). Period 2 of this project will focus on this highly innovative
approach identified in Period 1 in two aims by conducting: (1) the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the
resurgence-mitigating effects of CDT on severe problem behavior of children with IDD and (2) a series of
experiments with laboratory animals testing the refined theory under a range of conditions predicted to improve
the efficacy, efficiency, and practicality of CDT in future clinical applications. This project represents a close
collaboration between basic and clinical scientists with a demonstrated ability to use basic quantitative
theoretical and empirical research to improve clinical practice to prevent relapse of severe problem behavior,
and thus, to reduce its devastating impact on children and their families."
10817041,"ABSTRACT
In the United States, overdose is the leading cause of adult deaths with more than 136 Americans dying from
overdosing on opioids every day. Medical cannabis has been approved in many states as a treatment for pain
disorders and as a potential substitute for prescription opioids, in what is considered by many to be a
controversial policy. While state-level aggregate data suggests that states with medical cannabis laws have
lower rates of prescription opioid and benzodiazepine use, these results may be confounded by the fact that
policies aimed at curbing the opioid epidemic occurred concurrently with medical cannabis legislation in many
states. The effects of medical cannabis alone can be isolated using longitudinal, patient-level data. Adults aged
≥50 represent a vulnerable group with highest rates of prescription opioid and benzodiazepine use. They are the
largest consumers of prescription medications, and are three times more likely to be prescribed opioids and
benzodiazepines to alleviate pain, sleep disorders/insomnia, and anxiety. This group also has multiple medical
comorbidities and are hence more susceptible to the detrimental effects of medical cannabis, with prescription
drug use patterns being especially problematic among women as they are prescribed these drugs more often,
consume them in larger quantities, and use them for longer periods of time.
 Relevant to NOSI: NOT-DA-20-014, the proposed project will characterize the relationship between medical
cannabis use, concomitant prescription opioid and benzodiazepine use, and subsequent health outcomes in the
Yale-New Haven Healthcare System (YNHHS) in Connecticut. This system covers a population of approximately
1.5 million, with approximately 750,000 patients seen annually. This will be accomplished by innovative linkage
between YNHHS's electronic healthcare records and Connecticut's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program,
which, uniquely, includes medical cannabis products, and other statewide census data.
Specific Aim 1: To characterize the longitudinal association between medical cannabis use and change
in concomitant use of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines. By examining patient-level, longitudinal
data (using propensity-score methods), we will clarify the strength of the association, the direction of the
association, and the temporal relationship of the association.
Specific Aim 2: To determine the association between medical cannabis prescription and healthcare
utilization/medical outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, treatment services utilization, overdose) among
adults aged ≥50 using patient-level data in the Yale-New Haven Health catchment area. We will investigate
association between medical cannabis prescription and all-cause mortality, new-onset drug overdose,
emergency department visits, and hospitalization."

10805363,"ABSTRACT – TRD1: Virtual Patients
The broad objective of the Center for Virtual Imaging Trials is to develop and provide a comprehensive virtual
platform for assessment of a medical imaging technology or clinical application from design to use, initially in
Computed Tomography (CT). Virtual imaging trials, consisting of computerized patients, scanner models, and
image analysis methods, provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized
use of emerging medical imaging technologies and approaches. Experiments can be conducted quickly and
cost effectively on a computer with known ground truth (exact patient anatomy and physiological conditions
are known) and with complete user control of the virtual imaging device and protocol. With the growing use of
CT, the need for such a toolset is at an all-time high to optimize image quality versus dose, personalizing
technologies to the characteristics of individual patients.
Virtual imaging trials require a realistic virtual patient population. The team previously developed a series of
60 adult and 90 pediatric 4D whole-body computational human models known as XCAT phantoms (extended
cardiac-torso). The phantoms have found wide use in numerous research projects both in the team's
laboratory and by others, but they are limited in that they do not cover the full range of patient anatomies
indicative of the population at large, including pregnancy, and lack sufficient realism in terms of anatomical
textures, motion, blood flow, and contrast perfusion. All of these factors are significant determinants of image
quality as well as absorbed radiation dose.
This work of TRD1 will greatly expand the coverage of the XCAT library, creating a population of whole-body
4D phantoms to represent combinations of sex, age, race, height, and weight including anatomically variable
models for stages of pregnancy. Further, TRD1 will update the XCAT motion models, incorporate blood flow
to simulate intra-organ contrast perfusion within vital organs, and develop additional models for the tissue
heterogeneity within the body including disease-related abnormalities. Such innovations greatly enhance the
realism of the phantoms, giving researchers the ability to generate patient-quality CT data in order to assess
image quality as well as dose in the presence of motion and contrast. The tools will be packaged into a
framework from which researchers will be able to generate virtual populations, on demand, morphing between
the templates to create 1000s of realistic phantoms with user-defined anatomical characteristics, lesions,
physiologic motion, and contrast.
The framework to produce realistic, vast populations of customizable virtual subjects will be combined with the
Center's virtual scanners (TRD2) and virtual readers (TRD3) components. Through these advances, the
proposed Center will have a significant impact on the development, evaluation, and optimization of clinically
informed 3D and 4D CT imaging technologies with potential future expansion to other modalities."

technologies with human subjects. With the trial taking place in silico, virtual trials require a fast and realistic
CT simulator. However, current CT simulators are inadequate to meet this need due to limited representation
of the actual CT acquisition processes and slow speed. Simulators using Monte Carlo methods are optimal in
accurately modeling the image acquisition process but too slow for simulating high resolution images.
Alternative ray-tracing methods are faster but unable to provide realistic estimates of absorbed radiation dose,
a factor of high importance in CT imaging. Most simulators are further limited in their ability to model specific
CT makes and models, which would be essential to represent an actual clinical CT imaging scenario.
This project develops and provides a new CT simulation platform to meet the desired throughput and realism
of virtual imaging trials. The platform combines the benefits of high spatio/temporal details (provided by ray-
tracing), precise radiation dose and scatter estimates (provided by Monte Carlo), speed (provided by GPU
computing and proficient programing), and specificity (modeling CT subcomponents based on precise system
specifications from CT manufacturers). Already prototyped for one CT scanner, this project will expand the
prototype into a comprehensive CT simulator platform for multiple CT systems.
The Specific Aims of the project are (1) to model CT acquisition subcomponents in detail; (2) to model CT
acquisition schemes for estimating primary signal, scatter, and radiation dose; (3) to implement processes for
integration, image formation, and validation; and (4) to build a modular interface to enable effective use of the
simulator. The simulation will include manufacturer-specific, user-defined, and generic (i.e., manufacturer-
neutral) CT systems and reconstruction algorithms, detector geometry and models (including photon-counting
detectors), full user-control over acquisition specifications (i.e., virtual patient input from TRD1, CT scanner,
protocol, kV, mA, recon, etc.), and a user-friendly modular interface with both GUI and script-based utility.
This work will provide a first-of-its-kind rapid and accurate CT simulator with scanner-specific, user-
customizable, and generic 3D and 4D modeling capabilities, which can simulate both reconstructed images
and absorbed radiation dose. Users will be able to utilize the simulator to study a variety of CT technologies
and applications, such as those pertaining to radiation dose optimization, image quality assessment, and
image deformation from cardiac and respiratory motion. The simulator would enable task-based design and
evaluation of new CT systems and artificial intelligence (AI)-based training through generating large-scale
realistic image datasets that replicate the realism of clinical images with the added advantage of known ground
truth. The CT simulation platform, combined with the suite of virtual patients (TRD1) and virtual readers (TRD3)
offered by the Center, form the essential toolset to enable virtual imaging trials in CT."
10805368,"ABSTRACT – TRD3: Virtual Readers
The Center proposes virtual imaging trials (VITs), a new paradigm to evaluate rapidly advancing imaging
technologies, including computed tomography (CT). VITs offer a computational alternative to the evaluation of
these technologies through clinical trials, which are slow, expensive, and often lack ground truth, while
exposing subjects to ionizing radiation. The Center will develop a VIT platform to emulate key elements of the
imaging chain from virtual patients (TRD1) to virtual scanners (TRD2) to virtual readers (TRD3). The virtual
reader, the focus of this TRD, are defined as image analysis tools that emulate and extend the clinical reading
of images for specific tasks or needs such as lesion detection, classification, or measurement. Specifically, the
virtual readers comprise three representative categories: observer models, radiomics, and machine learning.
Virtual readers can efficiently and effectively analyze the vast amounts of data in imaging trials, be they clinical
or simulated. To date, most virtual reader approaches have been limited by their narrow focus, uncertainty of
ground truth (normal anatomy and disease), or lack of interoperability. As a result, these technologies have not
yet been translated broadly. To address this unmet need, TRD3 will codify a suite of easy-to-use virtual reader
tools to enable not only VITs but also a wide range of other medical image evaluation needs.
This work will proceed in three Specific Aims: (1) implement an observer model and radiomics toolset for task-
based assessment of CT images, (2) create deep learning resources for analysis and processing of CT
images, and (3) integrate virtual reader utilities into a unified VIT platform and validate it against studies with
real images and radiologists. While TRD3 focuses primarily on virtual readers, as the final technology
development project of the Center, it will also validate Center resources as a whole.
The deliverables of TRD3 include the following: (1) virtual reader tools that go beyond niche applications and
generalize to different subjects, systems, and tasks; (2) performance assessment that is informed by
controllable ground truth for both normal anatomy and disease; (3) “estimability index” to assess bias and
precision of virtual reader metrics; (4) machine learning tools that perform disease detection and classification
as well as data augmentation, all of which are crucial to VITs; (5) resources for medical imaging that transcend
VITs with applications including clinical evaluation and education, and (6) benchmark databases and
performance levels that facilitate a culture of open science where technology assessment becomes fair and
reproducible. TRD3 will have a significant impact on clinical imaging science and practice by not only enabling
effective ways of evaluating imaging technology but also spurring new developments in data science for
medical imaging. The virtual reader resources combined with myriad clinical and simulated image data of the
Center will provide the essential framework to enable VITs in CT imaging and beyond."
10805369,"ABSTRACT – Technology Training and Dissemination (TTD)
Technology Training and Dissemination (TTD) is an essential part of the Center’s resources, necessary to
facilitate the use of our existing and new technology and software by scientists outside the Center. The goals
of the TTD component are to educate and train researchers to utilize the Center’s resources in their own
research and to disseminate the Center’s virtual imaging tools and resources to the scientific community. To
accomplish these goals, the TTD will implement training and dissemination approaches that meet the diverse
needs of a broad biomedical community, including both novice and specialist users. These approaches will
ensure that a growing community of researchers can effectively use the Center’s resources in their work and
provide feedback that will benefit the Center’s activities. The training plan comprises in-person training through
on-site and off-site workshops, on-site residencies, and ongoing interactions through seminars and scientific
forums. The dissemination plan comprises resources to access the Center’s virtual imaging trial (VIT) tools,
access documentation (user manuals, video guides), obtain support for running and execution, and access
sample code with preconfigured datasets and subcomponents of the VIT tools. Subcomponents include the 3D
and 4D patient models (“virtual patients”) from TRD1, the CT simulation programs (“virtual scanners”) from
TRD2, and the machine learning and task-based analysis tools (“virtual readers”) from TRD3. Software
integration and development will be supported by the Duke Health Technology Solutions (DHTS) office and
managed by two full-time software personnel. The training and dissemination components will be made
available through a website, developed and managed by the Center, which will outline the technological and
educational resources available to the community and information on how to access them. The website will
also be used to collect feedback on existing tools and new desired upgrades from users, which will constantly
help the Center improve its offerings. The research team will leverage its strong ties with other Duke
departments and its rich track record of training and technology dissemination to provide a robust and
comprehensive TTD component to advance the Center’s mission."

Most cellular functions are carried out by multisubunit protein complexes. Transcribe and translate as much as
you want, but odds are if your protein doesn’t assemble properly with other proteins, the gene might as well be
off. As the final step in expression of most genes, protein complex assembly is hugely understudied, and it has
only recently become clear that the textbook model of diffusion-limited collisions between individual molecules
is inadequate. Septin proteins are found as cytoskeletal filaments in many eukaryotic cells and participate in a
wide variety of cellular functions. The building blocks of septin filaments are rod-shaped septin complexes
composed of distinct septin subunits. Multiple septins “compete” to occupy the same position in, and confer
specialized properties to, septin complexes, but it is not fully understood how specific subunits are “chosen” to
assemble the functionally appropriate complexes. How individual septins occupy specific positions within
complexes is one of the oldest questions in septin biology. Disease-causing septin mutations highlight the
importance of answering this question. Our lab is among the leaders in this field and in the next five years we
want to use the powerful tools we have developed in budding yeast to address specific knowledge gaps. For
other cytoskeletal proteins, achieving the conformation competent for complex assembly requires help from
molecular chaperones. How does chaperone-assisted de novo septin folding fit into the pathway of septin
complex assembly? Our recent work established the step-wise pathway of septin hetero-octamer assembly, and
identified septin-interacting chaperones that engage a septin-septin interaction interface and are necessary for
efficient septin folding. We will use a combination of genetics, cell biology and biochemistry to determine how
chaperone action sets the stage for septin-septin encounters during complex assembly. Recent studies show
that assembly of many complexes occurs co-translationally, and we find chaperone requirements for efficient
septin translation. To what extent is septin complex assembly co-translational? We will investigate septin-
chaperone and septin-septin interactions in the context of active translation. We previously identified key
residues in septin-septin interaction interfaces that mediate “partner recognition” during assembly and dictate
the subunit composition within complexes. An enduring mystery is how the two subunits at the “ends” of yeast
septin hetero-octamers always match. How do allosteric conformational changes across septin-septin interaction
interfaces direct the specificity of septin complex subunit composition? We will determine the mechanistic basis
of this phenomenon and determine the phenotypic consequences of inappropriate “mixing” of septin subunits
within complexes. Finally, it is not known how, once made, a septin complex is remodeled to incorporate new
subunits during cellular differentiation. We will determine the molecular mechanism by which yeast septin
complexes are remodeling during gametogenesis. These studies will provide valuable insights into how cells
assemble and modify septin complexes, with broader implications for multisubunit assembly in general."

 Chronic sleep disturbance is a frequent and challenging problem of human aging. In the US an
estimated 39.6 million people including 8.5 million Veterans are aged 65 or older and at risk of developing
chronic sleep disturbance. Chronic insufficient or disrupted sleep is associated with multiple adverse health
outcomes, including increased risk of fall, cognitive decline, anxiety, depressive disorders, and Alzheimer's
disease. Also, elderly Veterans have a high prevalence of medical and psychiatric disorders that can further
aggravate sleep disturbance.
 Recently, we found that chronic suppression of hypothalamic cell proliferation in young mice
produced sleep-wake features of aging including sleep disruption and poor response to sleep loss. Here,
we proposes a series of novel preclinical studies that will use complimentary and cutting edge approaches
to examine: a) if hypothalamic neurogenesis regulates sleep function by maintaining a supply of new cells to
replace senescent sleep-regulatory ventrolateral preoptic area galanin (VLPOGAL) and GABA (VLPOGABA)
neurons; b) if a disruption of hypothalamic neurogenesis, caused by chronic inflammation that accompanies
aging, contributes to physiological dysfunction and or loss of the critical sleep-regulatory VLPOGAL and
VLPOGABA neurons and consequent sleep disturbance in aging; and c) if sleep disturbance in aging could be
mitigated by neuro-regenerative and anti-inflammatory approaches.
Specific aim-1: will determine if hypothalamic neurogenesis is vital for maintaining the functioning of the
VLPO sleep regulatory neuronal groups and that its impairment is a driver of their functional decline and
sleep disruption in aging. We will determine the extent of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation of
precursor cells into sleep regulatory VLPOGAL and VLPOGABA neurons and their sleep-associated activation
in young and old mice, and in young mice after chronic suppression of neurogenesis (experiment-1). We
predict that old mice or mice with impaired hypothalamic neurogenesis will exhibit: a) a decline in cell
proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells into VLPOGAL and VLPOGABA neurons, b) fewer VLPOGAL
and VLPOGABA neurons exhibiting seep-associated Fos-immunoreactivity; and c) more sleep disruption. We
will use calcium imaging to determine if VLPOGAL neurons exhibit a functional decline, paralleling the deficits
in spontaneous and impaired homeostatic sleep responses in aging (experiment-2). We will use
chemogenetic activation to determine the ability of VLPOGAL neurons to promote sleep after disrupting
neurogenesis, a low grade inflammation, and after disrupting neurogenesis in the presence of a neurogenic
factor to determine if a decline in the ability of VLPOGAL neurons to promote sleep after chronic suppression
of hypothalamic neurogenesis is attenuated by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).
Specific aim-2: will determine if increasing hypothalamic cell proliferation and neurogenesis of VLPO sleep
regulatory neurons improves sleep architecture and sleep continuity in old mice. We will determine if in
aged mice, sustained induction of hypothalamic cell proliferation by ICV infusion of CNTF, a neurogenic
factor with a protective role against neuroinflammatory pathologies, increases migration and differentiation
of neurites into mature VLPOGAL neurons; decreases neuroinflammation and senescence; and reduces
sleep fragmentation (experiment-4). We will use chemogenetic activation to determine if the ability of
VLPOGAL neurons to promote sleep improves after CNTF treatment in old mice (experiment-5).
 The data obtained from these preclinical studies would provide insights into the mechanisms
underlying sleep disruption in aging. Our studies also include pharmacological elements that could provide
therapeutic options for optimizing sleep health in the elderly including elderly Veterans"

Thus, there is a strong and urgent need for an effective and widely applicable therapy.
Excessive accumulation of lipids in beta cells is considered to contribute to the development of T2D.
Experimental data supports that lipid overload activates multiple stress pathways including inflammation, ER
stress, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction ultimately leading to the loss of functional beta cell
mass. We have found evidence that the accumulation of triglycerides (TG) in human islets from T2D donors is
associated with dysregulation of lipolysis, a previously unrecognized defect in T2D islets that accelerates TG
accumulation in T2D islets. Glucose activates lipolysis in non-diabetic human islets but not in T2D islets.
Furthermore, our preliminary data indicates that the dysregulation of lipolysis impairs insulin secretion by
reducing the stability of syntaxin1a (Stx1a), one of the SNARE complex proteins important for exocytosis.
When we tested the impact of dysregulation of lipolysis using human pseudoislets in which the expression of
the principal TG lipase (ATGL) is down-regulated, ATGL deficient human pseudoislets showed excessive lipid
droplet (LD) accumulation and impaired insulin secretion along with proteasomal degradation of Stx1a.
Importantly, the reduction of Stx1a is a defect reported in human T2D islets. Thus, we hypothesize that the
dysregulation of lipolysis in response to glucose reduces the stability of Stx1a and impairs insulin secretion in
T2D islets. To understand molecular mechanism behind the defects in T2D islets, it will be imperative to
determine how glucose upregulates lipolysis in beta cells, why glucose fails to upregulate lipolysis in T2D
islets, and how the impairment in lipolysis reduces Stx1a. We will approach our questions using human
pseudoislets and INS1 cells as models since they exhibit similarity with human islets in LD formation, the
regulation of lipolysis, and phenotypes of ATGL deficiency. We expect to obtain novel information regarding
how dysregulation of lipid mobilization causes beta cell dysfunction in T2D through the following aims.
Specific aim 1: Determine a mechanism by which ATGL increases lipolysis in response to glucose in
non-diabetic beta cells
We will systematically test potential targets by which glucose increases lipolysis in INS1 cells and non-diabetic
human beta cells. Aim 1a will test which glucose generated signals regulates lipolysis in beta cells. Aim 1b-d
will test whether glucose increases lipolysis by modifying ATGL, co-lipases, or perilipins.
Specific aim 2: Determine a mechanism by which lipolysis is dysregulated in type 2 diabetic beta cells
Aim 1 dissects a mechanism by which glucose regulates lipolysis in beta cells. Leveraging on the information
from Aim 1, we will determine why T2D islets are unable to increase lipolysis in response to glucose and how
we can restore lipolysis in T2D islets.
Specific Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that defective lipolysis destabilizes stx1a in T2D islets
Stx1a is proposed to contribute to the impairment of insulin secretion in T2D as Stx1a is reduced in islets of
T2D models and human islets affected by T2D. However, it has been unknown why Stx1a is reduced in T2D
islets. Our preliminary data implicates that the impairment of lipolysis may cause the reduction of Stx1a in T2D
islets. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that reduced lipolysis contributes to the reduction of Stx1a in T2D islets
through accelerating degradation of Stx1a due to reduced palmitoylation.
Our study combines pharmacological and molecular approaches to increase our understanding of the
pathogenesis of beta cell dysfunction in T2D. The information obtained will potentially lead us to a novel target
that improves beta cell function in T2D by restoring LD mobilization in beta cells."

Advance directive (AD) completion is associated with improved quality of end-of-life (EOL) care, reduced use
of aggressive and costly medical treatments, lower likelihood of in-hospital deaths, and lessened decisional
burden of healthcare surrogates. Older Chinese Americans, despite being the fastest growing and the second
largest immigrant population in the United States, have significantly lower AD completion rate (10%-14%) than
the general older American population (37%-60%). Although a few studies have examined demographic and
cultural factors of AD completion among older Chinese Americans, death attitude, a modifiable and culturally
salient factor, has been overlooked. Death attitude closely intersects with many aspects of Chinese culture,
such as filial piety, centrality of the family, familial hierarchy, and religion. Furthermore, Chinese Americans
believe that discussing death brings bad luck and therefore they tend to avoid topics related to death in
conversation, which greatly hinders advance care planning and negatively affects the well-being of older
Chinese Americans and their family members. To address this knowledge gap, this project will use an
explanatory sequential mixed-methods design and focus on the following specific aims: (Aim 1) identify factors,
i.e., demographic, social, and structural factors, that are associated with older Chinese Americans’ death
attitude; (Aim 2) examine the association between death attitude and attitude toward AD and AD completion
among older Chinese Americans; and (Aim 3) evaluate how and in what ways any significant factors identified
in Aim 2 influence older Chinese Americans’ AD completion and attitude toward AD through focus groups.
Informed by the Andersen’s Health Service Utilization Model, we will collect and analyze quantitative survey
data to address Aims 1 and 2. Then, informed by the Transtheoretical Model for Behavioral Change, we will
collect and analyze qualitative data from focus groups to address Aim 3. Findings will inform future research
on developing, evaluating, and implementing culturally responsive interventions that improve advance care
planning and AD completion and fill critical gaps in research specifically to the advance care planning needs
among older Chinese Americans."

Natural Killer (NK) cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC) type I (ILC1) are key effectors in host defense against
skin-borne viruses and in cutaneous anti-tumor responses; they also modulate inflammatory skin diseases.
Despite their critical role, little is known about the migratory patterns of skin-homing NK cells and ILC1, their
organ selectivity or functions, and whether they can be selectively targeted. In contrast, organ-selective homing
to skin and intestines of T cell subsets is harnessed for vaccine strategies and in the treatment of organ-specific
autoimmunity. This exploratory proposal is based on the overall hypothesis that there is a distinct population of
skin-homing NK cells and ILC1 that is is key to cutaneous host defense. To study skin-trafficking of NK cells and
ILC1, we propose to revisit the classic model of afferent lymph cannulation in the sheep, which allows to collect
NK cells during their physiological recirculation through skin. By targeted analysis of skin-recirculating lymph-
borne NK cells, we will assess expression of canonical skin-homing receptors and effector molecules. In addition,
we will use Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE Seq) to determine gene
expression profiles of skin-recirculating NK and ILC1 cells and assess overlap with NK cells in control sites
(intestinal lymph and blood). These studies will be complemented by genetic mouse models and viral skin
infection mouse models utilizing the poxviruses vaccinia virus (VACV) and ectromelia virus (ECTV). Our
preliminary studies discovered that skin-recirculating NK cells express high levels of α4β1-integrin, whose ligand
VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed by skin vasculature. Therefore, we will test the role of α4β1-integrin in NK
cell skin homing and relevance for resistance to skin-borne VACV and ECTV. This will also establish a pipeline
to test the significance of additional molecules expressed by skin-recirculating NK cell in future studies. In
summary, the proposed studies will greatly enhance our understanding of skin-homing NK cells and ILC1, and
our ability to manipulate skin-specific immune responses in cutaneous pathologies ranging from infection and
cancer to inflammation."

Breast cancer survivors experience steep and rapid declines in physical function within 3 to 12 months after
cancer treatment. Cancer treatment impairs cardiovascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems. Normally,
these physiologic systems work in concert to enable physical function, and when one system is compromised,
other systems compensate. However, when multiple physiologic systems are simultaneously compromised,
patients develop impairments in physical function. Breast cancer survivors experience physical functional
impairments at an earlier age and 2- to 4-fold more frequently than age-matched persons without cancer. In
women over 65, functional decline may have far greater consequences than in younger adults; functional decline
in older adults is linked to a loss of independence, disability, and death. No approved mitigating therapies are in
place to treat or prevent functional decline. We hypothesize that cancer treatment-related functional decline can
be alleviated by targeting fundamental aging processes, such as cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is a
state of terminal growth arrest. Senescence results from both natural aging and chemotherapy. Senescent cells
(Sncs) secrete proinflammatory factors (senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP) that cause tissue
damage and age-related dysfunction. In mouse models, Sncs/SASP can be reduced by agents that selectively
eliminate Sncs (senolytics). Senolytics alleviate frailty in mice and show promise in humans in multiple ongoing
trials; senolytics reduce Snc burden in human fat tissue, decrease inflammation in older patients with diabetes,
and reduce frailty in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. However, the ability of senolytics to reduce Sncs/SASP
and, ultimately, improve physical function in older breast cancer survivors has not been tested. Our preliminary
data provide evidence that older breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy (vs. no chemotherapy) have
a higher systemic Snc burden (circulating Sncs/SASP markers) and that physical function and systemic Snc
burden are linked. We hypothesize that targeting Sncs with senolytics will improve physical function and reduce
systemic Snc burden in chemotherapy-treated older breast cancer survivors. We will test this hypothesis in a
double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of senolytic therapy vs. placebo in older (age >65) breast
cancer survivors (n=44) who are 3 to 12 months post-chemotherapy completion and have diminished gait speed.
Our specific aims are to determine the effects of senolytic therapy (vs. placebo) on physical function (Aim 1) and
systemic Snc burden (Aim 2). This study will provide preliminary evidence for a large multi-center trial to establish
the efficacy of senolytics in frail older breast cancer survivors. If successful, this would fill a crucial clinical need,
as these women currently have no pharmacological options for the treatment or prevention of chemotherapy-
induced functional decline. Moreover, since senescence underlies many of the mid and late-life chronic diseases,
a safe senolytic that improves function would have a major positive impact that will extend far beyond oncology."

Large effect mutations in innate immunity genes can have dramatic effects on infectious disease susceptibility
and outcome. In addition, the genetic determinants of more subtle and widespread variation in an individual’s
susceptibility and immune response to viral infections has been studied in the context of mutations in the many
known innate immunity genes. We propose that there are new polymorphic innate immune genes created by
retroviruses (so called ‘retrocopies’) in the genome of many individuals which are typically overlooked, and which
have the capacity to modulate an individual’s immune response. Thousands of young and old retrocopies are
present in each human genome and their number and sequences differ among individuals in a population. Until
now, old retrocopies have largely been ignored as pseudogenes, while young retrocopies have been
understudied due to technical challenges of accurate identification inherent in the most common sequencing
technologies. A pioneering study in our lab showed that human and other primate genomes contain retrocopies
of the APOBEC3 family of viral restriction factors that are transcribed and capable of restricting virus replication
in vitro. Our more recent preliminary data revealed extensive retrocopying of additional antiviral gene families
within humans and other primate species, suggesting the recent retrocopying of viral restriction and host
dependency factors may be widespread. Further, some of these retrocopies are very young – present in only
some humans – and could represent an unappreciated source of individual variation in susceptibility or
resistance to viral infection. With a combination of computational biology, in vitro virology and biochemistry, and
high throughput functional assays, we will identify young retrocopies of virus-interacting genes that are present
in only some humans and test these new genes’ ability to enhance or impede the innate immune system’s
antiviral response. To test our hypothesis that retrocopy expansions modify immune system function, we will: (1)
Identify young, polymorphic retrocopies of host dependency and restriction factor genes in humans. (2)
Characterize transcription and antiviral functions of polymorphic host dependency and restriction factor
retrocopies, either as restriction factors or dependency factors that evade viral co-option. (3) Identify retrocopies
that act as dominant negative inhibitors of their parental antiviral genes thereby inhibiting the innate immune
system and promoting viral replication. This research will discover new innate immune genes and found a new
direction in understanding the genetic determinants of an individual's susceptibility and immune response to
virus infection."

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heterogeneous brain disorder typically characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and
functional decline, with a typical first onset in late adolescence and early adulthood. Genetic, neuropathological,
and neuroimaging studies have suggested a role of neuroinflammation in the etiology of SCZ, which is evident
early in the course of illness. This suggests neuroinflammation may represent a SCZ risk marker and therefore
facilitate early recognition and future drug development to improve outcomes. In vivo imaging methods for
estimating neuroinflammation have been limited by radiation exposure, specificity, and cost. Our proposal aims
to validate a novel non-invasive, new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called Diffusion Basis
Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) to identify neuroinflammation in SCZ. DBSI can simultaneously detect and quantify
neuroinflammation (increased cellularity) and white matter alterations (axonal injury/loss and demyelination) and
has been previously validated in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, but not in SCZ. We propose to test
the overarching hypothesis that DBSI will identify neuroinflammation in histological samples from SCZ patients.
To achieve this objective, we will obtain postmortem brain samples of 18–30-year-old SCZ patients and matched
controls (n=20) from the NIH Neurobiobank and investigate the relationship of the DBSI cellularity subcomponent
with tissue reactivity for the microglial marker, CD163, and the complement marker, C4 (Aim 1). We hypothesize
a strong linear relationship between DBSI cellularity and selected gray and white matter regions. In addition, we
will use DBSI in vivo to characterize the brains of 18–30-year-old SCZ patients and controls (n=30) and identify
group differences in DBSI subcomponents (Aim 2). We hypothesize greater DBSI cellularity in SCZ brains
compared to controls. In completing this work, we expect to identify non-invasive neuroinflammation and white
matter integrity markers for SCZ. In the long term, this information would be used to improve the identification of
those at risk for developing psychosis and facilitate the testing of new treatments."

Down Syndrome (DS) is caused by triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), resulting in
intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and early onset Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The
mechanistic connection between triplicated genes in DS and the all-encompassing imbalance in
gene expression underlying the abnormalities seen in DS brain cells has not been established. It
is also unknown how this global transcriptomic disbalance leads to intellectual disability and early
development of AD-related pathology in DS, nor what genes play a key role in these processes.
 In our preliminary studies, we generated oligocortical spheroids (OLS) derived from DS
isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) lines. Trisomic OLS recapitulate DS and AD-
related cellular phenotypes, including reduced cortical volume, aberrant myelination and
pathological depositions of amyloid beta and hyper-phosphorylated tau. Through our single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of euploid and trisomic OLS, we identified a cluster of X-
linked genes containing brain expressed X-linked/transcription elongation factor A (SII)
(BEX/TCEAL) family members, that is downregulated in trisomy. At the same time, trisomic cells
showed a significantly increased expression of non-coding X-inactive specific transcript (XIST),
responsible for the X-chromosome inactivation. Importantly, the dysregulation of BEX/TCEAL is
linked to psychiatric disorders, intellectual deficits, neurodegeneration, and AD. Noticeably, other
recent studies, including those performed in DS cell lines and human postmortem brains, showed
downregulated expression of different genes in this cluster accompanied by enhanced XIST
levels. However, the aberrant expression of these transcription factors and their potential
connection to brain pathology in trisomy has been neglected. Herein, we hypothesize that
downregulation of BEX/TCEAL is causatively related to abnormal brain development and
AD pathology in DS. In our studies, we will determine the contribution of X-chromosome-linked
genes’ repression to DS-related pathology by assessing whether reducing XIST or restoring
BEX/TCEAL gene expression can mitigate DS-associated cellular phenotypes. We will
specifically focus on the effect of BEX2 and TCEAL7 downregulation in DS since their expression
was most consistently downregulated across multiple developmental periods in DS human
transcriptomic study, further supporting our preliminary data. We will also define the genome-wide
downstream targets of BEX2 and TCEAL7 and their significance in trisomy. Our translational,
human-directed study will ultimately test the causative link between the dysregulation of X-
chromosome-linked genes’, and transcriptional and phenotypical alterations in trisomy."

Glycans play essential roles in virtually all aspects of biology. Thus, they have broad applications, including
supplementation of necessary human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) to infant formula as therapeutics to prevent
infection by multiple pathogens, maintain proper microbiota, prevent allergies, and treat necrotizing enterocolitis
in infants. However, present synthesis methods for the more complex HMOs fail in affordable scalability that
hinders their development as glycan therapeutics. Although current one-pot multienzyme (OPME) systems for
HMO synthesis have streamlined numerous synthetic reaction steps, little has been done on optimization and
scalability. We hypothesize that a modular OPME system for glycan synthesis can be optimized and integrated
with inexpensive polyphosphate-based energy regeneration to decrease cost and significantly increase yield of
desirable glycans. In Aim 1, we will establish reference OPME reactions for single sugar transfer steps that start
from simple building blocks of monosaccharides and glycan acceptors as input, and provide enzymes for high-
energy sugar donor synthesis, monosaccharide transfer and energy regeneration. These studies will develop
scalable modules for optimization of chemical input (donor and acceptor building blocks, catalytic quantities of
nucleotides, divalent cations, controlled pH, and enzyme catalysts) to establish cross-platform compatible
reaction conditions. In Aim 2, we will establish a scalable, coupled polyphosphate energy regeneration system
for OPME glycan synthesis. Optimization of polyphosphate as an energy source will require control of
polyphosphate and divalent cation concentrations, neutralization of pH changes, and integration of enzymes that
generate ATP (RpPPK2-3) and distribute high-energy phosphate equivalents to other nucleotide forms (NDK).
Our goals are to create a universal energy source that integrates the continual synthesis of UDP-, GDP-, CMP-,
and ADP-sugar donors in large-scale OPME reactions. In Aim 3, we will generate proof-of-concept scalable
OPME synthesis of model HMO targets of biological interest for optimization. The approach will combine
synthetic modules for sugar donor synthesis and glycan extension with optimized energy regeneration and
determine conditions for cross-platform compatibility for all enzymatic steps in the energy-coupled OPME
(ecOPME) platform. The HMO targets also provide opportunities to test combined ecOPME reactions as well as
sequential ecOPME sugar additions where enzyme competition would yield undesired products. The goals are
to integrate multiple enzymatic transfer steps through the selective use of glycosyltransferase acceptor specificity
coupled with energy regeneration to result in a proof-of-concept modular platform for efficient, flexible, and
scalable synthesis of target therapeutic HMOs starting from simple monosaccharide building blocks."

Prior studies have reported that the Medicare program does not result in significant declines of mortality rates,
except among severely ill patients who require immediate hospitalization and among the disabled. But none of
the previous studies has estimated the lifetime effects of having access to the Medicare program—they only
investigated its short-term impacts. In other contexts, prior research has found that short-term evaluations can
miss important long-term effects. In the case of policies affecting health care access, this issue is particularly
important. Because Medicare covers important preventive care and helps participants to manage chronic
conditions, the cumulative impact of having access to Medicare might be big, even if its short-term impact is
limited. The main goal of this project is to estimate the long-term impact of Medicare on longevity for the
population as a whole and various subgroups. Prior work is often limited in its investigation of heterogeneity
because it relies on published aggregate mortality rates which are only broken down by geography, gender,
race/ethnicity, and age, but not by any other measure of socioeconomic status. Thus, a knowledge gap exists
on the lifetime effect of Medicare on individual (completed) longevity and whether this varies across
socioeconomic groups. The proposed exploratory project will examine the impact of Medicare’s introduction on
the longevity of the affected cohorts. When Medicare took effect in July 1966, it created variations in the age
when Medicare’s first-generation recipients gained Medicare coverage: for example, those born in 1902
became eligible at 65 whereas those born in 1891 gained eligibility at age 75. This project will use a large and
newly created dataset that links the US census with genealogical data. To our knowledge, this dataset will be
the largest dataset to date in the US containing information on both individual longevity as well as individual
socioeconomic characteristics. This study will first examine Medicare’s short-term effects on annual mortality
rates, reevaluating previous studies but using individual-level data, and extending the results to look at effects
among various subgroups (Aim 1). Then, this project will investigate the cumulative long-term effect of
Medicare on longevity by comparing the average longevity of individuals who gained Medicare at different ages
using an interrupted time-series analysis, for all and by subgroup (Aim 2). Finally, the project will leverage
geographic and individual variation in private health insurance before Medicare’s introduction to estimate the
causal lifetime effect of Medicare on longevity (Aim 3). A difference-in-differences strategy will be used: we will
assess if the changes in longevity for groups who gained Medicare coverage at age 65 or at older ages are
greater for those who were already likely to have private health insurance, either because of their geographic
location or their personal characteristics. The analysis will be repeated based on occupation, education,
income, and other measures of socioeconomic status."

10766259,"The primary focus of this research proposal is the discovery and elucidation of novel
biochemical pathways for the biosynthesis and metabolism of complex and simple
carbohydrates in the human gut microbiome. The total number of genes contained within the
distinct bacterial species that inhabit the human gut exceeds the number of human genes by
more than two orders of magnitude. The metabolic diversity within these bacteria contributes
significantly to the maintenance of human health and physiology. Unfortunately, a significant
fraction of the enzymes and metabolic pathways contained within the bacterial species localized
in the human gut have an uncertain, unknown, or incorrect functional annotation. This
uncertainty demonstrates that a substantial fraction of the metabolic potential found within the
human gut microbiome remains to be properly characterized. The experimental approach for
the discovery and elucidation of novel biochemical pathways for the metabolism of complex
carbohydrates will employ the concerted and synergistic utilization of computational biology,
bioinformatics, three-dimensional protein structure determination, metabolomics, and physical
screening of focused compound libraries. This investigation will further be directed towards a
complete understanding of the assembly and biosynthesis of the diverse capsular
polysaccharides in the human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, the leading cause of human
gastroenteritis world-wide. The capsular polysaccharides are important for the invasion and
colonization of the host organism and the monosaccharides that comprise the CPS in various
strains of C. jejuni are unusual and complex. This endeavor will focus on the elucidation of the
molecular pathways for the biosynthesis of the unusual array of monosaccharide building blocks
and the associated molecular logic for the directed assembly of unique polysaccharide sequences
by a series of sugar transferase enzymes. The determination of the substrate and reaction
diversity contained within these newly discovered enzyme-catalyzed reactions will provide
unique insights into the molecular mechanisms for the evolution and development of novel
enzymatic activities and will provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
10770444,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mammalian rod and cone photoreceptors are indispensible for vision. They convert light into electrical
response, which is then propagated to the downstream neurons, the ON-bipolar cells (ON-BC). Deficits in
synaptic communication with the ON-bipolar neurons are known to cause congenital stationary blindness in
humans, a condition characterized by poor light sensitivity and frequent co-morbidity with many other ocular
conditions. Our long-term goal is to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of signal transmission at
photoreceptor to ON-bipolar synapse with the hope to better understand blinding conditions and devising
strategies for their treatment.
 During the last several years we and others have identified a number of molecules that enable synaptic
transmission of photoreceptor signals. In addition to canonical pre- and post- synaptic elements that coordinate
neurotransmitter release and its reception, these include several cell adhesion-like molecules with poorly
understood functions. Intriguingly, our work over the previous funding period suggested that these emerging
molecules are engaged in trans-synaptic bridging of presynaptic release machinery of photoreceptors with
postsynaptic receptors in the ON-BC. Specifically, we found that the key postsynaptic receptor mGluR6 on ON-
BC interacts with a cell-adhesion molecule: ELFN1 in rods and ELFN2 in cones. Similarly, the orphan receptor
GPR179 that negatively regulates mGluR6 signaling in the ON-BC interacts with pre-synaptic dystroglycan
complex (DGC) in photoreceptors.
 These observations lead to the central hypothesis of the proposal that precise synaptic
communication of photoreceptors with the downstream ON-BC requires assembly of the signaling complex
where interactions between individual elements are tightly orchestrated. We plan on testing this hypothesis by
pursuing two complementary Specific Aims that will: 1) determine the roles and mechanisms of ELFN
proteins in photoreceptors and 2) delineate the organization and function of trans-synaptic DGC-orphan
receptor GPR179 complex. The strategy proposed to address these Aims will entail a synergistic combination
of biochemical, cell biological, and physiological approaches exploiting a powerful array of precise tools and
animal models.
 Better understanding of synaptic mechanisms of photoreceptors will yield important insights into light
sensory function of the retina and may suggest novel nodes of intervention for treating inherited types of night
blindness."

Aptamers are oligonucleotide-based receptors that can be isolated from the large libraries of random
oligonucleotides to bind to small molecules. In the past, our team developed systematic approaches to tailor
aptamers to specific applications and turn them into sensors, while also validating them for clinical use. Our
work culminated in electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, the first ever general sensing platform
capable of monitoring drugs in real time in the living body. When employed in closed-loop feedback control,
this breakthrough enabled us to control the levels of drugs in the blood of awake, ambulatory animal subjects
in real time. Via the research program proposed here, we will translate this progress into clinical applications
focused on patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
One out of three hospital deaths in the USA are due to sepsis, sepsis is the leading cause of acute kidney
injury (AKI) in hospitals, and sepsis-induced AKI results in a mortality rate in intensive care units (ICU) >60%.
Due to greatly reduced renal function these critically ill patients often require CRRT. This, in turn, leads to a
widely recognized (“big”) problem: how to appropriately dose medications, including life-saving antibiotics, in
hemodynamically unstable patients with wildly divergent and highly variable drug clearance rates. Here we
propose to bridge the specific gap in technology that is needed to solve this problem.
The focus of our work will be on E-AB sensors that can continuously monitor drug elimination in effluent
produced during CRRT, thus providing complete information on extracorporeal clearance in real time. We will
pursue two antibiotic groups with narrow therapeutic windows that are predominantly cleared via the kidneys:
vancomycin and the aminoglycosides. In a contrast to the existing therapeutic drug monitoring protocols with
turnaround times of many hours, our approach will return immediately actionable information to the clinician,
which can be used to adjust dosages. There is a broad consensus that such an information would improve
outcomes in septic CRRT patients with AKI, by enabling rapid, accurate, and personalized dosing adjustment.
We will first validate our E-AB sensors on matched whole blood and effluent clinical samples. Next, we will
validate the applicability of our technology to CRRT monitoring by implementing sensors in an in vitro model
simulating typical CRRT modalities, with sets of sensors monitoring drug levels continuously on both the blood
and effluent sides of filtration membranes. Finally, we will demonstrate extended, real-time therapeutic drug
monitoring in the spent dialysis fluids of real patients in the ICU. At the end of this work, aptameric sensors will
be ready for clinical trials of their efficacy in the treatment of sepsis in patients on CRRT."
10769779,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
With current treatment options, the five-year survival rate of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is only 5%.
Oncolytic viruses are promising treatments against solid tumors, including malignant gliomas. In a phase I
clinical trial evaluating Delta-24-RGD, an oncolytic adenovirus characterized in our laboratory, 20% of recurrent
GBM patients receiving the virus achieved a durable response, surviving more than 3 years from the time of
treatment, suggesting the existence of a subgroup of patients who would respond to adenoviral treatments.
The clinical trial also showed that the efficacy of Delta-24-RGD was due to not only direct tumor cell oncolysis,
but also indirect activation of anti-tumor immune responses, a paradigm-shifting finding that radically
repositions virotherapy as a type of immunotherapy. Therefore, understanding the interplay between the
oncolytic effects of adenoviruses and the viral-mediated anti-glioma immune activation is critical in determining
how to increase the efficacy of these promising agents. Our group generated and preclinically characterized an
immune agonist-armed version of Delta-24-RGD, named Delta-24-RGDOX, which expresses the T-cell
activator OX40L, which will be soon translated to the clinical setting. In this project, we aim to amplify the effect
of Delta-24-RGDOX with the administration of inhibitors of the factors that maintain the immunosuppression
characteristic of gliomas. Because indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase (IDO) expression increases significantly after
virus infection, we are particularly interested in developing strategies to downmodulate IDO during virotherapy.
The catabolism of tryptophan by IDO has important metabolic effects in glioma cells. In addition, the
metabolites of tryptophan, including kynurenine (Kyn), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that
induces Treg differentiation and CD8+ T-cell dysfunction. The central hypothesis of this study is that therapy
consisting of Delta-24-RGDOX in combination with IDO and AhR inhibitors will stimulate a cytotoxic immune
effect and inhibit the suppressive immune response against the tumor cells, thereby providing a potential
effective novel treatment for malignant gliomas. To test this hypothesis, we propose three aims: Specific Aim
1: Examine the activation of the IDO-Kyn-AhR pathway during the infection of gliomas with Delta-24-RGDOX
oncolytic adenovirus; Specific Aim 2: Identify the metabolic and immune modifications in the tumor
microenvironment produced by the inhibition of the IDO-Kyn-AhR pathway in gliomas treated with Delta-24-
RGDOX; and Specific Aim 3: Test the combination of Delta-24-RGDOX and IDO/AhR inhibitors in pre-
clinically relevant models of gliomas. This project is the next step in achieving our long-term goal of legitimizing
viro-immunotherapy as standard treatment for malignant gliomas."
10771993,"Epidemiologic identification and mechanistic investigation of early life environmental risk factors for
eosinophilic esophagitis
ABSTRACT
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a recently recognized immune-mediated disease defined by abnormal
infiltration of eosinophils into the esophageal mucosa, leading to failure to thrive, abdominal pain, vomiting, and
heartburn in children, and progressing to esophageal stenosis and food impaction in adults. Though initially
thought to be rare, the incidence and prevalence are rising dramatically, and over the past decade EoE has
rapidly become a major cause of upper gastrointestinal morbidity. Despite increases in the understanding of
the condition, it is currently not possible to determine why individual patients develop EoE. This is frustrating
for patients and practitioners alike. EoE is considered to be an immune/allergen-mediated disease, and
epidemiologic studies support a primarily environmental etiology. However, environmental risk factors have
not been extensively studied in EoE, and prior studies, including by our own group, are limited by a crude
assessment of exposures, recall bias, inability to assess fetal biomarkers, and lack of mechanistic
understanding. Our goal is to address this knowledge gap by using an innovative method to precisely measure
early life exposures in deciduous (primary, or “baby”) teeth that may be implicated in EoE development. Of
particular interest are early life antibiotic exposure and duration and intensity of breastfeeding (which can be
derived from barium levels in teeth). Increased antibiotic exposure and decreased breastfeeding have been
linked to risk of atopic diseases. Measuring selected environmental exposures in teeth has never been applied
to EoE, but we have documented the feasibility of this approach. This assessment, together with the use of
novel cellular and molecular techniques for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effects of these early
life exposures, has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of EoE. Our
hypothesis is that the risk of EoE related to early life exposures is primarily due to an impaired esophageal
epithelial barrier, and that genetic susceptibility will interact with the exposures to modify risk. The specific
aims are to 1) determine the association between early life antibiotic exposure and EoE; 2) determine whether
breastfeeding is associated with EoE, and evaluate whether the susceptibility genotype for CAPN14 modifies
the association between breastfeeding and EoE; and 3) determine the functional significance and mechanisms
of early life exposures on esophageal epithelial architecture and barrier function. To achieve these aims, we
will conduct a case-control study to characterize temporal exposures, and in parallel will perform mechanistic
analyses. This innovative, hypothesis-driven, and rigorously designed study will lead to robust and unbiased
results. It will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team with recognized expertise in EoE, epidemiology,
clinical/translational/lab research, and exposure science. The results will have a major impact on the
understanding of EoE etiology and by potentially identifying opportunities for disease prevention which could
lead to the development of new treatment options."
10765648,"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases affecting
12.5 million people worldwide and by far, the most common genetic disease of the kidney. It is caused by
inactivating mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes, encoding a receptor-channel complex (Polycystins or
PKD1/PKD2). A hallmark of ADPKD is increased cell proliferation. However, how mutations in the Polycystin
genes cause increased cell proliferation is not completely understood. A key organelle in disease development
and progression is the primary cilium, an antenna-like organelle housing several mitogenic signaling pathways.
Genetic and pharmacologic studies show that primary cilia ablation or acceleration of cilia disassembly reduces
cell proliferation, suppresses cystic growth and improves kidney function, whereas deceleration of ciliary
disassembly has the opposite effects in mouse models of ADPKD. While these observations are of paramount
importance in understanding the pathophysiology of ADPKD and in developing therapeutic approaches to slow
down disease progression, a unifying theory connecting cilia and cell proliferation in ADPKD is lacking. Ciliary
assembly and disassembly or shedding are normal processes of actively proliferating cells. Cilia assemble in
quiescent cells, while disassemble or shed when cells re-enter the cell cycle (G1/S). Our preliminary data show
that deletion of Pkd1 increases the activity/levels of p53, which in turn, induces the expression of the substrate
recognition receptor FBW7 of the SCFFBW7 Ubiquitin E3 ligase. FBW7 targets for proteasomal degradation a
subset of disassembly factors delaying deciliation and stabilizing primary cilia. Continuous presence of cilia
during the G1/S transition leads to sustained mitogenic signaling mediated by stabilized/remaining cilia resulting
in more cells eventually entering the cell cycle. Finally, genetic modifications of this pathway, improve renal
function of Pkd1-null mice. These results help explain the increased cell proliferation seen in ADPKD kidneys
and the positive effect of cilia on disease progression. Using a vertical approach combining biochemical, cell
biological, and genetic methods, we will determine the role of ciliary disassembly and shedding in cystic kidney
disease progression. Successful completion of the proposed will have a significant impact on our understanding
the biological role of ciliary disassembly/shedding in disease progression and on helping develop new
therapeutic approaches for ADPKD."

People with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD) display overall the same clinical and pathological features as those with early-onset familial AD (FAD). However, the mechanism(s) underlying the clinicopathologic commonality between these two genetically distinct AD forms is unclear. Our overall hypothesis is that a subpopulation of wild-type neurons in the brain strikingly recapitulates the phenotypes of neurons expressing FAD mutant Presenilin (PSEN) (perhaps via post-translational modification of wild-type PSEN1), and this selective cell population plays a role in SAD neurodegeneration. Several pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. First, we showed that wild-type PSEN1 in a subset of neurons within the SAD brain displays a conformation similar to FAD mutant PSEN1 (Wahlster et al. Acta Neuropathol 2013). Second, we uncovered that PKA-mediated PSEN1 phosphorylation at Ser310 is significantly upregulated in SAD brains, and this post translational modification, together with phosphorylation of two other sites, steers wild-type PSEN1 conformation towards that of FAD mutant PSEN1 (Maesako et al. eLife 2017). Lastly, we have recently developed novel genetically encoded FRET-based biosensors that for the first time allow quantitative recording of the gamma-secretase activity over time, on a cell-by-cell basis, in live neurons (Maesako et al. iScience 2020, Houser et al. Sensors 2020, Houser et al. Biosensors 2021, Maesako et al. J Neurosci 2022). Surprisingly, these biosensors have enabled us to discover a unique subpopulation of wild-type neurons displaying diminished endogenous gamma-secretase activity. More importantly, our strong preliminary data show that this cell population recapitulates several key characteristics that have been identified in neurons expressing FAD mutant PSEN; these include impaired gamma-secretase “processivity” and thus predominant production of long Aβ, endo-lysosomal abnormalities, and vulnerability phenotypes in response to toxic insults. Therefore, this proposal will further employ multiple model systems and complementary assays to establish the molecular basis and physiological relevance that support our hypothesis. Aim 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the heterogeneity in endogenous gamma-secretase activity and its consequences in neurons. Aim 2 will further verify the cause-and-effect relationship between dysfunctional gamma-secretase, endo-lysosomal abnormalities, and neuronal vulnerability. More importantly, we will explore the therapeutic potential of the US FDA-approved compounds that could potentially function as gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) or gamma-secretase activators (GSAs). Aim 3 will determine if the unique FAD-like neuronal population exists in “AD” mouse models endogenously expressing wild-type PSEN, as our preliminary results indicate, in iPSCs derived human neurons and post-mortem brains from SAD cases. Given that promoting neuronal resilience could be a new therapeutic strategy for AD, a better understanding of the molecular basis behind the newly discovered selectively vulnerable cell population will open a new path for developing novel therapeutic opportunities."

also encouraged to apply their expertise to environmental health research. The pilot project grants are
designed to assist investigators in obtaining preliminary data that will be useful for competitive, full-scale grant
applications in the area of gene-environment interaction (GxE). The Center especially encourages applications
that focus on the role of human genetic and epigenetic variation as modifiers of environmentally induced
diseases. These grants may also focus on research-based community outreach activities. The EDGE Pilot

10844517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Admission to the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for an acute neurological illness (ANI; e.g., stroke, tumor, TBI)
is often sudden and traumatic. Approximately 20-40% of survivors and their caregivers endorse clinically significant
emotional distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) at hospitalization, which tend to become chronic and negatively
impact the recovery trajectory and overall quality of life. Unfortunately, there are no efficacious interventions to prevent
chronic emotional distress in these patients and caregivers. With funding from NINR, our multidisciplinary team recently
conducted a pilot study examining the delivery of a brief, 6-session ( 2 in person, 4 via live video) dyadic resiliency
intervention (Recovering Together) to prevent chronic emotional distress in at risk survivors and caregivers. In a single
blind RCT of Recovering Together versus a time, dose and attention matched educational control, we met a priori set
markers of feasibility, acceptability, credibility and adherence. We also observed statistically and clinically significant
effects of the active intervention on reduction in symptoms of emotional distress and PTS. Findings have been published in
JAMA Network. For the proposed project, we seek to build on our prior positive findings by conducting a fully powered,
efficacy, single blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention in a larger sample of dyads of patients with ANI
and their caregivers. The goals of this study are to:1) demonstrate the efficacy of Recovering Together for improving self-
reported dyadic emotional distress (primary outcome), and PTS, mindfulness, coping, and interpersonal interaction variables
(secondary outcomes); and 2) assess mechanisms (mediators and moderators) of improvement after intervention. We will
enroll and randomly assign 194 at risk dyads (97 per study group) to receive either Recovering Together or the attention
placebo educational control. The trial will take place at the Massachusetts General Hospital NICU using our established
methodology successfully implemented during the R21. Study clinicians will deliver 6, 30 minute sessions (2 at bedside
and 4 via live video after discharge) to each patient-caregiver dyad. All participants will complete measures at baseline,
after completion of program (6 weeks) and 3 months later. Data from this R01 will ultimately serve as the basis to apply for
funding for a large-scale, multisite hybrid effectiveness-implementation study followed by scalability of Recovering
Together to other NICUs from across USA."
10752616,"Project Abstract
 Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at disproportionate risk of poor health behaviors,
experiences and outcomes compared to their straight, cisgender peers. SGM youth, however, are not a
homogenous population; each has multiple social identities that affect the risk and protection they experience.
Intersectionality refers to ways in which power and privilege are structured based on interrelated social
positions (e.g. due to race/ethnicity, immigrant status, native language) and how individual experiences reflect
processes that confer privilege and disadvantage. Mutually constitutive forms of social oppression (e.g., stigma
simultaneously based on race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation) may differentially affect the health of
SGM people with multiple marginalized social positions. Living within these intersecting social positions may
give rise to unique challenges as well as strengths that promote healthy development among youth.
 The landmark 2011 National Academy of Medicine (NAM) report on the health of SGM populations and
additional recent reports have highlighted the need for health research using an intersectionality framework,
explicitly including both risk and resilience, to inform interventions supporting SGM youth. Building on the
nascent literature suggesting that Latino and Black/African American SGM youth might be at heightened risk,
the proposed study responds to NOT-MD-19-001 and addresses the following research question regarding
SGM adolescents (12-19 years old): 1) What are differences in bullying, risk behaviors, emotional distress, and
protective factors among youth with different social positions (i.e. racial/ethnic groups, immigrant experiences,
and native language)? 2) How do differences in protective factors and other characteristics explain differences
in these outcomes among youth with different social positions? and 3) What positive and negative experiences
are particularly relevant to the overlapping, simultaneous production of inequalities by SGM identity,
race/ethnicity, immigration experiences, and native language? We will answer these questions with two study
aims: First, conduct extensive analysis of three existing adolescent health datasets: the Minnesota
Student Survey (N~122,000), California Healthy Kids Survey (N~1,042,000), and the LGBTQ National Teen
Survey (N~17,000), which have different samples, demographic profiles, and measures. We will test multiple
hypotheses using both harmonized and parallel analyses. Second, conduct qualitative interviews with 64-80
SGM youth from different social positions to more deeply understand quantitative findings and generate
concrete, relevant recommendations for interventions. We will focus on up to four intersecting social positions
where SGM youth face the greatest disparities, as identified in Aim A, and specific protective factors identified
in Aim A will be the focus of interviews to “dig deep” beyond brief survey measures. Qualitative findings will
provide critical information on interpersonal and community assets for the most vulnerable SGM youth and how
they can be bolstered for other young people."

 The metadata that describe scientific data are fundamental resources to enable (1) the
discovery and reuse of the data and (2) the reproducibility of the experiments that generated the
data in the first place. Metadata are essential for scientists to understand the associated data
and to reuse them, as well as for information technology to index the data, to make the data
available, and to provide filters for scientists to search for the corresponding datasets.
Currently, the scientific metadata hosted in public repositories suffer from multiple quality issues
that limit scientists’ ability to find and reuse the experimental datasets to which they refer. It can
take many weeks of a scientist’s time to identify a collection of datasets that fulfill specific
criteria when the data are so poorly described—and the majority of the process is necessarily
manual.
 We propose to develop an end-to-end solution to standardize biomedical metadata with the
help of ontologies—data structures that define the terms in an application domain and the
relationships among them. There are hundreds of ontologies that provide standard terms for
use in biomedicine, and they are essential resources to make biomedical metadata
interoperable and reusable. Our approach also will build on the technology created by the
Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which offers a library of building
blocks and common data elements for defining computer-based metadata templates based on
community standards.
 Our plan involves three specific aims. First, we will develop a method and tool to standardize
the multiple, ad hoc metadata field names that may appear in metadata to represent the same
type of information by replacing those field names with the field names used in standard
metadata templates or, if no appropriate template match is available, with terms from a relevant
ontology. Second, we will develop methods and tools to standardize different types of metadata
field values, for example, categorical values such as drugs or diseases, and numerical values
such as age, or sample collection date. Third, we will evaluate the speed, precision, and recall
of our metadata transformation pipeline—built out of the methods and tools to standardize field
names and values—on a large corpus of metadata that we will manually curate based on
existing public metadata. We will also carry out experiments to test the effect of the
standardized metadata when biomedical scientists perform dataset search in the context of their
work."

High asleep systolic blood pressure (SBP) and a non-dipping blood pressure (BP) pattern (a
<10% decrease in SBP from being awake to asleep) are very common, each with a prevalence
>30%, and both are associated with a 1.5 to 3-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease
(CVD) morbidity and mortality. Circadian and sleep-related factors are two of the most likely
contributors to high asleep SBP and non-dipping BP. A better understanding of both circadian
and sleep contributions, as well as the alignment between sleep behaviors and chronotype, to
asleep BP levels and rhythms will allow for the development of interventions to lower asleep
BP, restore BP dipping, and reduce BP-related CVD.
The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine the associations of chronotype and
sleep-related factors with mean BP, and BP dipping (Aim 1); the association of alignment
between sleep timing and chronotype with mean BP, and BP dipping (Aim 2); and the
association of circadian phase and amplitude with BP dipping under constant conditions (Aim
3). The proposed study, titled “Sleep and Circadian Contributions to Nighttime Blood Pressure
(SCN-BP)” will achieve Aims 1 and 2 by collecting sleep and circadian data using questionnaires
and wrist actigraphy as part of a large, diverse cohort of research participants at 3 sites (the
University of Alabama at Birmingham [UAB], Columbia University Medical Center, and Kaiser
Permanente Southern California). SCN-BP will then enroll participants who successfully
complete Aims 1 and 2 at UAB to complete a 30-hour Constant Routine (CR) Protocol to
determine circadian phase and amplitude, as well as BP levels under constant conditions.
Findings from the proposed study will provide data that are critical to understand two of the
most likely factors that contribute to high asleep BP and non-dipping BP, as well as generate
preliminary data to examine the impact of non-sleep factors (e.g., feeding) on asleep BP levels
and dipping. The proposed study is unique in that it will combine population science
approaches in Aims 1 and 2 with basic/clinical science approaches in Aim 3 in a large, diverse
sample sufficiently powered to examine differences by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
antihypertensive medication use. The proposed study will allow for the development of
interventions to lower asleep BP, restore BP dipping, and reduce BP-related CVD."
10791845,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus routes visual signals from the eye to the visual
cortex and provides critical support for conscious visual sensation. Rather than being a simple relay station, a
growing body of evidence is revealing that the mouse dLGN plays an active role in shaping visual information
flow to the cortex by selectively converging and integrating diverse streams of inputs. Studies of retinal inputs to
the dLGN have provided rich knowledge about the organization and development of neural circuits for
mammalian species. However, much less is known about the non-retinal inputs although they contribute to ~90%
of total inputs to the dLGN. How the visual and behavioral state information conveyed by non-retinal inputs
combines with information from the retina to impact thalamic visual processing remains a topic of great
experimental and theoretical interest. Direct functional characterization of inputs to the dLGN in awake behaving
animals has been hindered by the difficulty in performing high-resolution recording of subcortical brain regions.
To address this challenge, we established a chronic, high-resolution, deep-brain two-photon calcium imaging
platform to simultaneously measure visual responses in hundreds of retinal axonal boutons. Here, we have
further expanded our imaging capacity to simultaneously record signals from calcium indicators of two different
colors that are expressed in retinal and non-retinal inputs respectively. With these innovations, we will determine
how the diverse inputs from the midbrain superior colliculus coordinate with retinal inputs at multiple levels to
reinforce or broaden channels of visual information in the dLGN. The highly conserved colliculogeniculate axons
possess several synaptic properties that resemble those of retinogeniculate axons, including comingling axonal
boutons on the proximal dendrites of dLGN neurons and providing strong synaptic inputs that can elicit neural
firing in target neurons. However, it remains unclear how the collicular inputs combine with retinal inputs and
contribute to visual responses of dLGN neurons. In Aim 1, we will determine the functional and spatial
relationships between retinal and collicular inputs to the dLGN. In Aim 2, we will reveal the modulation of
colliculogeniculate inputs by behavioral states. In Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of collicular inputs to
visual responses of dLGN neurons. These experiments will reveal rules for functional convergence between
retinal and collicular inputs and demonstrate how they act in concert or in competition to sculpt thalamic visual
computation. Our findings will also contribute to the understanding of how afferent visual signals are transformed
into visual feature selectivity in the dLGN and how behavioral states impact this process, providing the foundation
for the understanding and treatment of neurological disorders involving improper neural circuit connectivity and
signal integration."

This is a mentored clinical scientist research career development proposal for a junior physician who clinically
treats post-surgical lymphedema and is training to become an independent investigator. Lymphedema results
from lymphatic dysfunction and is characterized by limb enlargement. It is most commonly caused by iatrogenic
injury to the lymphatic system secondary to lymph node excision during the surgical management of cancer (e.g,
breast cancer and melanoma). It is estimated that 5-10 million Americans have lymphedema and 250 million
people are affected worldwide. Morbidity from this chronic condition includes frequent infection, pain, and altered
function. There is currently no cure for this disease. Management includes compression, excisional procedures,
and microsurgical operations vascularized lymph node transfer and lymphovenous bypass (LVB). During LVB,
lymphatics in the affected extremity are anastomosed to veins to bypass the injured area. The operation is
technically challenging, time consuming, and requires advanced equipment.
One-third of patients develop lymphedema following lymphadenectomy. The two thirds of those patients that do
not develop lymphedema have transient postoperative limb swelling which resolves spontaneously. Similarly, a
mouse tail model of lymphedema spontaneously resolves the swelling. We propose the novel hypothesis that
lymphedema-induced spontaneous lymphovenous shunts and lymphangiogenesis lead to the physiological
resolution of lymphedema. We use a murine tail model of lymphedema to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will
determine the mechanism responsible for spontaneous resolution of lymphedema. In addition, this proposal
presents an innovative approach using tissue nanotransfection technology (TNT) to induce lymphovenous
shunts and lymphangiogenesis to improve lymphedema. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that TNT can be used to
topically, focally deliver genetic cargo to improve lymphedema by targeting the C-type lectin like receptor (CLEC-
2), Syk, and Slp76 pathways which keep lymphatics separated from veins. Inducing lymphovenous shunts would
act similarly to LVB currently performed clinically to treat lymphedema.
In summary, these experiments will be high impact in identifying the mechanism of spontaneous lymphatic
resolution. The proposed work adopts a novel approach to managing lymphedema using focal, non-global TNT
directly at the affected area. The candidate is an Assistant Professor at Indiana University who is dedicated to
becoming a physician-scientist. He has obtained a previous Master’s degree in translational and clinical research
at Harvard Medical School. The candidate has multiple pilot and foundation grants, a startup research package,
dedicated laboratory space, and 40% protected time which will be increased to 75% upon obtaining the K08
grant. There is an expert mentorship panel, including the Vice-Chair of Surgery and the candidate’s Division
Chief, who are well funded and experienced in mentoring physician scientists. There is strong institutional
commitment which will facilitate the candidate transition to an independent investigator."
10808168,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical potential of HBI-002, a novel oral low dose carbon
monoxide (CO) drug product, that enables the use of low dose CO to prevent Vaso-Occlusive Crises (VOCs) in
Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Numerous studies, both preclinical and clinical, demonstrate that CO has dual
mechanisms of action including anti-sickling and anti-inflammatory processes. We have produced preclinical
efficacy data in two transgenic SCD mouse models with HBI-002 similar to those reported in three studies using
four different transgenic SCD mouse models and other modes of low dose CO administration, all of which
demonstrate that low doses of CO are a promising approach to limiting vascular stasis, reducing hemolysis, and
down-regulating inflammatory processes. In addition, proof of concept clinical efficacy studies in SCD
demonstrated improvements in SCD efficacy biomarkers, and epidemiological evidence also supports the
therapeutic potential of low dose CO in SCD. These studies provide compelling support for a potential beneficial
role for HBI-002 in limiting SCD morbidity.
The safety and tolerability of low dose CO has been demonstrated by others in 21 successfully completed Phase
1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in various indications, including two Phase 1b studies in SCD patients, using a
variety of forms of CO administration. Moreover, there are ongoing clinical studies with low dose CO, using
various forms of CO administration, including a Phase 1 study with HBI-002. The absence of toxicity of CO at
low levels of carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) has been well defined in the literature, indicating the potential for a
wide safety margin and appropriate benefit:risk ratio at the COHb levels in the studies described above, which
are the target COHb levels being considered for SCD patients with HBI-002. However, barriers to chronic dosing
of CO with prior therapeutic administrative approaches have prevented the development of a low dose CO
therapeutic used chronically for the prevention of VOCs. To date, inhaled CO gas (iCO) and CO bound to carrier
molecules such as hemoglobin (CORMs, also termed CO prodrugs) have been the modalities of choice in the
majority of studies. However, these other forms of low dose CO are not expected to be viable therapeutic options
for chronic dosing due to, with iCO, the risk of inadvertent exposure from the presence of compressed CO
cylinders as well as difficulties in controlling dosing and, with CORMs, carrier molecule toxicity, stability, and CO
release characteristics, all of which have proven to be substantial barriers to development.
HBI-002, a novel oral low dose CO drug product, enables the chronic use of low dose CO in SCD and is being
developed for the prevention of VOCs in SCD. The administration of a low, defined dose of CO delivered by oral
HBI-002 enables the further development of low dose CO as a therapeutic while obviating the problems
associated with iCO or CORMs. Preclinical studies with orally administered HBI-002 have demonstrated proof-
of-concept efficacy, safety, and bioavailability. These preclinical data strongly point to efficacy in preventing vaso-
occlusion in SCD. In this application, we combine the expertise of Hillhurst with its innovative
technology and propose to build on compelling data to study the proof of concept efficacy, safety, and
pharmacokinetics of HBI-002 in SCD subjects."
10771202,"Most CNS neurons express GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which mediate inhibition.
GABAARs are comprised of 5 subunits. Two of these are α and two are β subunits. The fifth is usually γ2 or δ.
Although the fifth is not required for gating, in recombinant receptors the presence of the γ2 or δ subunit
dramatically alters biophysical and pharmacological properties. In native cells, the fifth subunit is thought to
mark specific roles in tonic (δ subunit) and phasic (γ2 subunit) inhibition. We do not understand the
physiological contributions of receptor subclasses defined by these subunits, although emerging evidence
suggests that receptor subclasses have distinct roles in mental functions, and therapeutic drugs target one or
the other subclass to produce different psychoactive effects. For instance, neurosteroids, which may have δ-selective actions, are emerging antidepressants. No antagonist exists to separate δ receptors from γ2
receptors, so many questions about their respective contributions remain. We were compelled by the
shortcomings of previous approaches and the historical advantages of selective antagonism to create mouse
lines with a point mutation in either γ2 or δ, which endows resistance to the non-competitive GABAAR
antagonist picrotoxin. Preliminary data show the potential utility of these tools. Here, we test the overarching
hypothesis that δ receptors mediate δ-driven disinhibition in cortical areas including the hippocampus. We will
explore the role of δ receptors in cell classes known to express δ and that may offer a substrate for δ-driven
disinhibition. Finally, we will test the impact of δ receptors in circuits of the hippocampus and thalamus
important for neuropsychiatric illness, with the hypothesis that δ-driven disinhibition drives γ oscillations
responsible for aspects of cognition, and δ receptors separately drive sleep spindles in thalamocortical circuits.
Our recent results have already altered prevailing views and allow us to interrogate roles of receptor
subpopulations in cellular and network function. Our approach will guide rational drug development aimed at
inhibition."
10788410,"Project Summary/Abstract
Accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk in clinical settings is important for the appropriate management
and counseling of millions of patients. Current US treatment guidelines focus on a single risk score. This
approach has good overall performance but has limitations when applied to clinical setting. For example,
important new markers or specific missing patterns cannot be accommodated with established, guideline-
endorsed prediction scores. Scores also often over or under predict in new populations or subgroups. These
gaps call for exploring approaches to risk prediction that go beyond a single model paradigm and beyond
classical Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression methods. At the same time, recent publications
question the utility of uninterpretable models in prognostic settings especially in high-stakes situations in
healthcare. Therefore we need to strike a balance between the sophistication of a model and its interpretability
in order to avoid potentially tragic consequences for patients in the near future.The goal of this project is to
address these issues. We will evaluate the improvement in discrimination and calibration of existing consensus
models such as the Super Learner and eXtreme Gradient Boosting in clinical settings and develop a novel
method called the Consensus Framework. This novel method has the consensus property because it
combines multiple published and validated risk models to ensure not only good overall performance but also
good performance in important subgroups of patients. The Consensus Framework is adapted to clinical
practice because it can handle limited information or additional risk factors. We will also assess specific
properties of prognostic risk prediction and how they inform the selection of the most appropriate class of
models. This project is relevant to public health because 1) the interpretability of the consensus models that
we propose to use ensures transparency in the assessment of their quality and limitations, which is of
paramount importance in high-stakes decision making in healthcare, 2) their flexibility to accommodate missing
data or the availability of known risk factors will produce more personalized treatment decisions, 3) a better
understanding of the unique properties of prognostic risk prediction will dictate a more informative choice of
prognostic model. All these factors will lead to better informed treatment decisions for millions of patients."

DNA damage is a serious threat to genome stability. This is because it interferes with DNA
replication leading to mutations and chromosomal rearrangements – the hallmarks of cancer,
aging, and other diseases. To ensure genome stability, cells utilize DNA damage bypass
pathways to cope with DNA damage during replication. The long-term goal of our research
program is to understand how DNA damage bypass is carried out in eukaryotic systems at the
structural and mechanistic level. Our research will focus on two damage bypass pathways:
translesion synthesis and template switching. Progress in this field has slowed recently because
of the challenges associated with studying how the various bypass components assemble into
and function within large, dynamic, multi-protein complexes. We have developed the
biochemical, biological, biophysical, computational, and structural tools needed to overcome
these challenges. This puts us in a unique position to answer many fundamental questions
about damage bypass. Our future research plan is organized into three broad projects. First, we
will study the regulation of DNA damage bypass. This will be done by determining how bypass
complexes are assembled at stalled replication forks and by determining how this assembly is
controlled by PCNA-ubiquitylating enzymes. Second, we will study the mechanisms of
translesion synthesis. This will be done by determining how the most appropriate non-classical
polymerase is chosen to bypass the damage and by determining how each non-classical
polymerase accommodates damaged DNA templates. Third, we will study the mechanisms of
template switching. This will be done by determining how the remodeling of the replication fork
allows for the bypass of DNA damage and by determining how this process is carried out by
fork-remodeling DNA helicases. In answering these questions, we will gain important new
insights into the maintenance of genome stability."
10767817,"ABSTRACT
Upon encountering antigens, mature B cells express activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and undergo
immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR
proceeds through the obligate generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which constitute one of the
most toxic lesions that can occur in a cell. A single unrepaired DSB can cause cell death or potentiate
chromosomal translocations that are hallmarks of many types of cancer, including lymphomas. Thus,
mechanisms that promote generation of DSBs and facilitate DSB repair are intergral to both immunity and
preservation of genomic integrity. In this proposal we test the notion that single proteins can coordinate both
DSB formation and mediate end-joining to efficiently generate and repair DSBs. We test the hypothesis that
the nucleosomal remodeling protein CHD4 co-ordinates generation and repair of Igh DSBs (aim 1) and the C-
terminus of AID mediates efficient DNA repair of Igh DSBs (aim 2). Successful completion of the experiments
will have far reaching implications in our understanding of both B cell immunity and B cell lymphomas."

Proposed investigations derive from two on-going R01 GM research programs. The study objectives
include the design, synthesis & investigation of synthetic models which will aid the elucidation of
fundamental aspects of structure, M-ligation, spectroscopy and reactivity relevant to copper and heme/M
(M = Cu, Fe) processing of molecular oxygen (O2(g)) and nitric oxide (NO(g)). Copper proteins of concern
include lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), particulate methane monooxygenases
(pMMOs), the enzyme family which includes dopamine beta-monooxygenase (DBM) and peptidylglycine
monooxygenase (PHM), and a coupled binuclear copper protein, NspF. Recent biochemical research
has raised questions concerning the nature of their active sites and the mechanism(s) of action involving
O2(g) activation and C-H hydroxylation. LPMOs may be peroxygenases (H2O2 co-substrate), new pMMO
studies suggest a mono-Cu active site, and it is now questioned as to whether DBM and PHM activate
O2 with a Cu versus a Cu2 center process. Relevant to these issues, there are clear needs to synthesize
and characterize the thus-far elusive copper(II)-oxyl (CuII-O·) species; it has the oxidizing ability needed
for the difficult LPMO or pMMO substrates. We also plan to elucidate fundamentals critical to the O-O
reductive cleavage process occurring in all monooxygenases (& oxidases). Also, we will generate and
characterize the structures, physical properties and reactivity of new high-valent binuclear Cu(II)-O-Cu(III)
or related complexes. Otherwise, proposed research will focus on the heme-copper active site present
in cytochrome c oxidases, where O2-binds and is reductively cleaved to give two mole-equiv water. The
study of synthetic models can help elucidate details and aid an understanding of structure, O2-binding,
proton or H-bonding facilitated O-O cleavage, and the role of the active-site phenol (in the His-Tyr
cofactor) as a proton-electron donor. Investigations are proposed to further investigate the mechanisms
of O-O cleavage in heme-peroxo-copper constructs, where the porphyrinate, the Fe axial ligand and
especially the ligand for copper ion, are systematically varied. A variety of approaches are planned,
including study of new chelates for copper which possess three N-donors and an appended phenol. NO(g)
synthetic model chemistry sub-projects with copper and heme-M will also be carried out. With copper
complexes, the focus will be on NO(g) reductive coupling, and investigation of mechanisms pertaining to
the NO(g) binding to metal ion(s), formation of the N–N bond giving putative hyponitrite N2O22–
intermediates, and proton and/or H-bonding contributions to N–O cleavage and formation of N2O.
Heme/Fe (or Cu) mediated NO(g) reductive coupling is critical in NO-Reductases and chemistry and
synthetic models for this process will be investigated. Metal-peroxynitrite (PN, from metal ion + O2(g) +
NO(g)) reactivity, especially toward CO2, will also be studied in relation to the relevant biological activity."

The Immunomics and Epigenomics Core (IEC) is an essential component of the overall program that will
centralize the execution of a number of assays that will enable the characterization of immune responses. The
overall proposal aims to understand epigenetic changes in patients infected by methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Candida albicans Candidemia (CAC) and the immunologic functions shaping
antibiotic-persistent from resolving outcomes. The IEC Core will provide skilled technical and scientific expertise
to enable the PIs to achieve their research goals by carrying out the following assays. We will characterize the
genetics and epigenetics of MRSA and CAC isolated from patient samples from long reads. Using PacBio
circular consensus sequences we will reconstruct the genomes of SA and Candida isolated derived from patient
samples, derive genomes and epigenomes of these microbes and related the data to patient outcomes. We will
profile transcriptomes and epigenomes from short read data. This will include the generation of whole genome
bisulfite sequencing libraries in order to characterize the cell types and their abundance in blood and plasma
DNA samples. Chromatin accessibility will be profiled using ATC-seq. Protein-DNA interaction will also be
profiled using CUT&Run protocols. Finally, we will also characterize innate and adaptive immune responses in
CAC and MRSA patient samples and the phenotype and function of PAMP-stimulated macrophages. The Core
has validated standardized cell cultures, immunophenotyping panels, multiplex Luminex, ultrasensitive Simoa

the data and working with the Bioinformatic and Data Management (BDM) Core to transfer the data and the

10782456,"Centrosomes are the major and best-understood microtubule-organizing centers
(MTOCs) in animal cells, yet in most differentiated cells non-centrosomal MTOCs
(ncMTOCs) redirect MT organization instead of the centrosome. The sheer
diversity of ncMTOCs reflects the different functions of various cell types and the
subcellular locations and mechanisms of MT assembly that serve those roles.
Understanding the molecular architecture of these ncMTOCs, the mechanisms of
MT assembly they employ, and the functions they serve to the diverse cell types
they serve remains an important frontier in cell biology and disease. The few
ncMTOCs that have been deciphered reveal architectures and mechanisms of
MT assembly as diverse as the functions they serve for the varied cell types. In
this proposal we expand on a project to define the functions of a perinuclear
ncMTOC in fat body cells which serves the cell by providing nuclear positioning
and is essential for retrograde endosomal trafficking to support the vital secretory
roles of this cell type. We will determine the unique molecular mechanisms of MT
assembly by two distinct protein complexes that control MT assembly/nucleation
from this ncMTOC. Specifically, this proposal aims to further define the structure
of the fat body ncMTOC on the nuclear surface, and to define the mechanisms of
MT assembly by Patronin and Ninein and how they cooperate with the
microtubule polymerase Minispindles (Msps) and other partners to nucleate MTs.
The outcomes of this project will be a definitive and novel understanding of the
molecular and physiological functions of the fat body ncMTOC, revealing
potentially novel disease etiologies for the proteins involved and the processes
that they regulate. Moreover, as a molecular MT nucleation paradigm that is
independent of the widespread microtubule nucleator gamma-tubulin, we will
define at least one new mechanism to generate MTs at MTOCs."

It has been estimated that 145,600 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC)
and 51,020 deaths were predicted due to this disease in 2019
(https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html). A better understanding of CRC at
the molecular level will certainly lead to therapies that are more effective. The genome-
level and transcriptome-level information cannot accurately reflect the protein-level
information because post-transcriptional regulation can modulate protein expression and
because post-translational modifications (PTMs) can influence protein function.
Quantitative proteomic studies of CRC are vital.
Many bottom-up proteomics studies have been completed on CRC cells and tumors, but
limited information on proteoforms have been acquired due to low protein sequence
coverages typically obtained from bottom-up proteomics. Different proteoforms from the
same gene can have drastically different functions. We hypothesize that large-scale
and quantitative top-down proteomics of human CRC cells and tumors will provide
new insights into CRC, leading to better therapies. In this proposal, we will develop
new analytical tools to boost the sensitivity and scale of top-down proteomics. The new
tools will enable large-scale and quantitative top-down proteomics of CRC cells before
and after metastasis as well as CRC tumors from patients with Lynch Syndrome. Results
from this proposal are extremely important. The novel analytical tools will boost the
sensitivity of top-down proteomics by tenfold and will be particularly useful for the
proteomics community for large-scale top-down proteomics of mass-limited samples.
Quantitative top-down proteomics of CRC cells before and after metastasis will generate
an unprecedented resource for the cancer biology community to gain new insights into
CRC metastasis. Quantitative top-down proteomics of the Lynch Syndrome tissues will
elucidate the roles played by mutations and functions of DNA mismatch repair genes in
Lynch Syndrome at the proteoform level."

(SCFAs) are products of gut microbiome. Among them, Acetate and valeric acid were found to
be positively correlated with the Aβ plaque load detected by amyloid PET in participants with or
without AD. However, the levels of SCFAs in the blood of patients with AD have not been
defined. Also, the usefulness of indices of inflammation and neuropathology in the blood as
biomarkers for cognitive impairment in patients with AD is elusive. Importantly, spousal
caregivers of patients with dementia have a higher risk of developing dementia later in life than
those whose spouses do not have dementia. The spousal caregivers have an accelerated
cognitive decline. The mechanisms for these phenomena are not known. We hypothesize that
spousal caregivers of patients with AD have gut microbiome and levels of blood SCFAs similar
to those of patients with AD, that these spouses have increased inflammatory cytokines and
indices of AD-like neuropathology in the blood, and that there is a correlation between the
cognition and various indices in the blood among patients with AD, their spouses and age-
matched controls. To address these hypotheses, we will recruit three groups of participants:
patients with AD, their spousal caregivers and controls that are age-matched with the
caregivers. Their gut microbiome and indices of neuroinflammation and neuropathology in the

The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the influence of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) care coordination services on parent health and stress according to geographic and
sociodemographic factors. Specifically, the aims of this study are to establish an assessment of
ASD severity that reflects co-occurring conditions, determine the impact of care coordination on
the association between child ASD and parent outcomes, and delineate variation in the impact
of care coordination on parent outcomes by sociodemographic influences, (i.e., race/ethnicity,
rural/urban areas, Health Professional Shortage Areas).
To achieve the aims of this proposal, we will merge the 2016-2019 National Survey of Children’s
Health (NSCH) to create the largest, nationally representative dataset that includes child,
parent, and healthcare-related variables. The combined sample includes 3,313 parents of
children with a current ASD diagnosis. The Health Resources and Services Administration
(HRSA) designations of primary care and mental health HPSAs will be analyzed to evaluate the
interrelation of multi-level ASD influences from a health equity framework. A moderated-
mediation model of ASD care coordination will be used to test for sociodemographic interaction
effects (i.e., moderation) in the degree to which care coordination explains the association
between ASD complexity and parent health and stress (i.e., mediation).
Completion of these aims will provide a direct response to federal initiatives to standardize and
evaluate child healthcare coordination. The Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability
Act (MSIAA) of 2019 will allow states to offer optional benefits that include care coordination
services for Medicaid-eligible children with medically complex conditions beginning in 2022.
Qualifying conditions under the MSIAA includes only “severe autism”, which excludes children
with mild or moderate autism that may have multiple other co-occurring conditions. Further,
there is broad inter-state variability in the availability and requirements for care coordination
offered in available health plans (Barth, 2019). The Department of Health and Human Services
(2020) is currently attempting to evaluate best practices in care coordination among out-of-state
providers for children with medically complex conditions, as not all states allow the service. Our
findings will contribute to initiatives for community-informed ASD care coordination."

10771978,"Branch vein occlusion (BVO) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are major causes of new onset blindness in
the US. These vascular disorders result in acellular capillaries secondary to ischemic death of retinal
vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and contractile pericytes. If acellular retinal blood vessels could be
regenerated with autologous or cell-banked self-renewing vascular-pericytic stem-progenitors, ischemia
could be relieved, and end stage blindness reversed or stabilized in these vasculopathies. Our group
established the feasibility of transplanting patient-specific embryonic vascular progenitors (VP) with
pericytic potential directly into the eye, following differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSC). We also established a novel tankyrase/PARP inhibitor-based small molecule cocktail for
reversion of conventional, lineage-primed hiPSC to ‘naïve’ hiPSCs (N-hiPSCs) that possessed a more
primitive epiblast state with higher functional pluripotency. The regenerative potential of naïve VP (N-VP)
differentiated from normal and diseased N-hiPSC was significantly more prolific relative to primed,
conventional hiPSC. For example, naive diabetic vascular progenitors (N-DVP) differentiated from
patient-specific naïve-reverted diabetic hiPSC (N-DhiPSC) possessed higher vascular functionality,
maintained greater genomic stability, harbored decreased lineage-primed gene expression, and were
more efficient in migrating to and re-vascularizing the deep neural layers of the ischemic retina than
isogenic diabetic vascular progenitors (DVP) from conventional, primed DhiPSC. In this proposal, we
develop the potential of N-VP for treatment of ischemic retinopathies. We will employ a humanized
animal model that mimics retinal ischemia [i.e., ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury] for testing the
therapeutic capacity of human N-DVP to form patent blood vessels, rescue ischemic retina, and improve
visual function. We will test the in vivo developmental potential of N-DVP to efficiently differentiate to
ECs and multipotent pericytic stem-progenitors following long-term engraftment in an ischemia-damaged
retinal niche. We will also aim to further improve our approach for generating unlimited amounts of
epigenetically-plastic, pristine, non-diseased naïve embryonic progenitors for cellular therapies by
probing how N-hiPSC reprogramming erases dysfunctional epigenetic donor cell memory and diabetes-
associated metabolic aberrations with greater efficiency than conventional hiPSC reprogramming. These
studies will outline a future pathway for the efficient synchronous generation of naïve vascular and
retinal stem-progenitors from the same N-hiPSC line for a more effective and comprehensive
regeneration of diseased retina. More broadly, we will develop the pre-clinical utility of this novel class of
human vascular-pericytic stem cells that possess high epigenetic plasticity, improved functionality, and
potentially high impact for ocular regenerative medicine."
10774237,"Summary Abstract
 The overall vision for our research is to discover novel mechanisms by which histone and non-histone
proteins on DNA, i.e. chromatin, regulate genomic processes and aging. In particular, we strive to integrate
different fields, such as the role of chromatin in genome stability and the role of chromatin in aging. Using a
combination of biochemistry, structural biology, molecular genetics in budding yeast, tissue culture and
genome-wide approaches, we have discovered that chromatin is disassembled and reassembled during not
only gene expression and DNA replication but also during DNA double-strand break repair. We have
revealed the mechanistic bases for these events and their key impact on these genomic processes. In more
recent years, we have expanded the questions that we address beyond chromatin – for example uncovering
novel mechanistic bases of aging and discovering new ways to extend lifespan. Similarly, inspired by our
recent finding that chromatin structure reduces the processing of DNA double-strand breaks to single-strand
DNA (termed DNA end resection), we have devised innovative CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA library screening
approaches to identify novel activities that regulate DNA end resection during DNA double-strand repair.
Most of the cells in the human body are in G0/G1-phase and it is critical that excessive DNA end resection
does not occur in these cells. If it were to occur, it would block DNA repair by the only pathway that is used to
repair DNA double-strand breaks in G0/G1-phase cells, namely non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and it
would result in translocations and deletions from the ensuing homology-mediated repair. Indeed, the extent
of DNA end resection is the critical decision point in the choice between using the NHEJ or homologous
recombination (HR) pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. We propose that mechanisms must be
in place that limit excessive DNA end resection in G0/G1-phase cells to prevent HR, yet enable sufficient DNA
end processing of un-ligatable DNA ends to allow NHEJ-mediated repair. The proteins and pathways that
regulate the extent of DNA end resection in G0/G1-phase cells are currently unknown. Thus, a major goal of
this program is to discover the machinery and mechanisms that regulate DNA end resection in G0/G1-phase
cells. We are uniquely positioned to do this, based on our expertise, novel genetic screening approach and
compelling preliminary data.
 Another critical, yet poorly understood, aspect of genome maintenance is how gene expression is
“shut-off” in the vicinity of a DNA lesion to prevent collisions between the transcription and DNA repair
machinery. Similarly, it is crucial that transcription is restarting after DNA double-strand break repair, but the
mechanism is unknown. We have recently discovered some of the proteins involved using our novel assays
and genetic screens, so the second major goal of this program is to discover the fundamental mechanisms of

Malaria is still responsible for an estimated 429,000 deaths and 212 million infections per year, the large majority
among young children. Individuals living in endemic regions gradually develop an immune response that protects
against symptomatic disease. Naturally acquired immunity targets the blood stage of the parasite’s life cycle and
is largely dependent on antibody reactivity. Elicitation of a similar immune response by vaccination in young,
non-immune children would dramatically reduce malaria morbidity and mortality. Various parasite antigens have
been associated with protection against clinical disease. Most of these antigens are expressed in the merozoite
stage and are involved in invasion of the red blood cell. However, vaccine trials based on these blood-stage
antigens have thus far been unsuccessful. One factor contributing to the failure of blood stage vaccines is the
extensive genetic diversity between different parasite strains that has resulted in strain-specific, but not strain-
transcending, antibody responses. Studies of naturally acquired immunity suggest that protected individuals
harbor antibodies against conserved epitopes. The identification of such conserved epitopes could serve as a
blueprint for structure-based design of a malaria blood stage vaccine. We hypothesize that immunity against
malaria is dependent on high affinity IgGs with cross-strain reactivity against merozoite antigens and
that these antibodies can be used to define conserved epitopes on merozoite vaccine candidates. To test
this hypothesis, we will compare the molecular and functional characteristics of antibodies directed against
merozoite antigens among immune adults, semi-immune children and non-immune children living in Tororo,
Uganda, a region with extremely high malaria transmission intensity, and use the most potent and broadly
reactive antibodies for epitope mapping. In Specific Aim 1, we will isolate merozoite antigen-specific memory B
cells from these individuals, test the ability of these antibodies to inhibit various malaria parasite strains in vitro,
and map the epitopes of cross-strain reactive antibodies to define conserved epitopes on merozoite antigens. In
Specific Aim 2, we will deep-sequence the memory B cell receptor repertoire to uncover the impact of life-long
malaria exposure on the humoral immune response, analyze the repertoire of anti-merozoite serum antibodies
and determine the cross-strain inhibitory activity and epitopes of dominant serum antibody clonotypes.
Collectively, the results from these experiments will provide detailed information about the types of antibodies
that a blood-stage vaccine should ideally elicit and will enable the design of novel immunogens to elicit strain-
transcending antibodies against the malaria blood stage. In addition, it will provide insight into the overlap and
differences between the memory B cell and serological compartments, and the selective mechanisms that drive
B cell differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells."

Obesity is a staggering public health threat associated with dysregulation of both long-acting homeostatic
feedback that modulates metabolism and satiety, and fast acting signals from the gut driving meal termination.
Excessive consumption of highly processed foods rich in sugar is increasingly implicated in the development of
obesity and its comorbidities. A major gap in our knowledge is to understand how carbohydrate-rich diets
modulate satiation via rapid gut-brain communication in normal weight and obese animals. Using a model I
pioneered to dissect the effects of gastrointestinal nutrient delivery on the in vivo dynamics of hypothalamic
feeding circuits, I previously showed that gastric infusion of macronutrients rapidly inhibits a population of hunger-
promoting neurons in the hypothalamus known as AgRP neurons. This inhibition is proportional to the total
number of calories infused and independent of macronutrient identity, though the molecular mechanisms are
macronutrient specific. More recent data show that obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) results in a selective
decrease in fat-mediated AgRP neuron inhibition, supporting the idea that over-nutrition induces nutrient-specific
changes along the gut-brain axis. However, the molecular mechanisms of AgRP neuron inhibition induced by
carbohydrate ingestion remain largely unknown.
The work proposed here will test several hypotheses to begin addressing this question. Aim 1 uses a combination
of pharmacologic and conditional genetic tools to define a role for rapid post-ingestive hormone release from a
specialized population of gastrointestinal tract-lining cells known as enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in driving
carbohydrate-mediated AgRP neuron inhibition. In addition to defining the specific secreted signals required for
glucose-induced gut-brain communication, we will determine in which tissues and cell types these hormones act
to elicit changes in neural activity. In Aim 2, based upon our results in mice fed a HFD, we will test the hypothesis
that obesity induced by high-carbohydrate diets results in unique changes in the dynamics of gut-brain
communication compared to HFD due to nutrient-specific changes in the transcriptional landscape of EECs.
These studies will close several gaps in our understanding of how carbohydrate intake rapidly modulates feeding
circuit activity. It will clarify the role of key glucose-released gut hormones in mediating these dynamics,
demonstrate where critical hormone signaling is required, and reveal how carbohydrate overconsumption
changes the gut-brain axis at the levels of both neural activity and EEC function. Collectively, the integration of
these data will significantly advance our understanding of how over-nutrition leads to nutrient-specific changes
in critical homeostatic processes. This will ultimately yield novel insights into the treatment and prevention of
obesity."
10760264,"ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated lung pressures,
right heart failure, and premature death. Current therapies fail to prevent disease progression due to their inability
to suppress and/or reverse pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) driven muscularization of distal
microvessels. The origin of these highly proliferative PASMCs remains incompletely understood, but may be
closely related to the maladaptive behavior of contiguous pericyte (PC) populations. In addition to providing
mural support to capillaries, PCs can differentiate into other cell types in response to stress. We recently reported
that human PAH lung PCs share lineage markers and functional properties with PASMCs, such as morphology
and contractility. We thus hypothesize that PASMCs in PAH vascular lesions originate from capillary PCs.
Fate-mapping of PCs in chronic hypoxia mice revealed that PCs dissociate from capillaries and relocate to
precapillary arterioles, where they co-express markers of mature SMCs and contribute to muscularization.
Through single cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis, we discovered that the HIF2A/SDF1 signaling pathway is a
master regulator of differentiation of PCs into SMC and a major modifier of PC dysfunction in PAH. We
propose to: 1) demonstrate that HIF2a/SDF1 activation causes PC dissociation from pulmonary capillaries, 2)
define the molecular mechanism by which HIF2a/SDF1 signaling drives PC differentiation into PASMC-like in
human and mice, and 3) determine whether manipulation of HIF2a/SDF1 in PCs can alter the severity of vascular
remodeling in animal models of PH. This project will provide novel insight into pericyte pathobiology and establish
HIF2a/SDF1 as a potential therapeutic target in PAH, for which the first drugs to reverse muscularization and
improve outcomes in PAH may be found."
10862574,"Hypertension affects over 85% of adults over 75 years of age and represents one of the few modifiable risk
factors to prevent dementia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older adults. However, current practice
guidelines for hypertension screening and treatment focus heavily on blood pressure (BP) measurements
obtained in clinic settings. This reliance on brick-and-mortar offices for BP measurement represents a significant
barrier for older adults, who often depend on others for transportation and who are at increased risk of severe
morbidity from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) has shown incredible promise for
more effective and timely BP treatment and control. Furthermore, the current pandemic has catalyzed
widespread adoption of HBPM for hypertension screening and management. However, evidence for this practice
is severely lacking in older adults. In fact, there are virtually no HBPM cohort studies in elderly populations in the
United States. This is particularly concerning as the discordance between clinic and home BP increases with
age, making older adults especially susceptible to harms from either overly aggressive or delayed BP treatment.
In this proposed study, we apply our unique expertise with HBPM and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring to one of the most long-standing and well-respected American cohorts of community-dwelling adults,
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). While ARIC already rigorously measures BP in the clinic
setting via automated devices, our proposal will additionally assess 8 days of HBPM and 24 hours of ambulatory
BP (once every 20 minutes) in 2,142 racially diverse adults over age 80 years, establishing possibly the largest
prospective study of home, ambulatory, and clinic-based BP measurement among older adults in the world. This
proposal is designed to directly inform clinical practice with HBPM by characterizing its measurement
performance (bias and variance), predictiveness with respect to key long-term events (dementia and CVD), and
interpretation (i.e. what a home BP measure equals in terms of BP measured by ABPM or in clinic).
The accomplishment of this proposal will address critical gaps in knowledge related to an increasingly utilized
form of BP measurement, improving access to timely hypertension care by establishing an efficient protocol for
precise BP measurement at home. Moreover, by investing in the digital monitoring platform of the ARIC study,
this proposal will lay the foundation for remote collection of a wide range of detailed, longitudinal, biosensor data
that can be leveraged by many investigators through subsequent ARIC proposals in years to come.
With current trends in BP control worsening among older adults in the United States, there has never been a
greater need for research on innovative technologies to improve access to high quality BP measurement.
Ultimately, our proposal directly answers the call by NHLBI's 2017 expert panel on BP measurement for high
impact research that determines “the role of ABPM and HBPM in the diagnosis…of hypertension” and “the
optimal protocol for using HBPM…to diagnose and assess…hypertension.”"
10786115,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are lipid mediators with beneficial effects on metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) health. EETs and other FFA epoxides are quickly metabolized to biologically less active diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Inhibition of sEH, which increases EETs, improves metabolic and CV health and is proposed as an effective strategy to treat diabetes and CV diseases. Despite its importance to health, how sEH is regulated in vivo is poorly understood, particularly in humans where sEH is difficult to study, largely due to limited access to individual tissues where sEH is expressed or lack of appropriate tools to assess sEH activity. sEH activity is often inferred in human studies by measuring FFA epoxide-diol ratios in the blood. As many as 15 FFA epoxide-diol pairs can be measured in blood. We recently developed a new method to estimate sEH activity in vivo, which combines metabolomic determination and simultaneous analysis of all measurable epoxide-diol pairs. This method⎯Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Indices (SAMI)⎯markedly increases the power to detect changes (or group differences) in sEH activity. This is important, especially in human studies, as increased power allows detection of treatment effects with smaller sample sizes, reducing cost. One objective of this proposal is to evaluate the performance of our new metabolomic approach, SAMI, in detecting changes in sEH activity or EET metabolism under various conditions in animals, before it can be widely applied to human studies. Using SAMI, our recent study showed that sEH activity decreased profoundly after a meal in rats. Interestingly, this effect was completely abolished in animals with gut bacteria depleted by antibiotic treatment, suggesting that gut bacteria may be involved in the postprandial effect. Our preliminary data suggest the intriguing possibility that lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid produced by gut bacteria, may be an endogenous inhibitor of sEH, mediating the postprandial regulation of sEH activity. Another objective of this proposal is to validate this novel mechanism of postprandial sEH regulation involving LCA. Thus, the proposed studies will explore a novel mechanism for sEH regulation in vivo and evaluate the performance of our new method to assess sEH activity based on plasma oxylipins. Successful completion of the proposed studies would facilitate studies of sEH regulation in vivo in animals and humans and lead to new therapeutic targets or strategies in the treatment of diabetes or CV diseases."

Dr. Jonathan Santoro is a clinician-scientist focused on exploring the interface between vascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and inflammation in persons with Down syndrome (DS). This five-year
mentored career development award will provide him with advanced training and skills in population-based
data analysis, biostatistics, neuroimaging, and clinical trials development to ensure a successful transition to
an independent research career. The outlined proposal builds on previously published work by Dr. Santoro and
leverages a mentorship team of experts in DS, neurodevelopment, vascular disease, and cerebrovascular-
inflammatory disorders in persons with DS at his home institution and other large academic DS centers.
Research Context: Persons with DS have an increased risk of early CeVD, specifically moyamoya syndrome,
and the initial presentation is often irreversible neurologic insult secondary to cerebrovascular accident. For
persons with DS, there exists no validated means of assessing risk for CeVD. This K23 career development
builds on previous work by Dr. Santoro who identified non-invasive ways to screen for CeVD in children with
DS. This study will prospectively asses blood pressure (BP) in persons with DS and subsequently use this to
predict pre-symptomatic CeVD (Aim 1). Next, this study will compare gold standard CeVD neuroimaging
studies to various non-invasive, low-cost, biometric tools such as repeated BP measurements, transcranial
Doppler ultrasound and neurocognitive testing to assess internal and predictive validity of these measures in
the prediction of CeVD (Aim 2). As persons with DS are established to have immune dysregulation and
systemic inflammatory profiles, we will also explore the role of systemic and vascular inflammatory biomarkers
in the development of CeVD with the goal of identifying contributory inflammatory cascades that could be
targeted with therapeutic interventions geared towards preventing CeVD in subsequent studies (Aim 3).
Career Development Plan: Dr. Santoro will complete coursework in healthcare and science communication,
data analysis, epidemiology, clinical trial design and biomedical informatics. This plan also will strengthen his
competence in both bioinformatics and neuroimaging and be supplemented by institutional workshops and
seminars. This experiential learning is designed to promote knowledge and skillset development needed to
both execute his research and ensure that skills are developed for his transition to an independent researcher.
Dr. Santoro’s career development goals will be supported through close mentorship by an experienced and
committed interdisciplinary team and a combination of didactic, experiential, and team-based learning. This
proposal and subsequent R01 proposals seek to improve the neurologic care of young persons with DS."

The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in
cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to
immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious
challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological
activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can
obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment
heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to
accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems.
We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular
content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the
most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of
the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image-
localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our
understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology
and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the
radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for
prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal
relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the
radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making."
10807011,"Project Summary/Abstract
We have previously shown that a mild reduction in food intake strongly inhibits progression of polycystic kidney
disease (PKD) in an orthologous mouse model but we did not understand the mechanism. Now, we discovered
that the metabolic state of ketosis is important, not caloric restriction per se. Dietary interventions leading to
ketosis profoundly inhibit - and even reverse - PKD progression in orthologous and non-ortholgous mouse, rat
and feline models of PKD. Remarkably, treatment with the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) alone is almost
100% effective in preventing PKD progression. Preliminary results suggest that BHB acts on PKD kidneys via
its receptor GPR109a, a GPCR that suppresses cAMP signaling. Our results suggest that cyst cells in PKD are
metabolically in?exible, depend on glucose and are unable to shift to utilizing fatty acids and ketone bodies.
The main thrust of this proposal is to generate compelling results to justify clinical trials to investigate the
ef?cacy of dietary interventions and/or BHB supplementation in ADPKD, and to inform the design of such trials.
The main signi?cance of this proposal is the enormous potential for clinical translation. Dietary interventions to
induce ketosis are well-established. Because dietary interventions frequently fail in clinical practice due to poor
adherence, our ?nding that BHB (an FDA-classi?ed dietary supplement) has a dominant bene?cial effect could
rapidly lead to a highly feasible therapy. To achieve our goals, we will treat rodent and feline models of PKD,
with dietary interventions to induce ketosis (time-restricted feeding or ketogenic diets) or mimic ketosis by
supplementation with BHB. Ef?cacy on parameters of PKD progression and effects on molecular mechanisms
will be assessed. To determine whether BHB acts via GPR109a, we have crossed Gpr109a-/- mice with fast-
and slowly-progressing Pkd1 mouse models. We will test whether Gpr109a knock-out affects disease
progression and prevents the ef?cacy of ketogenic dietary intervention or BHB. Successful completion of the
proposed work could lead to a disruptive change in ADPKD therapy by utilizing dietary interventions and/or
dietary supplements without the need for pharmacological intervention."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the highest patient death rate of all breast cancer subtypes. Several
molecular targets have been identified for breast cancer treatment, but currently, there is no approved,
broadly applicable targeted therapy for TNBC. Through 10 years of research, we found that elongation factor
2-kinase (EF2K) expression is a critical driver of TNBC tumorigenesis and progression. We also found that
microRNA-22 (miR-22) expression is broadly repressed in TNBC patients, and is inversely correlated with EF2K
expression. Further analysis revealed that miR-22 suppresses tumors by specifically binding to EF2K, which
inhibits EF2K expression and reduces tumor growth in multiple TNBC models. Considering the clinical
significance and potential therapeutic value of EF2K in TNBC, we have thus developed an AXL receptor-targeted
AXL aptamer-coated SLNP-miR-22 nanoparticle system that can specifically deliver miR-22 to TNBC tumors in
vivo (but does not lead to miR-22 accumulation in normal tissues).
On the basis of this preliminary work, we hypothesize that EF2K is an effective therapeutic target in TNBC, and
that targeting EF2K using our AXL-aptamer-SLNP-miR-22 nanotherapeutics can provide significant therapeutic
efficacy in TNBC treatment. However, understandably, this therapeutic system is complex, and it has been
difficult to further understand the underlying biological and physical processes that significantly impact
treatment outcome, and to identify the optimal doses and dosing schedules for maximizing treatment
efficacy. Therefore, in this project, we propose to overcome this challenge by integrating biological experiments
with mathematical modeling based on the underlying biological and physical mechanisms that are involved in
cancer invasion, drug penetration, and drug-cancer cell interactions in the EF2K-targeted miR-22
nanotherapeutics for TNBC treatment. Our hypothesis will be tested by achieving the following two specific aims:
1) experimental testing of the EF2K-targeted miR-22 nanotherapy (Aim 1), and 2) mathematical modeling (Aim
2). In Aim 1, we will focus on characterizing and determining the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of EF2K-targeted
miR-22 mediated therapies in orthotopic mouse models. In Aim 2, we will focus on developing, testing, and
validating a mathematical model of EF2K-targeted, miR-22 based nanotherapy, using a logically integrated
statistical and multiscale mechanistic modeling approach. Experimental data from Aim 1 will be supplied to Aim
2 for developing and validating the mathematical model, and experiments in Aim 1 will be guided by discoveries
obtained from computational investigations in Aim 2. Through this iteration-based feedback approach, the
mathematical model will be used to predict and determine the effects of various parameters, including siRNA
dose and dosing schedules, on tumor response to EF2K-targeted miR-22 mediated therapies (with or without
chemotherapy), and to determine the optimal drug doses and dosing schedules for optimizing therapeutic
efficacy. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate that this miR-22-based nanotherapy is safe and
effective, both alone and in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents as a co-adjuvant therapy, and
to complete preclinical development for potential future clinical translation for TNBC patients."
10809607,"ABSTRACT. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and molecular PET biomarkers of Aβ and phospho-tau
combined with MRI assessment of global and regional neurodegeneration led to the development of the “A/T/N”
classification scheme for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that was intended to add precision to the diagnosis for clinical
purposes, therapeutic trials and regulatory agencies. For observational epidemiological research the widespread
use of these types of biomarkers is not possible because of the expense and limited access to cyclotrons
necessary for molecular imaging and the difficulty in obtaining CSF in large studies. Further, it is clear that the
relationship of biomarker values to clinical diagnoses can also differ by age, sex and race/ethnic group, and few
studies have included diverse cohorts, representative of the population in the US. The advent of newly-
established, blood-based biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, p-tau217, neurofilament light chain or NFL) combined with
brain MRI provides an opportunity to investigate the application of “A/T/N biomarker profile” in community-based,
observational study, and create endophenotypes that can be used to identify genetic susceptibility.
The Washington Heights, Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) study is one of the few cohorts where the
newly established blood-based biomarkers and well-established neuroimaging biomarkers for AD can be used
to investigate a blood-based “A/T/N biomarker profile” across race/ethnic groups and by age and sex. Amyloid
(plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42), Tau (plasma total tau and p-tau217), and Neurodegeneration (plasma neurofilament
light [NfL], and MRI (brain volumes and cortical thickness) will be assessed in a longitudinal, multi-ethnic
community-based elderly cohort (24% white non-Hispanic, 28% African American, 48% Caribbean Hispanic).
The cohort has been genetically characterized, and has stored DNA, sera, and plasma. The effects of
cerebrovascular disease “V” and psychosocial factors will also be investigated as potential modulators of the
“A/T/N biomarker profile”. We will use publicly available genetic data in African American, Caribbean Hispanic
and non-Hispanic white participants that included the WHICAP cohort to create ethnic-specific polygenic risk
scores (ePRS). This will allow the identification of variants associated with the endophenotypes underlying the
“A/T/N biomarker profile” and augment the ePRS association with the clinical diagnoses of AD.
We will maintain longitudinal follow-up of the WHICAP cohort, adding participants only to account for attrition,
collecting whole blood for plasma and sera, ascertaining psychosocial and biomedical risk and protective factors
and obtaining structural MRI measures at least twice in participants over a four-year period. The overall goals of
this project are to: 1) investigate variability in blood-based biomarkers and MRI measures in the “A/T/N biomarker
profile” as it applies to clinical diagnoses in a multi-ethnic cohort; 2) investigate blood-based biomarkers as
endophenotypes in genetic analyses for earlier detection and diagnosis of AD; 3) investigate how
cerebrovascular disease and psychosocial factors modulate the use of blood-based and MRI biomarkers."
10789987,"Our preliminary studies have identified a novel stomach-liver humoral axis. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the gastric X/A like cells coordinates nutrient availability with the hepatic lipid metabolism via ghrelin. Our studies have also identified ETV5, an ETS-related transcriptional factor, as the novel downstream target of mTOR signaling. Further, ETV5 alters the expression of ghrelin O-acyltransferase and subsequent acylation of ghrelin. Although X/A like cells in the stomach produce and secrete both acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin, only acyl-ghrelin binds and activates its receptor: growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a). Acyl-ghrelin was originally demonstrated to act via the hypothalamus to stimulate food intake. Our data now indicate that acyl-ghrelin regulates hepatic lipid synthesis via its direct action on hepatocytes. We thus propose four aims to investigate the functions of gastric mTOR-ETV5 signaling pathway in the production and secretion of acyl-ghrelin and its effects on hepatic lipid metabolism. Aim 1 will establish ETV5 as the downstream target of mTOR, mediating its unique regulation of ghrelin acylation in X/A like cells. Aim 2, using transgenic mice in which mTOR signaling in gastric X/A like cells is either activated or suppressed, will demonstrate that gastric mTOR signaling affects hepatic lipid metabolism and the development of hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Aim 3 will examine whether ETV5 in gastric X/A like cells alters hepatic lipid metabolism and the development of hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet, using mice in which ETV5 gene expression in gastric X/A like cells is altered. Aim 4 will determine whether acyl-ghrelin mediates the effects of gastric mTOR on hepatic lipid metabolism via its activation of GHSR1a on hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and/or hypothalamic (HTH) neurons. We will use cell biological and transgenic techniques to achieve these goals. Completion of this proposal will advance a completely new therapeutic approach for NAFLD, one directed at gastric sites."
10792636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on vulnerable populations with serious comorbid
medical conditions. Individuals with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) are among those most strongly
affected by disruptions in care and are also highly susceptible to poor outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection. It is critical to understand how to effectively manage these patients during the course of the pandemic.
The rising prevalence of cirrhosis, an end-stage of CLD, is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in
the United States and alcohol use is a major risk factor. Thus, effective intervention for alcohol cessation is a
high-priority need. In addition, high quality advanced CLD with adherence to known quality indicators is
associated with positive patient outcomes, critical to enhanced survival, and quality of life. Vulnerable populations
including veterans and those receiving care in safety net systems are at significant risk for liver and COVID-19
related health disparities. They also have known barriers to healthcare access and are at high risk for
disengagement from care. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the traditional health care
delivery models, but the impact on outcomes of vulnerable patients with advanced CLD is currently unknown.
Moreover, the widespread use of telemedicine as a mitigation strategy within these health systems due to
COVID-19 has provided an unprecedented opportunity for evaluation and innovation of care delivery models.
Better understanding of patients' experience with telemedicine and impact on their outcomes is urgently needed
to establish processes and polices that ensure equity in access, sustainability, and high-quality care delivery.
To address these critical issues, we propose to evaluate the care of patients with advanced CLD during the
pandemic within hepatology practices in two generalizable health systems serving vulnerable populations, a
public safety net system and Veterans Affairs healthcare systems. Furthermore, we will examine the efficacy of
a stepped care intervention (i.e., motivational interviewing and addiction physician management) via
telemedicine to treat alcohol use as an adjunct to usual hepatology care. We will also examine COVID-19
outcomes. We propose the following aims: 1) Evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical
outcomes of vulnerable patients with advanced CLD receiving care in hepatology practices, in a natural
experiment; 2) Evaluate patient-reported experiences with use of telemedicine in response to the pandemic to
deliver hepatology specialty care in those with advanced CLD; and 3) Conduct a randomized controlled trial
evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of a stepped alcohol treatment using telemedicine on unhealthy alcohol
use in patients with alcohol-related CLD receiving care in hepatology practices, compared with usual care. We
hypothesize that we will observe an increase in adverse patient outcomes in the post-pandemic period, that the
patient experience and satisfaction with telemedicine as a mitigation strategy to reduce COVID-19 risk will
improve, and that patients receiving stepped care will be more likely to reduce or abstain from alcohol use.

10579556,"Inflammation and sepsis are characterized by dysregulated host responses that span hemostatic, inflammatory,
and immune continuums. Thrombosis is a common complication of sepsis, contributing to adverse outcomes
including organ failure and death. The significance of these dysregulated host responses is demonstrated by
studies suggesting half of all hospital deaths, including Veterans, may be attributed to sepsis. Sepsis also
increases the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, and causes substantial morbidity among
Veteran patients. Established and emerging evidence supports the concept that dysregulated platelet responses
mediate thrombotic events during inflammation, including sepsis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms and
functional consequences of dysregulated platelet functions during sepsis remain incompletely understood. Our
proposal, entitled “Platelet Reprograming During Inflammation” will identify new pathways by which interferon
alpha (IFN), which is systemically increased during sepsis, regulates the loading, trafficking, and secretion of
cargo proteins in platelets and their parent cell, megakaryocytes (MKs). We have identified that the expression
of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is robustly induced in platelets and MKs during
inflammatory stress. Our preliminary data also suggest that increased IFITM3 in platelets regulates the secretion
of cargo proteins to promote a thrombo-inflammatory milieu. In this proposal, we will perform complementary
clinical, ex vivo, and in vivo studies to determine how IFITM3 governs cargo loading, trafficking, and secretion in
platelets and MKs during inflammation. In specific aim 1, we will determine whether or not IFITM3 regulates
cargo granule secretion during inflammation and identify proteins that IFITM3 interacts with. We will also examine
the effects of a naturally-occurring, loss of function mutation in IFITM3 on secretion. In specific aim 2, we will use
complementary pharmacologic and genetic toolsets to determine if IFITM3 regulates cargo loading and
trafficking in platelet granules during inflammation. In specific aim 3, we will establish how IFITM3 participates in
inflammatory and thrombotic host responses during sepsis. These studies are innovative as IFITM3 has not
previously been identified as a regulator of cargo movement within platelets and MKs, or any other cell
for that matter. Regulated cargo movement is critical for proper cell functions and disrupted cargo
movement contributes to inflammation and thrombosis in many diseases. This work will therefore test an
important functional hypothesis and elucidate completely new pathophysiologic mechanisms of thrombosis
during inflammation and sepsis. This proposal will help us understand how interferons contribute to
sepsis-associated thrombosis (a disease affecting thousands of Veterans each year), and may elucidate
new therapeutic avenues to prevent these thrombotic complications. Discoveries made may also help
us understand the basis for thrombosis that occurs in other thrombo-inflammatory diseases affecting
Veterans (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, others). Findings generated from our studies will also likely
have relevance across other cell types, as IFITM3 is ubiquitously expressed and regulated cargo movement is
critical for the function of most human cells."
10758245,"Emerging adulthood represents a uniquely sensitive period for studying social determinants of health in the
United States (US), as young people begin to establish their own paths towards higher education, careers, and
financial independence. College, specifically, is a time of changing socioeconomic position (SEP) that is not
often clearly captured in health research, despite strong ties between SEP and health. Over 40% of all young
adults aged 18-24 are enrolled as full-time college students in the US, and they increasingly represent the
diversity of the country in terms of SEP, race, and ethnicity, particularly colleges classified as Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs). (The 539 HSIs in the US serve over two-thirds of all Latinx, 40% of all Asian, and 22% of all
Black college students in the US.) Despite perceptions that emerging adult college students are at the peak of
health, over one-third of college students report being overweight or obese, and the incidence of
cardiovascular disease outcomes among young adults has been an increasing cause of concern. This risk is
exacerbated for low-SEP students, and students of color, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Therefore, emerging adult college students are a priority population to promote cardiovascular health, and
reduce health disparities, before the onset of chronic disease. The proposed longitudinal research addresses
these important scientific gaps by creating and studying a de novo, longitudinal cohort of 4,000 racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adult college students recruited as first-year students from two
HSIs in California and followed over three years, including if they leave college. The study will incorporate
anthropometric, institutional administrative, smartphone, behavioral, and self-reported data. The specific aims
are: (1) To determine the contribution of emerging adults’ economic stressors (e.g.,income, wealth, financial
stress, basic needs, residential environment, subjective social status) to cardiometabolic health outcomes
(e.g., weight-related measures, blood pressure) over time; (2) To determine the contribution of educational
protective factors (e.g., use of social supports, academic supports, basic needs supports) to cardiometabolic
health outcomes over time; (3) examine weight-related behaviors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, diet, disordered
eating, smoking) as mechanisms of associations between economic stress, educational protective factors, and
cardiometabolic health. This large, diverse sample will have sufficient statistical power to examine how
racialized and gendered identities may modify associations between economic and educational exposures and
cardiometabolic outcomes, which will help increase understanding of the complex interplay between different
social determinants of health and help inform potential interventions to reduce health disparities. Identifying risk
and protective factors that could affect weight and blood pressure among diverse emerging adult college
students can help inform novel interventions and support services to promote cardiometabolic health in a
significant portion of the young adult population."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is currently the third most lethal cancer in the United States. It is
currently the third leading of cancer-related deaths in the United States and by the end of this decade,
pancreatic cancer is predicted to pass colorectal cancer, making it the second most lethal cancer in the USA,
second only to lung cancer. The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer is in part due to the late-stage diagnosis.
Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer typically succumb to the disease within a year or less of initial
diagnosis. New incidence and death rates from pancreatic cancer are almost identical, emphasizing the fact
that nearly all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer will eventually die of the disease. Therefore,
developing strategies to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer is critical. In
mice, pancreatic cancer precursor lesions – pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms or PanINs are preceded by
the process of acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM). microRNA (miRNA) is a class of small noncoding RNAs that
epigenetically regulate these processes. Our previous studies suggest the tumor suppression role of miRNAs
encoded within the MIR217 host gene, i.e. miR-216a, -216b, and -217. These miRNAs are pancreas enriched
with predominate expression in pancreatic acini but are reduced during the pre-malignant stages (ADM and
PanIN) and in PDAC. Based on these discoveries, we hypothesize that restoration of miR-216a to the
pancreas through an acinar cell-targeting nanoparticles (NPs) can shift the early-stage cancer lesion to
the acinar state, reducing PanIN and PDAC formation. To test our hypothesis, we will optimize the
nanoparticle formulation for efficient miRNA delivery to acinar cells by screening a library of dendrimer-lipid
nanoparticles (DLNPs) formulations for high delivery potency, low toxicity, and low immunogenicity. The ability
of NP-formulated miR-216a and NPs per se to inhibit in vitro ADM will be studied on an in vitro 3-D assay.
DLNPs will be engineered to target glycoprotein 2 (GP2) a cell surface marker that is exclusively expressed by
normal acinar cells and those acinar cells undergoing ADM. miR-216a oligos formulated into anti-GP2 DLNPs
will be evaluated for maximally tolerated dose, toxicity, biodistribution, and efficacy.
The majority of therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer are focused on late-stage treatment, however,
early preventative therapeutics that may improve the clinical outcomes of PDAC patients have not been
investigated. We investigate the potential of nanotherapeutics to target pancreatic acinar cells early before the
onset of PDAC. If implemented into the clinic, this therapy will allow individuals with high risk of pancreatic
cancer, as identified through a biomarker, to receive administration of treatment options at an earlier stage,
leading to better clinical outcomes."
10771272,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
We have developed methods to profile the metabolome of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and other rare cell
types purified from tissues. Each hematopoietic cell type had a distinct metabolite identity. Most metabolites
were enriched or depleted in specific cell types, suggesting they may have novel cell-type specific roles. HSCs
and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) in mouse and human bone marrow had high levels of ascorbate (Vitamin
C), which promoted the activity of the enzyme TET2, a suppressor of HSC function. Hematopoietic-specific
ascorbate deficiency promoted HSC function, myelopoiesis and the generation of inflammatory myeloid cells,
and caused early lethality. Ascorbate deficiency is common in the human population because in early primate
evolution we lost the ability to synthesize ascorbate. Ascorbate deficiency in healthy people is associated with
increased risk of mortality for unknown reasons. Hematopoietic TET2 loss of function mutations are also
common in humans, and drive a clonal expansion of mutant blood cells termed clonal hematopoiesis. TET2-
deficient blood cells may contribute to an increased risk of mortality. This application’s objective is to
understand the role of ascorbate in the regulation of myelopoiesis. Our central hypothesis is that ascorbate
suppresses myelopoiesis, and that ascorbate deficiency increases myelopoiesis and inflammation after
plasmodium infection. To test this hypothesis, we will use genetically engineered ascorbate deficient mice, to
mimic the human condition, and Tet2-deficient mice. In Aim 1 we will test if ascorbate suppresses the
generation of inflammatory myeloid cells by acting on HSCs or restricted myeloid progenitors, and if this is
mediated by Tet2. In Aim 2 we will determine the effects of ascorbate deficiency or Tet2 deficiency on the
myelopoietic response to Plasmodium infection in a mouse model of malaria. In Aim 3 we will investigate the
mechanisms by which ascorbate deficiency and Tet2 deficiency promote morbidity and mortality in
Plasmodium infection. These experiments may have significant public health implications. They could identify
physiological situations, such as infection, in which the presence of ascorbate deficiency and Tet2-deficient
clonal hematopoiesis are deleterious to the organism. They may also identify mechanisms by which aberrant
myelopoiesis contributes to the pathogenesis of malaria which afflicts more than 200 million people worldwide."

Mucous metaplasia is commonly associated with morbidity and mortality in multiple lung diseases including
fibrosis, COPD and asthma. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to mucous metaplasia in
these diseases remain largely unknown. Recent lineage tracing data suggest that club cells are the cell of origin
for metaplastic mucous epithelium. However, the club cell is a heterogenous population, and it remains unknown
which club cell subpopulation(s) contribute to mucous metaplasia. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms leading
to mucous cell differentiation are largely undetermined. We aim to address these outstanding issues in this
proposal. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified three club cell subpopulations, two of which are
characterized by the expression of VEGF receptor 2 (also known as Flk1 or Kdr). Significantly, deletion of Kdr
leads to mucous metaplasia of the intrapulmonary airway epithelium at the early postnatal stage. Furthermore,
transiently increased Kdr is required for blocking mucous metaplasia during airway regeneration following
naphthalene challenge. Loss of epithelial Kdr or a hypomorphic mutation for the ligand Vegfa leads to abundant
mucous cells expressing Sox9 which has been shown to regulate mucous cell differentiation in the intestine.
Importantly, mucous metaplasia is also associated with reduced Kdr expression accompanied by increased
SOX9 protein levels in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic lungs. We therefore hypothesize that Vegf/Kdr
signaling is a gatekeeper blocking mucous differentiation of club cell subpopulations during airway
regeneration, and that suppressed Kdr promotes mucous metaplasia via Sox9 during asthma
pathogenesis. We formulate three specific aims to test the hypothesis. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that
epithelial Kdr blocks club cell differentiation into mucous cells via Erk signaling. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis
that Vegfa/Kdr signaling blocks mucous metaplasia of club cell subpopulations. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis
that Vegfa/Kdr signaling blocks mucous metaplasia via inhibition of Sox9. Findings from these studies will
provide critical insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern normal mucous cell differentiation
and how the mechanism goes awry, leading to mucous metaplasia. Our study will also provide potential
therapeutic targets for this common pathological entity."

A substantial proportion of postnatal health, including childhood obesity and metabolic disease, is programmed
in utero during fetal development. While birthweight has been linked to these outcomes, it may be only a proxy
reflecting a complex interplay of genetics and environment that defines a common etiology between birthweight
and later life health, and which defines the Developmental Origins of Heath and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis.
Supporting this hypothesis are a number of large, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have
identified genetic variants associated with early life outcomes, such as birthweight and childhood obesity, body
mass index and adiposity, and have demonstrated that these same variants can also impact adult
cardiovascular traits and disease. Thus, early intervention, either through identifying at-risk population and/or
targeting functional variations induced by genetic and environmental factors, could be highly effective in
reducing overall disease burden. Our team spearheaded the placental research suggesting that the placenta
may be the critical organ for much of childhood health programming. This proposal is framed on the
hypothesis that the functional genome of a placenta acts as a critical and unique mediator of the in utero
environment (both genetic and non-genetic) to influence birthweight and program postnatal growth and
development, and such effects may occur in particular cellular components of the placenta. Leveraging the
resources of three well-characterized and diverse birth cohorts in the US, we propose a rigorous integrative
genomics and systems biology investigation to demonstrate the causal, mechanistic role of the placenta in
postnatal health programming using state-of-the-art, post-GWAS, functional genomic investigations, including
innovative use of single-nucleus RNA sequencing technology and molecular quantitative trait loci analyses
(molQTL). We will build a comprehensive molecular atlas of human term placenta to identify functional
molecular features that mediate birthweight GWAS hits as well as those independent of genetics, and we will
build a placental transcriptomic atlas at cellular resolution to improve mechanistic understanding of the role of
the placenta at the single cell level. Furthermore, we will examine prospective associations of the birthweight-
related molecular features in placenta with growth trajectory, childhood obesity, BMI, and adiposity at age 5 as
a model of the placenta’s role in long-term health programming. This project aligns with the research priorities
of Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch of the NICHD, in defining “molecular biology processes involved in
normal and abnormal placentation” as well as “genetic and epigenetic factors that adversely affect pregnancy
outcomes”. Results from our study will pave the way for the development of placenta-based biomarkers to be
assessed at birth for prospective risk stratification into childhood so early intervention may be implemented;
they will also help identify mechanistic pathways useful in defining prevention or intervention strategies to
alleviate long-term disease burden."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and debilitating disease characterized by deterioration of articular cartilage
and pathologic changes to other tissues leading to joint stiffness and pain. Non-surgical treatments focus on
behavior modifications and pain relief, but little is known about the molecular pathways controlling nociception
during OA pathogenesis. In this project, we will examine how controlling the activity of PHLPP phosphatases
contributes to joint innervation in vivo and neurite extension in vitro.
We identified PHLPPs as suppressors of chondrocyte regeneration and pain-related behaviors. PHLPP1 and
PHLPP2 are present in human and mouse sensory neurons and abnormally expressed in human OA cartilage.
In an animal model of OA, intra-articular injection of PHLPP inhibitors prevented joint hypersensitivity and
cartilage degradation and reduced sensory neuron innervation of joint tissues (e.g., subchondral bone,
periosteum). PHLPP inhibitors suppressed outgrowth of small/medium sensory neurons and expression of
neurotransmitters and neurofilaments in vitro. The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms by
which small molecule inhibitors of PHLPP phosphatases suppress OA-associated pain. The central
hypothesis is that PHLPP inhibitors prevent innervation of osteoarthritic joints and alter molecular pathways
controlling sensory neurite extension. We will study mechanisms by which PHLPP inhibitors prevent neurite
extension and joint pain after knee injury with sensitive murine reporters of innervation and with human iPSC-
derived sensory neuron model systems."

This proposed renewal of “Purinergic modulation of the autoimmune vascular phenotype” builds upon 4 years
of discovery by an early stage investigator in the areas of lupus, COVID-19, and antiphospholipid syndrome
(APS). Despite the routine use of traditional anticoagulants in the latter disease, 1 in 5 APS patients is still
expected to experience a breakthrough thrombotic event. Furthermore, anticoagulants do little to mitigate the
chronic occlusive microangiopathy that damages APS organs over time. How to combat anticoagulant-
resistant manifestations of APS is unknown. This project now endeavors to use a deeply-phenotyped patient
cohort, selected in vitro systems, and the most relevant animal models to identify adjuvant therapeutic
approaches for the APS clinic. Its successful completion will shed additional light on neutrophil phenotypes in
APS and will provide a new understanding of the role that purinergic signaling, neutrophil-platelet interactions,
and neutrophil metabolism play in thrombotic events. The goal is that by the next cycle of this grant, we will
have identified the 1-2 most promising drug candidates for repurposing in our APS clinic.
APS is a leading acquired cause of both thrombosis and late-term pregnancy loss. In pursuit of a mechanistic
understanding of immunothrombosis in APS, our group was the first to show that neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs, tangles of chromatin and microbicidal proteins expelled from activated neutrophils via “NETosis”) are
required for APS-associated thrombosis. Since our last competitive submission, we have found that
extracellular adenosine generated by the ectonucleotidase CD73 restrains NET release by activating surface
adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) and thereby boosting intracellular cAMP. Key preliminary data that inform this
renewal demonstrate (i) restraint of platelet-mediated neutrophil activation by the CD73-A2AR axis; (ii)
exaggerated thrombosis in myeloid lineage-specific A2AR knockout mice; (iii) hyperactive glucose metabolism
in APS neutrophils that normalizes with A2AR agonists; and (iv) mitigation of thrombosis in APS mice by
metabolism-focused interventions. The hypothesis is that manipulation of the CD73-A2AR-cAMP axis will
restore neutrophil homeostasis in APS. Specific Aim 1 will define mechanisms by which purinergic signaling
influences neutrophil and platelet function in APS. This Aim will define for the first time the purinergic
landscape of a thrombophilic disorder, elucidate mechanisms by which purinergic signaling regulates
neutrophil-platelet communication, and potentially identify the subset of APS patients most likely to benefit from
antiplatelet and/or adenosine receptor-modulating therapies. Specific Aim 2 will determine the extent to which
purinergic signaling can be leveraged to normalize neutrophil metabolism in APS. This Aim is expected to
provide a new understanding of the metabolic requirements of NETosis, elucidate strategies for manipulating
neutrophil metabolism, and identify the subset of APS patients most likely to benefit from those strategies."

 A fundamental goal of neuroimaging is to discern, differentiate and quantitate: demyelination,
remyelination, axonal injury and axonal loss in the central nervous system (CNS) disorders. For instance,
multifocal lesions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that frequently effect CNS white-matter (WM), exhibit both
demyelination and axonal loss. Demyelination and axonal loss result in disability impacting physical and
mental health. Thus, quantification of demyelination, axonal injury and remyelination in the CNS will be a major
step forward for early detection, monitoring of disease activity and importantly for clinical studies of potential
neuroprotective and remyelinating therapies. Despite significant advances in MRI technology, these goals have
not been fully achieved.
 Among the emerging advanced MRI methods for studying cervical spinal cord (CSC) WMs, DTI has been
the most extensively studied. The conventional DTI metrics are affected to a greater degree by edema than by
demyelination. This is because the signal change in routine low-b diffusion methods is dominated by water
movement in extra-cellular space. From our extensive experience with DTI of CSC, we surmised that a
modified approach with improved quantitation and reproducibility would be required. Therefore, we have
developed a novel DTI method called ultrahigh-b Diffusion-Weighted MRI (UHb-DWI) that promises to
distinguish demyelination, inflammation, and axonal injury in CNS. UHb-DWI takes advantage of known fiber
direction, which makes data acquisition and signal processing significantly simple compared with the
conventional DTI.
 As the UHb-DWI is matured to quantification of myelination in CSC white-matters, we plan to expand UHb-
DWI to detect demyelination, remyelination, and axonal injury in other white-matter tracts in CNS, including
anterior optic nerves, brainstem, cervical spinal cord, and corpus callosum. Therefore, the goals of this study
are to: (a) correlate biomarkers measured with UHb-DWI with demyelination and axonal loss in an animal
model of cord injury, (b) establish a reference library of healthy human CNS data in eight age/gender groups,
and (c) acquire exploratory data on limited cohorts of patients with clinically isolated syndrome and optic
neuritis to establish proof of concept for human applications.
 Upon successful completion of current work, we will have a powerful, non-invasive imaging method to
characterize axonal density and demyelination in patients’ CNS. This may lead to earlier and more sensitive
detection of clinically important spinal cord lesions or the ability to monitor the evolution of the cord during the
treatment of patients with MS and other major CNS diseases including Neuromyelitis Optica, Optic Neuritis,
Traumatic Brain Injury, Alzheimer’s Disease, and degenerative cervical myelopathy."

Nuclear envelope proteins are essential for maintaining nuclear architecture, gene expression and chromatin
organization. Mutations in nuclear envelope proteins and nuclear lamins cause numerous human diseases,
many of which involve in skeletal muscle defects such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Although
the genetic mutations responsible for these diseases are known, the molecular mechanisms whereby
perturbations in the nuclear envelope cause disease are still not well understood. Moreover, it is still unclear why
mutations in ubiquitously expressed nuclear envelope proteins lead to tissue-specific pathogenesis such as
striated muscle-specific defects. Our lab recently showed that the nuclear envelope transmembrane protein 39
(NET39) is a muscle-specific regulator of nuclear envelope structure and function. NET39 is downregulated in
EDMD patient muscle biopsies, and deletion of Net39 in mice caused nuclear envelope deformations, congenital
myopathy and juvenile lethality. Within the nuclear envelope, NET39 interacts with several components of the
nuclear envelope such as LEMD2. Our studies of NET39 provide an entry point to unravel the long-standing
puzzle of why striated muscle is specifically affected in nuclear envelope related diseases. We hypothesize that
NET39 plays a pivotal skeletal muscle-specific role in the pathogenesis of EDMD. The overall goals of this project
are to define the functions of NET39 and its interactions with other nuclear envelope proteins in regulating nuclear
envelope integrity and gene expression during skeletal muscle homeostasis and disease, and to explore the role
of NET39 in EDMD and other laminopathies. Ultimately, we hope to use these insights to develop new
therapeutic strategies for EDMD and related laminopathies."

The long term goal of this research project has been and continues to be an understanding of the molecular
mechanism of muscle function. The existing project, funded continuously since 1983, has evolved in parallel
with the capabilities of both microscopes and methods for 3-D image reconstruction from electron
microscopes. Originally focused on understanding myosin-actin interactions in situ in muscle using
chemically fixed, plastic embedded and sectioned muscle, it now proposes to take advantage of the resolution
revolution in cryoEM to study the major structural elements of the muscle at the highest resolution possible
using isolated components, followed by a return to imaging actin-myosin interactions in situ in frozen live
muscle cells. Striated muscles have four major components: actin-containing thin filaments, myosin-
containing thick filaments, a Z-disk to crosslink antiparallel thin filaments and a connecting filament to link
the thick filaments to the Z-disk. The least understood of these four elements are the thick filament, the Z-disk
and the connecting filament, whose interactions with the thick filament and Z-disk are its least understood
elements. Thus, our study of Z-disk and thick filament can make major contributions to an understanding of
all three elements. Following a major breakthrough of ours that showed that coiled-coil tail domain of myosin
can be imaged at subnanometer resolution, even near atomic resolution, the project concentrates initially on
subnanometer resolution imaging of thick filaments from several species, to examine the generality and
structural conservation of the “curved molecular crystalline layers” across species and muscle types. The
project will utilize the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how genetic removal of certain
component proteins affects how the myosin tails interact with non-myosin proteins to affect thick filament
properties. We will utilize mutations in the myosin tail of Drosophila that correspond to established disease
causing mutations in human striated muscle. The Z-disk will be studied using methodology developed in our
lab to isolate Z-disks from invertebrates applied to determination of the Drosophila melanogaster Z-disk. The
experimental system will facilitate decoration of the Z-disks with various signaling proteins. Ultimately, the
utility of these studies on components needs development within the myofibril. We will investigate by
cryoelectron tomography frozen-hydrated myofibrils of Lethocerus and Drosophila thinned using FIB/SEM in
states produced using various nucleotides to see how myosin heads interact with the thin filament in situ.
Ultimately, we will apply what we have learned methodologically from these myofibril studies to studies of
live cultured smooth and cardiac muscle cells fast frozen, thinned via FIB/SEM to visualize active interactions
between thick and thin filaments. This work will open to future structural investigation all the structures
present in a muscle cell within their natural context."

 This study examines a community pharmacy-based intervention to reduce opioid medication misuse.
Despite a recent national decline in opioid prescribing, 10.3 million Americans in 2018 reported misusing a pre-
scribed opioid, and within this population, >36% of those who misused obtained the opioid medication by filling
a prescription. The point of medication dispensing, namely the community pharmacy, is a an untapped resource
to address prescription opioid misuse—especially when considering the >60,000 pharmacies employing
>170,000 pharmacists in the US. We have established preliminary data that provides important support for the
current project: (1) pharmacists are concerned about misuse but need training and resources to become in-
volved; (2) community pharmacy patients can be screened successfully for misuse in these settings; (3) we have
established an integrated care intervention amenable to current pharmacy practice—Brief Intervention-Medica-
tion Therapy Management (BI-MTM); and (4) our pilot data has shown support for feasibility, acceptability, pre-
liminary intervention efficacy. Encouraged by these findings, we now aim to conduct a fully-powered RCT of the
BI-MTM intervention in community pharmacy settings that will accomplish 3 Specific Aims. The first Aim will
demonstrate the pharmacist-led BI-MTM intervention is superior to standard medication counseling (SMC) for
mitigating opioid medication misuse. This will be accomplished by conducting a powered single-blinded random-
ized trial to test the efficacy of BI-MTM (n=175) vs. SMC (n=175). Participants will be screened/recruited for
eligibility at point of dispensing in 14 community pharmacies in Utah, a high opioid prescribing and opioid-adverse
event state. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 2, and 6 months for opioid medication misuse. Participant-
level state prescription drug monitoring data will also be linked with patient outcomes to assess objective changes
in medication misuse behaviors (e.g., early refills and doctor/pharmacy shopping). The second Aim will identify
the pathway by which BI-MTM results in improvements for depression, pain, and subsequently opioid misuse.
To accomplish this, a path analysis will assess relationships of BI-MTM: (1) on depression, pain, and misuse,
(2) depression on misuse, and (3) pain on misuse. Our final Aim will explore latent transitions of baseline to post-
intervention misuse classes by intervention group. This will be accomplished by using mixture modeling, specif-
ically multi-group latent transition analysis. We will employ observed misuse indicators to estimate latent class
transitions across time, grouping by treatment condition and adjusting for baseline covariates. Completing SA1-
3 advance the understanding of BI-MTM efficacy and set the stage for a national multisite trial."
10768643,"Lipid homeostasis is crucially important for cells, and disruptions in this balance can lead to diseases of lipid overload,
such as obesity-related disorders. Lipid homeostasis is mainly coordinated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the largest
membrane system in cells. The ER is a well-recognized location for synthesis of membrane and secreted proteins,
processes that are safeguarded by the “unfolded protein response” (UPR). Recent studies suggest that a complementary
and interrelated pathway, which we term the “lipotoxic protective response” (LPR), acts in parallel to maintain ER lipid
homeostasis. In contrast to the UPR, however, knowledge of the molecular aspects of the LPR remain rudimentary. Here
we describe studies to overcome this knowledge gap through investigations through our recent identification of the
mammalian FIT2 protein as a key guardian of ER lipid homeostasis. FIT2 has been a mysterious ER protein, of crucial
importance for cell health and function, that was implicated in ER homeostasis and lipid metabolism but lacked an
identified function. After years of effort and a biochemical tour de force, we have discovered that FIT2 is an acyl-CoA
diphosphatase enzyme that catabolizes fatty acyl-CoAs, the activated forms of fatty acids, in the ER. Our preliminary data
indicate that this activity may be localized on the luminal leaflet and is crucially important for cell health and viability.
Absence of FIT2 triggers ER stress and, in a mouse model we have generated, liver injury. Our findings break new ground
and raise many important questions about FIT2 and the LPR. Here we propose to answer these questions by using an
interdisciplinary approach. Aim 1 will determine mechanisms of the LPR at the molecular level by deciphering the
biochemical mechanism for FIT2’s catabolism of fatty acyl-CoA in the ER. We will combine biochemical and structural
biology approaches to answer: What is the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism? Is FIT2 active towards ER luminal substrates?
Is its activity regulated by lipid metabolites (e.g., diacylglycerol, DAG)? What is the fate of the metabolites generated by
FIT2 activity? Aim 2 will determine mechanisms of the LPR at the cellular level by elucidating how FIT2 and the LPR are
integrated with other ER stress protection pathways. Specifically, we will address: How does FIT2 mechanistically trigger
the UPR? Does the mammalian UPR pathway depend on FIT2 activity? Can the interdependency of the FIT2/LPR and the
UPR be exploited for therapeutic purposes in cancer, for example those with high demands on ER function, such
hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple myeloma? Aim 3 will determine mechanisms of the LPR at the physiological level
by determining how FIT2 maintains lipid homeostasis in mammalian liver. We have generated mice lacking FIT2 in
hepatocytes, and preliminary studies indicate these mice have ER stress, increases in hepatocyte lipid storage, defects in
lipid secretion, and signs of liver disease. We will mechanistically dissect this phenotype to elucidate how FIT2 is
required in cellular lipid metabolism. Completion of these aims will reveal how a fast, enzymatic mechanism functions in
the LPR to protect cells and maintain lipid homeostasis. It will also shed light on the pathogenesis of human disease, such
as the rare human disorder of FIT2 deficiency and more common metabolic diseases involving ER lipid metabolism, with
implications for both liver steatosis and cancers that rely heavily of the ER (such as liver cancer and multiple myeloma)."

The novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, termed SARS-CoV-2, quickly spread throughout the world
and has killed millions. A critical aspect of this pandemic that remains understudied is the impact of immunity to
seasonal coronaviruses on COVID-19 disease. Several lines of evidence suggest there is an impact but the
nature of that impact remains unclear. We have preliminary data confirming our colony of 5,000 rhesus
macaques harbors a large fraction of animals with preexisting immunity to coronaviruses of unknown origin.
This immunity may be important in the use of these animals for COVID-19 and other coronavirus disease. We
hypothesize that our colony seasonally circulates human seasonal coronaviruses but we need to identify the
actual viruses circulating. Here, we will use multiple approaches to assess the frequency of these infections
and to identify the actual viruses. In Aim 1, we will use pan-coronavirus primers to quantify coronavirus
infections in our colony. We will sample both nasal and rectal sites as coronaviruses are known to be shed
from both. In Aim 2, we will use next generation sequencing to identify the viruses circulating. We will apply
phylogenetic approaches to characterize the diversity of the virus or viruses in our colony. These data will have
important implications for the use of macaques for coronavirus infections in general and may shed light on the
coronavirus family."
10766201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An emerging role of microbiome in cancer is the capacity of microorganisms to impact treatment, drug efficacy
and metabolism. For example, we recently showed that the gut microbiome plays an important role in castration
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through microbial-derived androgen synthesis (Pernigoni et al. Science.
2021;374(6564):216-224). In that study, we found that androgen deprivation in both mice and humans promotes
the expansion of specific gut bacteria capable of converting testosterone precursors into active testosterone,
through bacterial CYP17A1-like enzymes (Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus sp. and Bacteroides
acidifaciens), thus increasing its levels in patients and mice with CRPC and preventing complete suppression of
testosterone during androgen deprivation therapy. In addition to the biosynthetic route, testosterone
bioavailability could represent an additional means to regulate therapeutic responses. Androgens are
glucuronidated in the liver for elimination and a fraction of these glucuronidated androgens reaches the gut
through the bile and are targeted by bacterial β-glucuronidases (GUS) (Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus
sp., Bacteroides acidifaciens and Clostridium scindens) for “reactivation” and potentially reabsorption. In fact,
androgen concentration is higher in the intestine than in serum of human males. Another route by which gut
microbiota contribute to the bioavailability of androgens is through cortisol to 11β-Hydroxyandrostenedione
conversion by bacterial steroid-17,20-desmolases (Clostridium scindens desABCD operon). In turn, 11β-
Hydroxyandrostenedione is converted to 11-oxyandrogen, which contribute to the tumor androgen pool. It is
unclear how much each of these different routes contribute to the pool of circulating androgens. Our central
hypothesis is that gut microbiome contributes to the production and bioavailability of androgens through a
combination of biosynthetic and bioavailability routes. The objective of this project is to computationally identify
androgen-related bacterial enzymes (CYP17A1-like, GUS, desA and desB) in CRPC patients gut microbiome
and to isolate bacterial species harboring those enzymes for functional analysis. The rationale for the proposed
research is that the outcomes will provide targets for future development and evaluation of interventions in CRPC
patients that minimize or prevent the bioavailability of androgens. Our hypothesis will be tested through two
specific aims: Aim 1) Identify androgen-related bacterial enzymes in the gut microbiome of prostate cancer
patients. Aim 2) Functional characterization of bacterial species possessing androgen-related enzymes. At
completion, this project will identify bacterial enzymes involved in androgen biotransformation and biosynthesis
and obtain bacterial species harboring these enzymes. This knowledge will serve as a springboard for future
functional studies using preclinical models of CRPC and inhibitors targeting bacterial androgen biotransformation
and synthesis enzymes and/or species that harbor them to alleviate CRPC, thus providing an innovative
approach to slow or prevent prostate cancer progression."
10915405,"Candida auris is a fungal pathogen that has been identified as an emerging infectious disease and a public
health threat. C. auris is notable for its resistance to antifungal therapy, its transmissibility, its high mortality rate
as well as its ability to colonize patients, healthcare personnel and healthcare environments. C. auris strains are
typically resistant to fluconazole and approximately half of C. auris strains are resistant to two or more anti-fungal
drugs. C. auris causes nosocomial outbreaks of invasive candidiasis with mortality rates of ~60%. There are five
distinct clades of C. auris, all of which appear to have evolved since 1996. In addition to its drug resistance, C.
auris can colonize skin, spread from person-to-person and survive in healthcare environments for long periods of
time. These features are unique to C. auris. C. auris is resistant to many standard decontamination reagents and
protocols, which has resulted in the rapid spread of this pathogen throughout the world. This makes it a
particularly dangerous emerging fungal pathogen. Thus, it is not surprising that C. auris is the first fungal
pathogen that has been identified as a public health threat. What is needed is a C. auris specific vaccine that can
prevent and/or ameliorate the morbidity, mortality and dissemination of this emerging fungal pathogen. The
research outlined in this proposal directly addresses this pressing need. We have discovered that the mannan
which coats the outermost surface of C. auris clinical strains is both structurally and biologically unique, i.e. it
contains two unique acid labile Mα1-PO4 side chains that are not found in other fungal mannans or other fungal
pathogens. Thus, C. auris mannan distinguishes it from virtually all other fungal pathogens. This suggests that C.
auris mannan represents a target of opportunity for the development of a C. auris vaccine. We hypothesize that
the dual Mα1-PO4 mannan structure can be used to develop a C. auris vaccine that will be effective against
multiple C. auris strains. The goals of this R21 proposal are to: i) evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in a murine

objectives we propose two specific aims. Aim 1. Evaluate the efficacy of a C. auris mannan based vaccine
formulation against systemic C. auris infection. Aim 2. Assess innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by
the C. auris mannan vaccine."
10755749,"Abstract. Over 70 percent of older adults aged 65 or older require assistance from caregivers with basic
functions at some point in their lifetime, and more than six million older adults in the US have Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) and require more extensive assistance than
their counterparts without AD/ADRD. As the US population is aging and more people seek to age in their
homes instead of moving to institutional care facilities such as nursing homes, there is a substantial need for
in-home healthcare and supportive services. Home care services provided by home care workers therefore
play an increasingly crucial role in the US health care system. Indeed, the home care workforce has become
one of the fastest growing occupations in the nation. However, the Federal Fair Labor Standard Act (1938)
excluded home care workers from the federal minimum wage and overtime protection under the
“companionship exemption”, which contributed to the challenging labor market conditions for home care
workers and could in turn have a negative impact on older adults who needed high-quality home care services.
In 2013, the Department of Labor narrowed the “companionship exemption” and promulgated the “Home Care
Rule” (HCR) by allowing certain types of home care services to be protected by federal minimum wage and
overtime rules. The new HCR came into effect in January 2015. This new HCR affected states differently due
to variations in pre-existing state regulations on minimum wage exemptions, rates and overtime pay, providing
a natural experiment that we explore in this study to provide the first empirical evidence on the effects of the
new HCR on older adults’ utilization of and spending on home (and other forms of) care. We will use
difference-in-differences and event-study approaches along with large, nationally representative datasets to
pursue the following two interrelated aims in this quasi-experimental study: Aim #1: We will test how the new
HCR has changed older adults’ utilization of home care services, using self-reported individual-level measures
of utilization from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data and county-level measures of utilization from
the Geographic Variation Public Use File developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Aim
#2: We will test how the new HCR has changed older adults’ spending on home care, using the same two
datasets for Aim 1A. We will explore the heterogeneous effects of the new HCR on older adults’ utilization of
and spending on home care along key dimensions including their AD/ADRD status using the HRS data. This
study directly serves the overall purpose of NIH PAS-19-391, namely, “…to provide needed scientific insight to
improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and/or care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and
Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD)” by “leveraging existing data”. Findings from this study will
have significant policy implications, as the size and the life expectancy of the older adult population, especially
the population with AD/ADRD, and the costs of health care continue to rise.

The vision of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) is to develop collaborative approaches for data management and sharing through inclusion of established generalist repositories in the NIH data ecosystem and better enable search and discovery of NIH funded data in the generalist repositories. This is one of the steps in the modernization of the data resources ecosystem and aligns with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science.
The primary mission of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative is to establish a common set of cohesive and consistent capabilities, services, metrics, and social infrastructure across various generalist repositories. A secondary mission is to also raise general awareness and facilitate researchers to adopt FAIR principles to better share and reuse data.
The objectives of the project are to work together with the other awardee teams to develop a “co-opetition plan” that include a commitment to a solution architecture, data submission and QA/QC capabilities to support relevant use cases, train and educate users, as well as provide usage analytics and reporting to the NIH."
10774279,"Project Summary
 This resubmission proposal aims to elucidate the role of a histone deacetylase, HDAC11, in diseases such
as multiple sclerosis (MS), and to establish HDAC11 inhibition as a potentially effective new treatment strategy
for diseases including MS. MS is a chronic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous
system. Like many autoimmune disorders, it presently has no known cure, and current drugs available for
managing this disease are only effective early on and are accompanied by many adverse effects. The disease
mechanism of MS remains unclear, and no effective targeted therapy is available for chronic progressive MS.
Our preliminary studies show that deletion of HDAC11 ameliorates clinical symptoms in a mouse model of MS.
In parallel, we discovered a novel HDAC11 enzymatic activity that is >10,000-fold more efficient than its
deacetylase activity. This novel activity allows us to begin to uncover physiologic substrates of HDAC11, which
in turn will help to uncover the biological mechanisms of HDAC11’s actions. One of the goals of this research is
to investigate how this newly discovered enzymatic activity underlies the immune-regulatory function of
HDAC11 in MS. Knowledge gained from these studies will help to further understand the disease mechanism
of MS and to develop better therapeutics. Because the discovery of a novel HDAC11 activity has enabled us to
develop, for the first time, HDAC11-specific inhibitors, the chief objective is to further improve these inhibitors
and test whether they can be used to treat diseases such as MS in our established mouse models. Our
multidisciplinary team has expertise in all aspects needed to make this project successful. Overall, the
proposed studies in this application will not only yield a better understanding of HDAC11’s function in health
and diseases, but may also result in a first prototype targeted therapy for the treatment of chronic progressive
MS, and possibly other diseases as well."
10798139,"Agonists of the beta-2-adrenoceptor (b2AR), commonly referred to as b-agonists, have been a cornerstone of
asthma treatment for nearly half a century. Despite their utility, b-agonists used in asthma management have
problems, including functional tachyphylaxis, deterioration of asthma control, and mortality concerns. Moreover,
lingering safety concerns regarding long-acting b-agonists necessitate the concomitant use of corticosteroids.
The inability to understand why such problems exist and the failure to significantly improve b2AR pharmacology
is reflected by over 2 decades of NIH Program announcements declaring the need for safer, more efficacious
alternatives to asthma treatment. Over the last 2 decades our team has employed a robust combination of genetic
and molecular approaches to convincingly demonstrate that both endogenous and exogenous b-agonist promote
the asthma phenotype, and that the b2AR regulatory protein, b-arrestin-2 is critical to the limited efficacy, and
safety issues, associated with b-agonist use in asthma. Despite our work to date which constitutes compelling
proof of principle, a corrective pharmacological approach sufficiently feasible to advance has been unavailable
until now. In collaboration with colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University we have characterized a novel b2AR
agonist as well as b2AR allosteric modulator (AM) that provide the therapeutic signaling of b-agonists yet allow
the b2AR to avoid (pathology-inducing) engagement of b-arrestins. These compounds are the first b2AR
ligands/AMs capable of “biasing” b2AR to increase Gs protein signaling. We propose to use our preclinical in vivo
and cell-based models to: 1) establish that these novel compounds are superior to current b-agonists with respect
to mitigating the central features of asthma (airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness (AHR)) while
maintaining bronchodilation function, 2) determine the specific cell type(s) through which these drugs work and
3) address a fundamental conundrum in the field of GPCR biology - do b-arrestins impact function and disease
by generating their own signal, or are their effects due to their inhibition of canonical b2AR signaling? In Aim 1
we will establish the ability of novel b2AR-biasing compounds to mitigate the asthma phenotype in in vivo and
cell-based models. In Aim 2 we will use using genetic and pharmacological approaches to establish epithelial
cell b2AR-arrestin biasing as critical to the permissive effect of b-agonist in promoting the asthma phenotype.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will establish the mechanisms by which novel b2AR biasing compounds regulate airway cell
functions that contribute to the asthma phenotype."
10792887,"Project Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common and highly inherited of all developmental disorders,
with heritability exceeding 0.80. Although remarkable advances in genetics have identified rare de novo
mutations in select brain genes, by definition, none of these relate to the pronounced heritability of autism
relevant to the vast proportion of cases in the population. Given that heritability has been shown to be a function
of additive genetic risk, inferring an impractically large number of genetic targets for intervention, an important
strategy is to identify convergent mechanisms of polygenic risk factors by elucidating intermediate phenotypes
(i.e., endophenotypes) through which they exert their causal influence. Our group has identified two such
candidates that appear highly contributory but not sufficient for ASD: (i) the social behavioral phenotype indexed
by quantitative (subclinical) autistic traits in parents (QAT-p); and (ii) variation in social visual engagement (SVE),
an eye-tracking measure based on viewing of dynamic social scenes. Both can be ascertained in the first year
of life using rapid acquisition methods of less than 20 minutes. Our team’s prior work strongly supports a
developmental model in which autism arises from joint additive genetic effects of these and other
neurodevelopmental liabilities, suggesting that targeting a discrete group of early-contributing liabilities before
autism develops offers the greatest opportunity for high-impact, personalized intervention for children at risk for
common, polygenic forms of ASD.
The primary objective of this research program is to validate wearable-sensor methodology (bilateral, wrist-worn
accelerometers) for quantifying two additional endophenotypes: hyperactivity (HYP, as an early marker of
liability to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which is strongly comorbid with autism) and
impairment in motor coordination (MOT). We will examine HYP and MOT in three distinct samples. Aim I
will study 120 pairs of infant twins first assessed at 6 months of age and then followed at ages 18 and 36 months
to evaluate early associations between HYP, MOT, QAT, and SVE, as well as their heritability and ability to
predict quantitative variation in autistic traits among the twins. Aim II will study a cohort of 50 toddlers diagnosed
with idiopathic ASD to determine whether novel sensor-based metrics of HYP and MOT show differences
between the twins and children with ASD. Aim III will study a legacy cohort of 120 infants at elevated risk for
autism due to prematurity and/or cerebellar injury, in whom we will explore relationships between cerebellar
structure and function in the first year of life and a) sensor-based indices of HYP and MOT, b) quantitative autistic
traits, and c) performance-based indices of motor ability at age three years. This project is expected to yield a
rich, comprehensive understanding of motor endophenotypes in infants and children and their contributions to
autism, with the eventual goal of providing a launching point for future screening and early intervention studies
in high-risk children."
10775712,"Summary
 Stress hormones elicit profound and complex effects throughout the lifespan, and adolescent brain is
particularly sensitive to stressors. One important but understudied question is the sexually dimorphic effects of
early life stress. Using mice exposed to prolonged post-weaning social isolation stress, we have found distinct
behavioral phenotypes that are reminiscent to human symptoms - elevated aggression in males, and
diminished sociability in females. The goal of this project is to understand the physiological and molecular
mechanisms underlying the sex-specific divergent effects of chronic adolescent isolation stress. We
hypothesize that circuit-specific alterations of neuronal functions in stressed males and females, which are
driven by circuit-specific changes in gene expression, mediate the sexually dimorphic consequences of early
life stress. To test this, we will use the combination of cutting-edge techniques to address three Specific Aims:
(1) To identify differential behavioral and physiological changes induced by stress in male and female mice. A
battery of behavioral assays will be made to identify stress-induced phenotypes in both sexes. Slice recordings
of synaptic currents and in vivo multichannel recordings of neuronal activity in behaving animals will be
performed to examine the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral
tegmental area (VTA) in the heightened aggression in stressed males and diminished sociability in stressed
females. (2) To determine neuronal circuits mediating differential effects of stress in male and female mice. By
combining chemogenetic technology to manipulate neuronal activity in specific brain circuits with in vivo
recordings of calcium signal and neuronal spikes in behaving animals, we will examine whether the disturbed
PFCBLA and PFCVTA pathway after chronic isolation stress plays a causal role in controlling the sexually
dimorphic behavioral effects of stress. (3) To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the circuit-specific
effects of stress in male and female mice. We will perform RNAseq to analyze the alteration of mRNA profile in
PFC, BLA, and VTA from males and females exposed to adolescent isolation stress to determine molecular
basis for the sexually dimorphic effects of stress. We will also use viral-based gene transfer to manipulate key
molecules to determine their roles in different aspects of stress effects in both males and females. This
proposal will address important issues on neuronal underpinnings of the sex-specific diverse consequences of
adolescent stress. The identified mechanisms will offer insights into the development of novel precision therapy
to mitigate the distinct deficits in males and females after stress exposure."
10840433,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project aims to develop, validate, and translate a novel class of nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) for the
surgical repair and healing of large defects in thick peripheral nerves by restoring their continuity and functions.
The research team includes an innovative and productive expert in nanotechnology from the Department of
Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a top neurosurgeon and scientist from the
Department of Neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine. Guided by the anatomic structure of
peripheral nerve, as well as the biochemistry and cell biology involved in injury and repair, the investigators
design, fabricate, and validate multi-tubular conduits (mNGCs) using fibers electrospun from a biocompatible
and biodegradable polymer. The mNGC is typically constructed by wrapping a honeycomb array of 3 or 7
small, single-tubular conduits inside a large, single-tubular conduit. The wall of each conduit contains three
layers: uniaxially-aligned fibers to longitudinally guide axonal extension for both the inner and outer layers,
together with random fibers (welded at cross points) sandwiched in between to circumvent tearing or collapsing
during surgery. Besides the topographic cue associated with the aligned fibers, the surface of each fiber in the
inner layer is further engraved with longitudinal nanogrooves to accelerate neurite outgrowth by providing more
sensing targets and contact pads to the filopodia in the growth cone. In addition, neurotrophic factors (NTFs)
are loaded in hollow microparticles of natural fatty acids and then photo-cross-linked to create a unidirectional
gradient in degradation half-life along the conduit. The proposed activities are broadly divided into three major
thrusts: i) controlling the degradation rate of hollow microparticles made of natural fatty acids and thus release
kinetics of NTFs through photo-cross-linking; ii) evaluating the 3-in-1 mNGCs for sciatic nerve repair in a rat
model; and iii) assessing the 7-in-1 mNGCs for facial nerve repair in a porcine model. The NGCs are
anticipated to augment nerve regeneration as a result of the synergistic effect arising from the aligned fibers,
the nanogrooves on the surface of the fibers, and the steady supply of NTFs, improving the health and quality
of life for individuals afflicted by peripheral nerve injuries."

Under the current clinical paradigm, the majority of patients sharing a pathology tend to be treated in a similar
manner according to clinical guidelines that are based on previously conducted clinical trials combined into meta-
analyses. While some situations are amendable to the stratification of care, that is using more or less intensive
therapy based on the presence of specific risk factors, true personalization of care (i.e. therapeutic or
management selected based on a comprehensive review of patient characteristics and possibly including
patient-specific prediction models) remains exceedingly rare despite the potential for improved patient-level
outcomes. One important question in this regard that has not yet been answered is the extent to which a
personalized approach would result in clinical benefits should it be used in a large number of patients. At this
time, given the paucity of examples of large scale implementation of personalized care, it is not possible to
directly provide an answer; however, we could use existing data to generate a reliable approximation through
computer simulations. Thus, we propose to use data from ~130 previously published NHLBI funded randomized
clinical trials to simulate the effect of personalized medicine and compare the group-level outcomes to results
expected in the same patient population without using a personalized approach to treatment choice. Specifically,
for each clinical trial included in this study, we will create arm-specific prediction models for the primary outcome
and apply it to the opposite study group, thus estimating the theoretical, patient-specific probability of achieving
the primary outcome had they been assigned to the opposite trial arm. Simulations will then be performed
separately for all trials where patients are respectively assigned to: 1) the treatment arm of the trial, 2) the control
arm of the trial or 3) to whatever arm carries the lowest probability of adverse outcomes (i.e. predictive allocation).
We will then calculate the net benefit of predictive allocation by comparing the cumulative prevalence of
outcomes in that simulation vs. either the simulation where all patients are assigned to either the treatment arm
(for positive trials) or where all patients are assigned to the control arm (for negative trials). Finally, we will
compile the data from all included trials and identify factors that are associated with changes in the net benefit
of predictive allocation, including both trial-specific risk factors and performance metrics of the prediction model
used for patient allocation. This study will allow us, for the first time, to estimate the potential improvement, at
the population level, that would be associated with the widespread utilization of a personalized approach to
treatment choice. We will also generate crucial information in regards to the clinical scenarios and situations
where such an approach would generate the highest benefits. This information will be essential for the efficient
and targeted implementation of future personalized medicine programs."
10869921,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of chronic viral hepatitis that increases dramatically the risk of liver
cancer and other end-stage liver diseases such as cirrhosis. The major obstacle to curing chronic HBV
infection is the persistence of the viral nuclear episome, the covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which is
derived from the relaxed circular (RC) DNA contained within the viral nucleocapsid. Moreover, the inability
of mouse hepatocytes to support CCC DNA formation remains a major hurdle in the development of an
immuno-competent mouse model for HBV infection. This MERIT Award Extension application builds on,
and extends, our current work on the disassembly of viral nucleocapsids (uncoating), which releases the
RC DNA into the host cell nucleus, a prerequisite step for nuclear CCC DNA formation but also exposing
RC DNA for potential degradation or triggering of host cell DNA sensing and immune responses. The main
goal of the Extension is to better understand viral and host control of HBV CCC DNA formation and
infection. Four Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will elucidate the deficiencies in mouse hepatocytes for
HBV infection. Aim 2 will develop cell-free systems for nucleocapsid uncoating and CCC DNA formation.
Aim 3 will define the late HBV entry events controlled by the viral capsid and host factors. Aim 4 will assess
the role of DNA sensing in HBV infection.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global cause of chronic liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and cancer.
We propose to elucidate the mechanisms of, and viral and host factors involved in, the viral trafficking
events during infection and the disassembly of HBV nucleocapsid, which are essential but poorly
understood steps in viral replication and contribute to the host tropism of HBV. These studies will bring
novel insights into HBV infection and nucleocapsid disassembly and facilitate ongoing efforts to develop
novel antiviral agents targeted at these processes as well as mouse models of HBV infection."

 Hanson’s disease (HD), more commonly known as leprosy, is thought of as an ancient
disease that has been eradicated, yet in 2019, the number of new cases reported globally to the WHO
was more than 200,000. Up to 80% of the new leprosy cases presenting from around the world are
unable to relate ever having come in contact with another person who had leprosy. The lack of a
plausible biological contact source can provoke profound anxiety in newly diagnosed patients and
contributes to the stigmatization of leprosy as a mystical curse or punishment. In the United States,
armadillos are a large natural reservoir of Mycobacterium leprae and the same strain of bacteria
that circulates among armadillos also is responsible for 54% of the indigenous cases; thus, leprosy is
recognized as a zoonosis in the United States. It is realized that M. leprae is not stable in the
environment, so an intermediary host, such as an arthropod vector, may contribute to the
transmission of leprosy. The overall goal of this project is to determine the vector potential for blood-
feeding ticks to acquire and transmit infectious M. leprae to vertebrate hosts. Additionally, the
transcriptional activity of M. leprae in an arthropod host background will be compared to the M.
leprae transcriptome while in a vertebrate host. Combined, this project will potentially identify an
alternate route of leprosy transmission and the M. leprae molecules putatively associated with
this transmission cycle. The data generated from the proposed studies will greatly enhance our
understanding of the epidemiology of leprosy as it will be the first assessment of the biology of
M. leprae infection and transmission by Amblyomma ticks. Based on field surveys and experimental
evidence we suspect that Amblyomma ticks are competent vectors for M. leprae. Tick vector
competence for M. leprae has not been thoroughly explored under controlled laboratory conditions
previously, so the relevance of the findings from this project will provide novel information that can be
related to the ecology and epidemiology of leprosy."

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transition state between healthy cognitive aging and dementia.
The estimated prevalence of MCI is 7% for individuals between 60-64 years old and increases to 25% for
those 80-84 years old. There is a need to identify mechanisms that contribute to MCI with the aim of delaying
the onset or preventing Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. The 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia
prevention, intervention, and care highlighted that midlife hypertension contributes to increased risk for MCI in
late life. Signs of hypertension in the retinal microvessels indicate vascular re-modeling and this re-modeling is
likely happening in the other end organs, such as the brain. There is a gap in knowledge on the relationship
between hypertensive retinopathy and cognitive function decline during aging. The goal of our proposal is to fill
this knowledge gap and advance understanding of the retinal microvessels as a biomarker of hypertensive
effects on cognitive function. We hypothesize that hypertensive retinopathy is associated with lower cognitive
function during aging. We will test this hypothesis with the existing data from the Michigan cohort of the Study
of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN-MI), which is an ongoing 27-year longitudinal study of women
during the transition from midlife to early old age. The longitudinal data relevant for this proposal includes
social determinants of health, cardiovascular parameters, cognitive tests, surveys, and selected blood
chemistries. At the 2016/17 visit, a standardized eye exam and retina imaging that included digital fundus
photographs and optical coherence tomography was performed on 215 women (age 66 ± 2.7 years; 61% black
and 39% white). Using this unique, high-quality SWAN-MI dataset, the objectives of our secondary analyses
include: a) characterizing the relationships between longitudinal cardiovascular data and hypertensive
retinopathy assessed by clinical exam and retina imaging, and b) testing the association between hypertensive
retinopathy and cognitive function during aging. We will test our hypothesis with two aims. Aim 1: Characterize
microvascular features of hypertensive retinopathy and relationships with longitudinal cardiovascular data.
Aim 2: Characterize the relationship between microvascular features in the retina with cognitive function during
aging. Results from our proposed studies will contribute new knowledge about the hypertension-related
mechanisms of dementia, one of public health and social care priorities worldwide with a rapid aging
population. Furthermore, these studies may lead to the formation of integrated health networks that include
teleophthalmology with retinal imaging and eye care providers to improve healthy aging."
10814341,"ABSTRACT. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition defined by the presence of endometrial-like
tissue outside the uterus that often presents with pain and infertility, affecting approximately 10% of reproductive
aged women. While some women respond well to hormonal therapy or surgical treatment, others do not and are
plagued with continued or worsening pain. Many patients whose lives are substantially impacted by
endometriosis associated pelvic pain (EAPP) experienced a transition from acute to persistent pain, often early
in life, and subsequent worsening of symptoms. Once pain becomes persistent, it is often refractory to current
treatments and may further evolve to include debilitating comorbid symptoms such as back, bladder and bowel
pain, as well as widespread pain and fatigue. Identifying prognostic biomarkers associated with persistent and/or
refractory EAPP would allow for strategic selection of treatments and interventions in vulnerable patients before
pain becomes entrenched. Our overarching hypothesis is that neuroimmune/inflammatory markers can help
identify women at risk for developing persistent and/or nociplastic pain. Specifically, we hypothesize that
neuroimmune/inflammatory activity contributes to both the emergence and persistence of EAPP during
adolescence, as well as the development of nociplastic pain in adults. Our preliminary analyses suggest that
inflammatory and neuroimmune pathways are associated with more severe symptoms and may be implicated in
the transition to persistent and/or refractory pain. In this proposal, we will leverage existing longitudinal
questionnaire data and banked biospecimens (serial blood and peritoneal fluid) collected from females younger
than 25 years participating in the Women’s Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood (A2A) to evaluate the
emergence of EAPP. Further, following harmonized protocols we will collect blood samples, peritoneal fluid, and
functional MRIs from a new cohort of adult women with established EAPP that began in adolescence who are
undergoing both surgical and non-surgical therapies at the University of Michigan (UM) in order to evaluate
markers of nociplastic EAPP. We will apply an innovative proteomics platform (basic science component) that
has shown high reproducibility and can simultaneously measure >7,000 proteins. Detailed longitudinal
assessment of endometriosis-associated symptoms (clinical/translational component), based on self-reported
pain (both studies) and fMRI (UM cohort only), and biomarker quantification will be harmonized between the two
cohorts to determine robust associations with persistent EAPP. By leveraging systemic and local biomarkers in
combination with detailed pain assessment over time, this project is uniquely poised to identify biomarkers
associated with persistent endometriosis-associated pain and emergence of nociplastic pain to advance our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to pelvic pain."

This R03 proposal is a supplement to the K23 proposal of Dr. Xingxing S. Cheng, MD MS. The purpose of Dr.
Cheng’s K23 is to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney
disease on the waitlist for kidney transplantation. The purpose of this R03 proposal is to examine the entirety of
pretransplant services, of which coronary artery disease screening is a part, and their associations with
outcomes and costs. Medicare is currently paying, at cost, over 70% of the costs of pretransplant services,
including evaluation for addition to the waitlist, surveillance on the waitlist, and living donor evaluation and
procurement. These costs are reported by transplant programs to Medicare in the Organ Acquisition Cost
Center (OACC). The proposed research will crosslink two databases in which Dr. Cheng’s team have already
demonstrated expertise at a program-year (not individual patient) level: 1) OACC cost data from the Hospital
Cost Report and 2) aggregated program-year data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
(SRTR). The two aims of the proposal will be to assess the association of the quantity of pretransplant services
with 1) pretransplant outcomes (quality) and 2) costs.
The proposed research expands the scope of Dr. Cheng’s K23 award to the broad range of pretransplant care,
and provides Dr. Cheng with the opportunity for more econometric training. The proposed research will an
empirical overview of the relative distribution of costs and value among the types of pretransplant services and
create a rich database of pretransplant services, outcomes, and costs at a transplant program-level. A next-
step R01 grant will evaluate potential policy and practice guideline changes for pretransplant care on the basis
of value. This R03 will therefore supplement the K23 award to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful
independent clinical investigator."

The Community Engagement, Bioethics, and Outreach (CEBO) Core focuses on expanding the inclusion of
rural populations in acute care research projects requiring urgent initiation of therapy. In a rural state such as
Maine, urban regions concentrate academic medical resources into a few locations that may be many hours
from rural communities and regional hospitals. Patients outside these urban centers are at a significant
disadvantage regarding access to tertiary-level care and participation in medical research. Contributing factors
to this disparity include lack of awareness of ongoing research, geographic and transportation barriers, lower
numbers of eligible participants, and few clinician researchers. These challenges are pronounced for time-
pressured research for life-altering medical problems such as stroke, cardiac arrest, and neonatal
asphyxiation. Ensuring appropriate human subject protection and enhancing rural enrollment requires informed
and experienced researchers, but these essential resources are limited in our urban centers, and critically
lacking in our rural healthcare environment. Patients with these acute conditions are often not awake or
medically stable enough to provide informed consent, and it is often too late to enroll them hours later when
legally authorized representatives arrive at receiving tertiary care centers. To address these challenges, the
Department of Health and Human Services developed the Exception From Informed Consent (EFIC) pathway,
allowing research to proceed without consent under strict conditions, including robust community consultation
and public disclosure prior to initiating the study. Little research has addressed the implications of rurality on
EFIC - it is not known whether EFIC is as effective for rural communities as for urban settings, whether EFIC
increases recruitment from rural areas, and whether rural patients prefer EFIC or emerging options such as
remote teleconsent. The CEBO Core will address these issues to support the COBRE Project Leaders
pursuing acute care research in rural and urban settings across Maine. The core will: 1) Provide direct
assistance to COBRE Project Leaders in recruitment strategies, consent processes, and document preparation
for IRB submission; 2) Engage rural community members (patients, clinicians and other stakeholders) to better
understand their perspectives, preferences, and barriers to participation in research requiring urgent treatment,
and the ethical tradeoffs associated with different approaches to enrollment; and 3) Enhance research training,
regulatory compliance, and proper research conduct among COBRE Project Leaders, early career researchers
and mentors at Maine Medical Center, and emerging clinical researchers at rural sites engaged in these
COBRE projects by developing research networks and associated educational programs to support expanded
acute care clinical research."

 Patients in rural areas who suffer a cardiac arrest have had worse outcomes compared to those in urban
areas. This is due in part to socioeconomic disparities influencing the underlying risk of cardiovascular disease,
availability of emergency medical services, and transport time. In addition, little attention is paid to the workflow
of patient care after a pulse has been restored. Improving standardization of care between the time patients
arrive in the emergency department through the remainder of their care is an important opportunity to limit the
disparities seen in rural areas. The hypothesis that underlies this project is that trending risk-adjusted
outcomes over time at a state-level, combined with standardization of post-resuscitation care, will improve
outcomes for rural patients and thus decrease rural disparities across the state. This project brings together
local expertise in epidemiology, policy reform and qualitative studies to 1) determine the influence of rurality on
cardiac arrest mortality using risk-adjusted analysis of all patients treated after cardiac arrest across Maine;
and 2) develop a multi-center learning community for hyper-acute post-cardiac arrest management to measure
treatment metrics and implement standardization protocols to reduce geographical disparities. In the first aim,
we will utilize nationally available emergency medical department data to perform a risk-adjusted analysis of
statewide available data to determine how rurality affects overall outcomes across the state and identify the
variability of outcome among rural areas. In the second aim, we will develop a learning community in seven
centers across rural, regional and tertiary centers to implement established protocols for the hyper-acute
management of cardiac arrest care. We will use patient-level data to determine baseline and subsequent
benchmark data and measure how this changes over time, while taking into consideration regional resources
and differences in health care systems. The completion of this project is a critical step in achieving the long-
term goal of creating a method to improve systems of care for the state of Maine that can be replicated in other
rural states, which will reduce rural health disparities related to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
 This project is led by Dr. Teresa May, a junior clinical researcher with a background in critical care and
neurocritical care who recently completed KL2 training where she studied in-hospital aspects of post-cardiac
arrest care. With strong mentorship in the areas of rural health research, complex survey designs, data
analysis (Y. Jonk) and increasing access to clinical trials in rural areas and implementation science research
(R. Kramer), she is well positioned to succeed. This project represents a unique opportunity for Dr. May to
develop experience in data-driven development of multi-center learning communities to standardize and
improve efficiency of post-resuscitation care. Project results will be applicable to other rural areas around the
country, increasing the impact of this research."
10788297,"Abstract
 Early-onset pneumonia occurs in up to 65% of comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest and is associated with significant morbidity. Pneumonia, and cardiac arrest in general, is associated with
uncontrolled systemic inflammation as part of the post-resuscitation cardiac arrest syndrome. Because
inflammation and pneumonia may precipitate secondary brain injury, preventing them may improve outcomes.
Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, has an excellent anti-microbial spectrum, and has anti-
inflammatory as well as potential neuroprotective effects. Our previous studies identified a novel cellular
mechanism where ceftriaxone increases expression of CD73 on T lymphocytes, which stimulates adenosine
production and decreases release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, we hypothesize that prophylactic
ceftriaxone will reduce early-onset pneumonia and T cell-mediated inflammation in survivors of out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest treated with targeted temperature management. Our specific aims are to: 1) quantify the clinical
and microbiologic effects of prophylactic ceftriaxone in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors treated with
targeted temperature management, and 2) determine if prophylactic ceftriaxone suppresses T cell-mediated
inflammation via increased CD73/adenosine signaling. We will conduct a single-center, prospective,
randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at Maine Medical Center testing a three-day course of
ceftriaxone or placebo. Because potential bacterial resistance is a concern with antibiotic prophylaxis, we will
also evaluate bacterial resistomes in patient airway and gut. Our immediate goals are to conduct a pragmatic
clinical trial, characterize a novel mechanism of action of ceftriaxone on T cell activity, and gain the experience,
expertise, and infrastructure needed to conduct a multicenter clinical trial.
 This project is led by Dr. David Gagnon, a clinical pharmacist at Maine Medical Center who specializes in
Critical Care Pharmacy. Dr. Gagnon is a Critical Care Scholar-in-Residence and is an early career investigator
establishing a research program in pharmacotherapy. He has established fruitful research collaborations with
other members of this COBRE group, and will be mentored in this project by an established clinical researcher
with experience in multi-site clinical trials including study of patients with susceptibility to lung infections (J.
Zuckerman) and a pharmacologist researcher with experience in neuroscience and pathophysiology (K.
Houseknecht). This project is a foundational opportunity for Dr. Gagnon to work towards his long-term goal of
establishing effective pharmacotherapy options for cardiac arrest survivors to improve functional and
neurological outcomes. As a component of this thematically-linked COBRE, he will collaborate with colleagues
on related studies to provide a synergistic impact to improve cardiac arrest care across diverse communities."

Established in 2010, the PROTECT Superfund Research Center integrates research, training and stakeholder 
engagement to provide solutions for reducing pollutant risks to pregnancy in Puerto Rico and nationwide. This 
project contributes to the mission of PROTECT with toxicological studies of disruption of the placenta and 
extraplacental membranes as potential mechanisms of preterm birth. Experiments will use explant cultures of 
primary human placental villous and extraplacental membranes (EPM) from healthy term deliveries as highly 
relevant human tissue models that allow experimental manipulation for toxicity assessment and avoid 
complications of inter-species differences. This proposal continues study of Superfund chemicals relevant to 
Puerto Rico – di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and trichloroethylene (TCE) – with addition of di-(2- 
ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP) which is an alternative phthalate of increasing commercial use that is 
structurally related to DEHP. Because most adverse health effects of phthalates and TCE are attributed to 
metabolites, experiments will be conducted with systemically distributed metabolites of DEHP (mono-[2- 
ethylhexyl] phthalate and mono-[2-ethyl-carboxypropyl] phthalate), DEHTP (mono-[2-ethylhexyl] terephthalate 
and mono-[2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl] terephthalate), and TCE (trichloroacetate and S-(1, 2-dichlorovinyl)-L- 
cysteine). Furthermore, we will assess the combined exposure of the aforementioned phthalate metabolites in 
a reconstituted mixture based on their relative urinary concentrations in Puerto Rican women. Because the 
placenta is highly perfused, these blood-borne metabolites are efficiently delivered to the placenta in exposed 
women. This proposal builds on current knowledge – and past successes of this project and center – to 
propose the overarching hypothesis that phthalate and TCE metabolites activate oxidative stress upstream of 
cytokine responses that disrupt the function of the placenta and EPM, thereby contributing to risk for preterm 
birth. In Aims 1 and 2, we will use human placental villous explants to establish concentration-dependent and 
time-dependent relationships for the phthalate and TCE metabolites (Aim 1), and test whether oxidative stress 
initiates tissue function disruption by these toxicants (Aim 2). Because infection of the placenta and EPM is the 
leading identifiable cause of preterm birth, in Aim 3 we will probe oxidative stress as a mechanism by which 
toxicants modify susceptibility of EPM to Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection. The proposed studies will 
expand knowledge of phthalate and TCE toxicity to placenta and EPM, providing new insights into stimulation 
of oxidative stress and inhibition of gestational tissue resistance to bacterial infection as biological mechanisms 
by which environmental contaminant exposures increase risk for preterm birth. By working with primary human 
tissue culture models relevant to late preterm birth – which accounts for most of the increase in preterm births 
in the United States – these findings have the potential for translation to medical and public health 
interventions with a significant impact on reducing preterm births."

The vision of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) is to develop collaborative approaches for data management and sharing through inclusion of established generalist repositories in the NIH data ecosystem and better enable search and discovery of NIH funded data in the generalist repositories. This is one of the steps in the modernization of the data resources ecosystem and aligns with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science.
The primary mission of the Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative is to establish a common set of cohesive and consistent capabilities, services, metrics, and social infrastructure across various generalist repositories. A secondary mission is to also raise general awareness and facilitate researchers to adopt FAIR principles to better share and reuse data.
The objectives of the project are to work together with the other awardee teams to develop a “co-opetition plan” that include a commitment to a solution architecture, data submission and QA/QC capabilities to support relevant use cases, train and educate users, as well as provide usage analytics and reporting to the NIH."
10920356,"The exploration and discovery of living systems has been greatly aided by modern protein tools. These
tools pervade many fields of biology, from the sub-cellular scale to the cellular scale to the systems scale.
Bioengineers have made substantial progress in expanding the functionality and enhancing the performance of
these protein tools, but progress is slow due to the community's limited understanding of how a protein's
sequence relates to a protein's function.
 A long-term goal of the community is to develop a more detailed understanding of the sequence-function
relationship. This understanding will allow the field to intelligently predict, design, and identify high-performing
protein tools. The technical challenge to accessing the detailed sequence-function relationship is the inability to
densely sample the large landscape of potential protein sequences: there are approaching infinite possibilities
of placing any of the twenty amino acids in the hundreds to thousands of residue positions of a protein. A typical
lab may screen a small portion of this landscape with a limited number of mutations scattered throughout the
protein or targeted to key regions of the protein. Even during these screens, limitations in the scale of resources
needed to functionally assess individual protein variants or sequence individual variants hinder full access to the
sequence-function relationship. The typical lab either functionally screens candidates in detail or sequences the
candidates in detail, but not both. This incomplete matching between functional information and sequence
information in turn prevents accurate predictions that improve protein function.
 The immediate goal of this proposal is to create an optical screening technology that explores the detailed
protein fitness landscape with full sequence and function information on a scale 1-2 orders larger than the scale
of existing screens. We will achieve this scale by using optical imaging to perform both the functional assessment
and sequencing in situ. We will develop such a technology across 3 aims: (1) We will optically quantify the
function of a library of fluorescent protein mutants on large scales within a culture well. (2) In the same well, we
will optically sequence individual mutants using recently-developed commercial chemistries and a barcode
lookup system. Because the sequencing and functional assessment occur in the same well, we will develop the
relationship between sequence and function at the resolution of single protein variants. (3) We will develop a
pipeline of image processing techniques that automatically and accurately segment individual cells and calls the
bases within each cell footprint throughout the culture well. If successful, the combination of our three aims will
enable a typical lab to screen protein tools on large scales with full sequence and function information. We expect
our technology to take advantage of existing commodity goods and translate easily from lab to lab. The increased
scale and open-source nature of the proposed technology can then broadly impact the protein tool development
community."

Coenzyme Q (CoQ, aka ubiquinone) is an important component of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain (ETC) as well as a membrane-incorporated antioxidant and a
co-factor for redox processes outside the mitochondria. CoQ deficiencies can be caused
by hereditary mutations in the biosynthesis pathway but are also associated with aging,
chronic diseases such as Type-2 Diabetes, and the pharmacological use of HMGCoA
inhibitors (statins). Due to the complexities of inter-organ communication, it has been
difficult to dissect the tissue specific effects of CoQ deficiencies and to identify primary
metabolic alterations. Since non-shivering thermogenesis heavily relies on mitochondrial
function and mitochondria-rich brown adipose tissue (BAT), we hypothesize that this
tissue will be disproportionately affected by CoQ deficiencies and have generated BAT
specific CoQ deficiency models both in vitro (pharmacological inhibition of CoQ
synthesis) and in vivo (UCP1-cre driven deletion of the CoQ biosynthetic enzyme
PDSS2). Indeed, we find that BAT CoQ deficiency from diminished de novo synthesis
within BAT results in tissue dysfunction and cold sensitivity. Interestingly, we find that the
primary mitochondrial defect in both pharmacological and genetic models of CoQ
deficiency appears not to be a decline in maximal mitochondrial respiration capacity but
a rapid down regulation of UCP1 expression and function. RNAseq data reveal a
transcriptional signature of CoQ deficiency in BAT that involves key regulators of the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and the integrated stress response
(ISR). We propose that activation of the IRS in BAT triggers metabolic adaptations
including decreased UCP1 expression and enhanced UCP1-independent
thermogenesis, in BAT and other tissues, via increased secretion of BAT para/autocrine
factors such as FGF21."
10773020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent element of many leading causes of disability, namely cerebrovascular
and neurodegenerative diseases. The function and stability of mitochondria are tightly regulated by the
mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control (QC). The dynamic nature of mitochondria is
maintained by the balancing forces of fission and fusion. These processes of mitochondrial dynamics operate to
preserve the functional architecture of the mitochondrial network. The mechanisms of mitochondrial QC,
including mitophagy, proteostasis, and biogenesis, work to regulate the components of the mitochondrial network
through synthesis and degradation. These forces actively control the functionality of the mitochondrial network
to ensure efficient energy production. In cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, the processes of mitochondrial
dynamics and QC become dysregulated, contributing to metabolic dysfunction and neurological damage. The
F99 phase of this proposal aims to identify the phases of disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and QC in cerebral
I/R injury, and their respective molecular mechanisms. Utilizing advanced technologies related to machine
learning, computational modeling, and live cell imaging, I have created an agent-based model of mitochondrial
dynamics for these investigations. This model allows for the simulation of the dynamic actions of individual
mitochondrial units to culminate in the complex patterns normally observed in mammalian cells. Live cell imaging
of mouse primary cortical neurons from novel transgenic reporter lines (i.e., MitoTimer, MitoQC) and conditional
knockout lines will be utilized to observe the respective contributions of individual dynamics proteins to the
patterns of mitochondrial morphology. Knockout neurons will be exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD),
an in vitro model of I/R injury, and mitochondrial parameters (i.e., morphology, oxidation) will be imaged in real
time to generate a mechanistic timeline of mitochondrial dynamics. These live cell recordings will be used to
optimize and expand our agent-based model to allow for in silico experimental manipulation of mitochondrial
proteins. Our expanded model will have the ability to test hypotheses regarding the basal and pathological rates
of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control, as well as inform future experiments with decreased costs and
increased efficiency. In the K00 phase of this proposal, I will transition from studying mitochondrial quality control
in I/R to its study in neurodegeneration. Utilizing the technical skills acquired in the predoctoral phase, I will
investigate age-related changes in mitochondrial proteostasis and critical long-lived mitochondrial proteins at the
synapse. The K00 phase aims to determine how aging affects the turnover of synaptic mitochondrial proteins,
with specific emphasis on the roles of intramitochondrial proteostasis and the integrated stress response. I intend
to determine the contribution of mitochondrial proteostasis to synaptic stability and related neurodegeneration.
This work has significant implications in aging and neurodegeneration research, as synaptic loss and
mitochondrial dysfunction are both hallmarks of age-related neurological diseases."
10832460,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mammalian cells must move and proliferate to maintain and regenerate tissues and defend themselves against
pathogens, but mutations that increase movement or proliferation can also cause cancer. Stem, progenitor, and
differentiated cells are often non-motile and quiescent but keep integrating cell-cell contacts, cell-matrix contacts,
and receptor inputs, and make two distinct decisions (that are often connected) whether they should start to
move and start to proliferate if needed. Several challenges have prevented an understanding of these two
decision processes. Genetic approaches in animals cannot readily tackle the co-regulation of large numbers of
signaling processes while biochemical analysis of cultured cells often leads to inconclusive results due to the
difficulty to synchronize cells and resolve when and where in a cell signaling occurs. Only single cell analysis
can resolve the spatial and temporal signaling feedbacks controlling these complex decisions. Our laboratory
has developed critically needed fluorescent single-cell activity reporters, rapid perturbation strategies, and
automated microscopy and analysis methods to investigate these two fundamental decision processes.
 To understand the decision to polarize and move, we will use the new tools we developed to explore how
external receptor tyrosine kinase signals and cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts synergistically control the initiation
and maintenance of gradients in cell signaling and actin organization, and how cells locally direct the signaling
gradients and movement. To understand the decision to proliferate, we will investigate the competition
mechanism that determines how these same signal inputs at the plasma membrane control the activation of two
cyclin-Cdk kinase activities in the nucleus, explore how cells control a proliferation decision process that can still
be reversed for many hours before cells commit to proliferate much later, and resolve how this same decision
process coordinates the licensing of origins of replication and DNA replication to prevent genome instability and
cell death. The outcome of our work will be a quantitative, molecular, and mechanistic understanding of how
mammalian cells integrate signals to make decisions to start to move and proliferate, and how mutations that
dysregulate these proliferation and migration decisions can cause cancer and other diseases."
10829275,"X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (also known as SBMA or Kennedy's disease) is a
rare neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset proximal muscle weakness due to
lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA patients display signs of androgen insensitivity,
including gynecomastia, reduced fertility, and testicular atrophy. SBMA, is caused by a CAG-
polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and is one member
of a family of nine CAG-polyQ repeat disorders that includes Huntington’s disease. For
decades, research into the basis of neurological disease focused upon the contribution of
neuronal dysfunction to disease pathogenesis. However, over the last ten years, there has been
growing evidence in the motor neuron disease field that challenges the prevailing neurocentric
theory of the etiology of many neurological diseases. . In the case of SBMA, there is increasing
evidence implicating muscle dysfunction as a major component of disease pathogenesis. For
therapeutic purposes, however, different groups have demonstrated successful treatments
targeting either the skeletal muscles or the central nervous system using different SBMA animal
models. Consequently, this lack of consensus in the literature underscores the need for studies
of the SBMA AR-mutation on affected cell types - skeletal muscles and motor neurons - in a
human background. We hypothesized that polyQ mutation cause disruption in AR binding to the
DNA which leads to transcriptional dysregulation that can be pathogenic in motor neurons,
skeletal muscles or both. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to combine AR genome wide
occupancy and gene expression data sets generated from SBMA and CRISPR engineered
isogenic controls iPSC-derived skeletal muscle and motor neurons. We will then, co-culture the
iPSC-derived skeletal muscles with iPSC-derived motor neurons to modulate the AR targets
identified in the AR transcriptional network and investigate neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) by
analyzing electrophysiological activity of the motor neurons and the skeletal muscles. This work
will advance understanding on the molecular mechanisms of human mutant AR to SBMA
pathogenesis and evaluate the utility of iPSC-derived skeletal muscles and motor neurons tool
to develop SBMA in vitro studies."

Alcohol use and alcohol use disorders (AUD) in adolescents and young adults with autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) have been considered rare by mental health professionals. This
conclusion has primarily been based on clinical experience as the empirical literature on alcohol
and other drug (AOD) use in the US is virtually nonexistent. Scandinavian health registry studies
suggest AOD use is lower in the ASD population overall compared to the general public. Clinical
studies also indicate lower rates of AOD in persons diagnosed with ASD compared to persons
diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, rates of AOD use as high as 30% have
been reported in the ASD population. In addition, there appear to be subgroups of persons with
ASD, such as those with co-occurring Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with
substantial rates of AOD use and AUDs that not only rival persons with other psychiatric
disorders, but also indicate a need for proper identification and, when indicated, treatment.
Importantly, prevalence estimates for ASD have increased in the past 10-20 years and a large
proportion of that increase includes individuals with higher cognitive and language functioning.
This subset of the ASD population is more likely to be included in and exposed to normative
educational and social contexts, increasing risk for AOD use. The literature strongly supports
the need for detailed and reliable information on the prevalence of AOD in a representative
sample of adolescents and young adults with ASD in the US. In this application, we propose to
assess a large, well-characterized, population-based ASD sample (Rhode Island Consortium for
Autism Research and Treatment- RI-CART) that will enable us to provide, by far, the most in-
depth characterization of AOD use and AUD prevalence in the ASD population in the US, as
well as data regarding AOD onset and rate of progression to more severe use and AUDs.
Equally important is the need to verify, or refute, risk and protective factors for AOD in this
population. We will examine comorbid conditions, with specific focus on ADHD and anxiety
disorders. We will also characterize the factors inducing risk of AOD use at critical junctions for
adolescents and young adults with ASD, such as the transition to independent living, which is
often associated with greater peer contact and less structure and social control. We propose to
study a subsample of RI-CART participants (N=410) age 12-24 years, who either have an IQ ≥
85 or an IQ ≥ 75 and are verbally fluent, in a 4-wave longitudinal, cohort-sequential study. We
will examine AOD use in relation to age, as well as in relation to key developmental transitions
(e.g., into and from high school, into supervised living or independent living/college)."

cooperative spirit we have garnered working with tribal schools and communities in
Nebraska and South Dakota. We will develop, implement, and evaluate science
curriculum, outreach activities, and training experiences targeting Native American
students and their teachers in grades K-12. The long-term goals of this project are to
promote student interest in the sciences, foster a more science-literate public,
and ultimately to increase the number of Native Americans entering health and
science careers. Improving science and math instruction in the classrooms serving our
Native American partners is key to this project. This objective will be accomplished by
creating and adapting hands-on, age-appropriate lessons. Through summer workshops,
mentoring, and in-service education, teacher support will facilitate the implementation of
novel science and math education strategies for use in tribal schools. Student
engagement will be enhanced through summer experiences from science camps for
middle school to longer-term enrichment programs for select high school students.
Reaching beyond the classroom to parents and communities is also critical to the
success of this project. Community programs will be designed to give parents and
elders the sense of excitement that students feel when doing science. Ancillary benefits
will include promoting educational opportunities, healthy living, and improving health
literacy. Professional evaluations will be made at all stages, with major emphasis being
placed on evaluating the educational and community impact of the project. Research
techniques will include baseline and post measures of attitudes and subject content,
participant evaluation questionnaires, and student retrospective pretests. Advancing the
health of Native American communities is the ultimate aim of every aspect of this
project. Improved science teaching and heightened awareness of health careers will
encourage students to enter these careers and hope to bring these skills back to their
communities. Public outreach that increases health literacy and healthy living will
promote better personal health decisions."

cell resistance to newly developed mTOR inhibitors such that their future use may be optimized

activated upon mTOR inhibitor exposure allowing tumor cell survival in the face of global
inhibition of protein synthesis. These experiments will delineate the molecular mechanisms

an FDA-approved drug as a small molecule inhibitor targeting this pathway for synergistic

Treatment outcomes of HIV-positive youth in Uganda and elsewhere are threatened by low medication
adherence. Despite the clear need for adherence support among youth, few interventions target this
particularly vulnerable group during a time of heightened risk-taking behavior and unfinished development of
cognitive control processes such as planning and goal-directed behavior. Incentives informed by behavioral
economics (BE) have successfully changed a range of health behaviors by countering present bias (the
tendency of overly discounting the future benefits of preventive health behaviors) including our own study that
improved ART adherence. However, they have rarely been tested among youth living with HIV (YLWH) who
are likely to particularly benefit from such extrinsic rewards given their observed problems with self-control.
Traditional incentives that require individuals to reach a uniform, high eligible threshold by design leave out
those unable to meet it, often most in need of support. In a pilot study, we tested a novel incentive design that
allowed even those with low initial adherence to qualify for incentives, resulting in their improved adherence.
BE theory suggests that the effort exerted to reach a goal depends on how far away it is from the participant; if
the goal is within close reach, the participant shows great willingness to achieve it, but if the goal is set too
high, s/he becomes demotivated and may give up. Based on this insight, we restructured our incentive design
to allow participants to set their own eligibility threshold. We propose to build on our pilot results using a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to establish effectiveness. Our intervention, GOALS, proposes testing
externally assigned sub-goals gradually increasing towards 90% (T1, n=140) and self-chosen, participatory
interim goals (T2, n=140), against a traditional, fixed goal of 90% (T3, n=140). The control group (n=140) will
receive the usual standard of care. The primary outcome is electronically measured ART adherence collected
throughout the study and for 12 months after incentives are withdrawn to measure the persistence of behavior
change; suppressed viral load will be the secondary outcome. The Specific Aims in year 1 (Improvement
Phase) is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the three incentivization approaches for improving adherence
among YLWH. In year 2 (Maintenance Phase), we test the relative effectiveness of the three ways of
incentivization for maintaining adherence. In year 3 (Persistence Phase) the goal is to investigate for 12
months the relative effectiveness of the three GOALS intervention arms at creating behavioral persistence
once incentives are removed. Specific Aim 4 is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis including a
comparative analysis of those GOALS intervention arms that show a positive intervention impact for improving
and/or maintaining adherence."

There is currently no vaccine in clinical use to combat group A streptococcal infection, despite
the considerable global burden of acute and chronic disease attributable to this pathogen.
The long-term goal of this work is the development of a combination vaccine that can combat
group A streptococcal pharyngitis worldwide, without risk of vaccine escape, in order to eradicate
future cases of rheumatic heart disease and reduce the risk of invasive infections.
The objective of this proposal is to use self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) technology to identify the
optimum combination of antigens to include in a new, broad-acting group A streptococcal saRNA
vaccine that protects against experimental nasopharyngeal and soft tissue infection.
Adults are broadly immune to group A streptococcal pharyngitis, whereas younger children are
highly susceptible. The rationale for our approach, is that understanding adult immunity to group
A streptococcus will directly inform the requirements for immunity in children. Pooled
immunoglobulin donated by adults contains antibodies that promote clearance of group A
streptococcus, both in human blood and in experimental models. Having identified and ranked
the antigenic targets of these antibodies, this project will use saRNA to evaluate each antigen
alone, and in combination. The specific aims are: (1) Develop saRNA constructs that express the
new panel of streptococcal antigens. (2) Rank individual saRNA antigens based on protective
efficacy in experimental murine soft tissue infection challenge and in nasopharyngeal infection
challenge. (3) Evaluate second order interactions between top-ranking saRNA antigens via paired
combinations in soft tissue and nasopharyngeal models of infection. (4) Predict the optimum
combination of up to 5 saRNA antigens to combat nasopharyngeal infection, using computer-
assisted modelling and test the optimized combination in vivo, using standard and humanized
murine models of infection, as well as following nasal immunization.
Deliverables from the work will be an optimized combination saRNA vaccine that provides
protection from experimental group A streptococcal infection, and a methodology to advance
combination vaccine discovery in the future. The longer-term impact on human health would
be considerable: Elimination of group A streptococcal pharyngitis would reduce antimicrobial
consumption, reduce the health and socio-economic burden of streptococcal disease, reduce
future cases of invasive streptococcal infection and rheumatic heart disease and therefore
reduce global mortality from this infection."
10804704,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly a thousand children are diagnosed each year with Neuroblastoma (NBL) in the United States, and
this cancer is, by far, the most prevalent type in infants. Sadly, high-risk NBL, which comprises ~70% of
all NBL cases, has a five-year survival rate of <50%. High-risk NBL is characterized by having
amplification of the MYCN gene and deletion of the 1p36 (D1p36) region of chromosome one, which
houses multiple tumor suppressors. But these signatures are difficult to exploit as pharmacologic
inhibition of MYCN has proven elusive, and re-activating tumor suppressor gene expression after
genomic loss is virtually impossible. Consistent with MYCN’s established role in increasing global
transcription, high-risk NBLs with amplified MYCN expression are uniquely dependent on the cellular
transcription and RNA processing apparatus. Among this machinery vital to MYCN function is the
Integrator Complex, which is responsible for UsnRNA biosynthesis essential for co-transcriptional splicing
and promoting RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) turnover and plasticity. Integrator is a 14-membered complex
associated with RNAPII and is fundamental in regulating transcriptional output. My laboratory has been
investigating the molecular mechanism of Integrator for over ten years(19-34), and we have found that
Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11) is the critical enzymatic component of the complex. INTS11 utilizes its
RNA endonuclease activity to cleave the 3'-end of spliceosomal UsnRNA and is thus required for pre-
mRNA splicing. Moreover, we recently found that INTS11 is also necessary to cleave nascent protein-
coding RNA to promote RNAPII recycling. Both functions are critical to support high transcription
observed when MYCN is overproduced. Beyond being required in MYCN-amplified tumors, the most
attractive feature nominating Integrator as a potential druggable target in NBL is that the INTS11 gene is
located within 1p36 and is frequently deleted in NBLs. In support of this observation, data from DEPMAP
reveals that NBL cell lines are highly sensitive to partial depletion of INTS11, indicating a unique and
robust dependency on this gene. Altogether, these observations support a hypothesis that INTS11
represents a novel and unexplored target in NBL (Fig. 1), and our Specific Aims below are designed to
test this directly. Specific Aim 1. Determine the sensitivity of MYCN-amplified and D1p36 NBL cell lines
to INTS11 downregulation. Specific Aim 2. Test candidate inhibitors of INTS11 for differential toxicity in
high-risk NBL cell lines."
10745737,"Our proposal aims to improve and individualize the treatment of early-stage breast cancer in women aged 65
years and older with a novel use of a three-month course of pre-operative endocrine therapy (pre-ET). Early-
stage breast cancer is traditionally treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant radiation
therapy (RT) and a 5- to10-year course of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET). Long-term data from two
randomized controlled trials demonstrate that omission of RT in older women with estrogen receptor positive,
early-stage breast cancer who are treated with AET does not result in a decreased survival. However, over
70% of women still receive RT, due in part to physician and patient reluctance to omit a treatment in light of
concerns about AET toxicity and adherence. Optimal choices for older breast cancer patients require
considering data-based recommendations, life expectancy, co-morbidities and patient preferences. We will
evaluate the use of pre-ET as a novel experiential tool to inform adjuvant therapy decisions, predict long-term
AET adherence and to reduce decisional conflict and regret, addressing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To
assess whether pre-ET changes patients’ and treating physicians’ preference for adjuvant RT. This test
exposure will provide patients with the information they need to choose among the treatment options after
BCS. We hypothesize that a 3-month course of pre-ET will reduce patients’ and physicians’ preferences for
adjuvant RT by 10% from baseline preferences. We will also assess whether patient-reported outcomes during
pre-ET predict AET adherence at 2 years. We will obtain exploratory data on tumor response to pre-ET by
evaluating tumor proliferation indices before and after pre-ET. Aim 2: To measure the effect of pre-ET on
decisional outcomes for adjuvant therapy after BCS. We will apply the Ottawa Decision Support
Framework to evaluate the effects of a trial of endocrine therapy on decisional conflict and decisional regret,
framing pre-ET as a decision support intervention. We will measure decisional regret at 1 and 2 years after
BCS. We hypothesize that pre-ET will reduce decisional conflict and regret, and that decisional conflict and
regret scores will be associated with 1- and 2-year adherence to AET. The use of pre-ET in the proposal
represents a patient-centered treatment approach and may ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in the way that
early-stage breast cancer is treated in older women, allowing for optimization assignment of adjuvant therapy,
increased adherence to planned treatment regimens and decreased decisional regret."

hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), largely due to their ability to function across MHC barriers
without causing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)1. gd T-cells can be readily expanded in vitro and in vivo using
zoledronate (ZOL) and have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in preclinical and early phase clinical trials, but
their efficacy against CD19-expressing tumors including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL) has been modest3. Recently, CD19 CAR gd T-cells were found to have profound effects against
CD19+ tumors in vitro and in xenogeneic mice, albeit inferior to CD19 CAR ab T-cells, although CD19 CAR gd
T-cells were more effective at eliminating CD19 negative escape variants5, 6. As such, if the natural cytotoxicity
of gd T-cells could be enhanced they would become a highly attractive “off the shelf” therapeutic option for ALL
and NHL. Our goal is to improve gd T-cell therapeutics by collecting “superior” gd T-cells that have been mobilized
to peripheral blood by exercise or a synthetic b2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist and arming them with a CAR.
We will build on several novel and important observations we have made: (i) a single exercise bout
instantaneously mobilizes gd T-cells bearing a cytotoxic, co-stimulatory and tissue migration phenotype, allowing
their ex vivo manufacture with ZOL+IL-2 to increase by 100-300%4; (ii) exercise expanded gd T-cells have higher
in vitro cytotoxicity against several hematologic tumors4 and are more capable of inhibiting K562 leukemic growth
in xenogeneic mice, particularly when combined with ZOL sensitization; (iii) exercise skews expanded gd T-cells
toward an activated phenotype with heightened NKG2D, TRAIL, DNAM-1 and lowered NKG2A expression, and
blocking these activating receptors, or their ligands on K562 cells, abrogates the exercise effects on gd T-cell
cytotoxicity; and (iv) the mobilization of these superior gd T-cells with exercise is driven by b2-AR activation4. We
hypothesize that exercise will also enhance the quality of CAR gd T-cells by mobilizing gd T-cells with sustained
activation of cytotoxicity, co-stimulation, oxidative phosphorylation, homing and proliferation related genes, and
that this mobilization will be precipitated by increased cAMP signaling. Our aims are: 1) Determine if a single
exercise bout can improve the quality of CAR gd T-cells expanded from healthy donors. 2) Explore the
transcriptomic basis for the enhanced expansion and cytotoxicity of exercise mobilized gd T-cells and expanded
products. 3) Identify the b2-AR signaling pathways responsible for mobilizing gd T-cells with enhanced expansion
and cytotoxicity potential. Our approach involves the use flow cytometry, xenogeneic mouse models, single cell
RNA sequencing, and comparisons with CD19 CAR ab T-cells in human trials involving exercise with b-blockers
and b-agonist infusion models. We expect these aims to identify underpinning mechanisms and pave the way
for a clinical trial whereby exercise/b-agonist mobilized gd T-cells can be collected from donors and cancer
patients to increase the potency of CAR T-cell therapies to treat refractory disease and relapse after HSCT."

Chronic Toxoplasma gondii infections are widespread and their reactivation can cause life-threatening disease in
immunocompromised individuals and recurrent ocular lesions in the immunocompetent. The recently identified
master regulator of chronic differentiation, BFD1, provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the
molecular events that establish and maintain chronic T. gondii infections. BFD1 is necessary for chronic
differentiation in cell culture and in mouse models of infection, and its expression is sufficient to induce chronic
differentiation. Consistent with a sustained requirement for BFD1 during chronic stage maintenance, the
differentiation program is reversed upon conditional down-regulation of BFD1. Preliminary results indicate that BFD1
is post-transcriptionally controlled through its 5′ UTR, leading to the hypothesis that translational regulation of BFD1
is fundamental to the development and maintenance of chronic T. gondii stages. This proposal seeks to integrate
BFD1 into a broader regulatory network through three complementary aims. Aim 1 will examine the sequence
elements, secondary RNA structures, and ribosomal occupancy dynamics that mediate BFD1 translational
regulation. Aim 2 will use conditional depletion of BFD1 to characterize transcriptional and proteomic changes that
mediate reactivation, and the molecular circuits that maintain the differentiated state. Finally, Aim 3 will extend the
regulatory pathways that control differentiation by screening for genes involved in the translational regulation of BFD1
and further examining the function of transcription factors directly regulated by BFD1. The overarching goal of this
comprehensive analysis is to understand the conditions that promote chronic differentiation and license the
development of curative therapies against toxoplasmosis."
10827934,"This is a MERIT extension of R37 AI075039. In the previous funding period we addressed the fundamental
mechanisms by which pathogen-encoded virulence activities are detected by the innate immune system.
We focused on an innate immune sensor called the NLRP1 inflammasome. This sensor was known to be
activated by a protease toxin, called lethal factor (LF), that is secreted by the bacterial pathogen Bacillus
anthracis. We demonstrated that LF activates NLRP1 by direct proteolytic cleavage of NLRP1. We found
that this cleavage results in the N-end rule-dependent degradation of NLPR1 by the proteasome.
Unexpectedly, however, we found that LF-induced degradation does not inactivate NLRP1. Instead, we
found that NLRP1 underwent “functional degradation”, a unique process by which the signaling competent
C-terminal CARD domain of NLRP1 was released and thereby able to undergo oligomerization and
inflammasome formation. Our work identifying the molecular basis by which NLRP1 is able to sense
pathogen-encoded enzymatic activity led us to ask whether NLRP1 might sense additional pathogen-
encoded activities and, moreover, whether additional pathogen-encoded effectors might be detected by
other innate immune sensors. Indeed, we discovered that a pathogen-encoded ubiquitin E3 ligase called
IpaH7.8, secreted into host cells by the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri, is also sensed by NLRP1. In
the extension period, we propose to continue to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the
enzymatic activities of pathogen-encoded virulence factors are detected by the innate immune system. We
are conducting screens to identify novel virulence factors that stimulate host immune responses. We will
then conduct mechanistic studies to identify the sensors of these virulence factors and the molecular basis
of sensor activation. Together our studies will illuminate fundamental molecular mechanisms by which
pathogens are sensed by the innate immune system.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Human health depends on the accurate and sensitive detection of pathogenic microbes by the innate
immune system. We propose to determine fundamental mechanisms by which the virulence activities of
bacterial pathogens are sensed by the innate immune system."

The γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABABR) and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to
the Family C of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and critically regulate neuronal excitability, synaptic
transmission and plasticity. Many disorders of the CNS have been linked to alterations in neuronal excitability
via the glutamatergic and GABAergic system. Accordingly, mGluRs and GABABR have been the subject of an
enormous drug discovery effort as they represent major therapeutic targets for treating numerous physiological
dysfunctions and for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Apart from the prototypical seven
transmembrane helix (7TM) domain, Family C GPCRs also include a large extracellular ‘venus fly trap’ (VFT)
domain that constitutes the orthosteric ligand binding site. Binding of ligand to the extracellular VFT domain
triggers a large conformational change in the VFT domains from an open to a closed conformation. This clam-
shell like closure of the extracellular domain results in receptor engagement and activation of G proteins on the
intracellular side of the transmembrane domain with a mechanism that remains unclear. Receptor activated G
proteins then act to either enhance or repress secondary messenger signaling cascades. We recently showed
cryoEM structures of near-full length mGluR5 and GABABR in inactive and active conformations, revealing
extensive transitions in the organization of the 7TM dimer upon ligand binding to the VFT. Notwithstanding this
progress, several key questions remain regarding the allosteric communication across the cell membrane by
Family C GPCRs, and particularly the mechanism of G protein coupling and activation. To address these
questions, we propose to obtain the structures of mGluR2, mGluR5 and GABABR in complex with their cognate
G proteins and probe the structural insights using molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis coupled to
functional assays. The similarities and differences amongst these receptor-G protein complexes will allow us to
contrast and compare our findings and examine aspects of G protein coupling and selectivity. Collectively,
these studies will enable us to create a detailed mechanistic framework to understand Family C GPCR
signaling and will form the basis for the design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these receptors."

Intestinal health relies on the homeostatic function of intestinal macrophages in controlling gut inflammation.
Defects in establishing this macrophage function can lead to unresolved inflammation as seen in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent studies have highlighted the impact of tissue microenvironments on
establishing macrophage tissue-specific functions. Of specific interest, metabolites produced by gut bacteria,
such as short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids, exert profound immunomodulatory effects on
macrophage functional polarization. They suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and transform
macrophages to anti-inflammatory phenotype. What remains lacking, however, is the knowledge of how
macrophages sense bacterial metabolites and mediate their immunomodulatory effects, especially in the gut
microenvironment. Cellular metabolism regulates macrophage functions. We have previously demonstrated that
macrophage pro-inflammatory response can be regulated by controlling metabolic substrate uptake. We
therefore propose that metabolite sensing in macrophages is mediated via coordinated expression of transport
proteins, which transport specific metabolites across plasma membranes and allow them to integrate into
intracellular metabolism or to be directly sensed by intracellular receptors. Our long-term goal is to identify
transporter targets that promote bacterial metabolite sensing and macrophage homeostatic function in order to
control intestinal inflammation. Our preliminary data have indicated that macrophages exhibit distinct transporter
reprogramming during functional polarization. There, we identified that SLCO3A1, an organic anion transporter
and a recently discovered IBD-associated gene, is specifically upregulated during macrophage pro-inflammatory
activation. Overexpression of SLCO3A1 enhances bile acid uptake. Also, the expression of SLCO3A1 is specific
for tissue-resident macrophages from both small and large intestines as compared to other tissue-resident
macrophages. Based on these observations, the overall goal of this project is to define the role of macrophage
SLCO3A1 in metabolite sensing and intestinal tissue homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that the expression
of SLCO3A1 in macrophages facilitates the sensing of bacterial metabolites that promotes macrophage
homeostatic function and the prevention of IBD. This project will focus on the following specific aims: (1) Define
the mechanism by which SLCO3A1 regulates bile acid sensing and its immunosuppressive effect in
macrophages. (2) Determine the role of SLCO3A1 in intestinal macrophages and the development of IBD.
Altogether, this project will elucidate the mechanisms by which SLCO3A1 regulates the sensing of bacterial
metabolites and promotes the homeostatic function of macrophages in controlling intestinal inflammation. We
believe that completion of this project will provide mechanistic insights into important principles that govern the
macrophage metabolite sensing in the intestinal microenvironment and the prevention of IBD."
10798308,"Abstract: Nonsense mutations change an amino acid codon to a premature termination codon (PTC), resulting
in a defective truncated protein and severe forms of disease. Nonsense mutations account for greater than ten
percent of all genetic diseases, accounting for nearly 1,000 genetic human disorders, including cystic fibrosis
(CF). Indeed, 10% of people with CF have nonsense mutations (Type 1 mutations) that lead to premature
truncation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and significant loss of
transcripts due to nonsense mediated decay (NMD). The most common nonsense mutations include G542X,
R553X, R1162X and W1282X, which account for 10% of all CF nonsense mutations, result in loss of CFTR
function and the most severe CF phenotypes. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel whose absence in CF
alters normal homeostasis of lung lining fluid, resulting in highly viscous mucus that allows bacterial infection
and ultimately lethal infections. Correction of between 10 and 15% of the mutant CFTR in the lung is predicted
to be the threshold for effective treatment of the disease. While aminoglycosides and non-aminoglycoside small-
molecules have been developed and allow readthrough of PTCs, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with extended
use in the case of aminoglycosides and poor activity for the other drugs has restricted their use clinically. We
have recently developed a library of Anti-Codon Edited (ACE)-tRNAs that recognize and promote read-through
of all `in-frame' PTCs. Each of the ACE-tRNAs has a single site mutation that recognizes the PTC but the ACE-
tRNA is charged with an amino acid to readthrough the PTC. We have taken advantage of the small tRNA
expression cassette (~72 bp), and generated several compact DNA vectors, we call minivectors. With a library
of >500 ACE-tRNAs, we can insert any desired amino acid into any PTC. We have shown that this approach
works with high efficiency both in vitro and in vivo in rescuing PTC-containing luminescent reporter genes, as
well as G542X-, R1162X- and W1282X-CFTR within the genomic context in CRISPRed 16HBE14o- cells leading
to correction of both NMD and CFTR protein function. Our goal is to test the efficacy, persistence of action and
safety of ACE-tRNAs delivered as minivectors for PTC readthrough and correction in human airway epithelial
PTC cell culture models and in vivo in lung of pig and CFTR PTC mutant mice. To deliver these ACE-tRNA to
the lungs of mice and pigs, we will use transthoracic electroporation which has been shown to be safe, simple,
and highly efficient at gene delivery to the lung, including the airways. The overarching goal is to determine the
therapeutic promise of ACE-tRNAs for treatment of nonsense associated diseases."

 Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical reactions for the synthesis of compounds that could be used
as medicines. We will build upon our expertise in the synthesis of cyclic peroxides, a family of natural products
that exhibit a broad range of biological activities, suggesting their application to the treatment of malaria, cancer,
and viral and bacterial infections. During the proposed funding period, we will investigate our hypothesis that
initiation of ferroptosis is a general property of cyclic peroxides, and we will optimize the potency and metabolic
stability of FINO2, a cyclic peroxide we developed that initiates cell death by a new mechanism. The target of
FINO2 is unknown so we will study the mechanism by which cyclic peroxides like FINO2 initiate programmed cell
death, in collaboration with Professor Brent Stockwell (Columbia University). We will also develop new methods
for the synthesis of the cyclic peroxide structural motif found in many naturally occurring peroxides. We will also
investigate the synthesis of aromatic peroxides, a structural class whose synthesis and reactivity have not been
addressed. In the proposed funding period, we will also extend our investigations of mechanisms of acetal
substitution reactions, which are important methods in natural product synthesis and carbohydrate chemistry.
Using systematic studies of model systems, we can identify the factors that contribute to the stability and
reactivity of oxocarbenium ions, which are intermediates involved in many of the reactions of carbohydrates,
including enzymatic reactions. We will determine how the carboxyl group in sugars such as sialic acids influence
the stereoselectivity of reactions involving these sugars. We will demonstrate remote neighboring-group
participation as a means of controlling stereoselectivity in cyclic and acyclic compounds. The proposed research
is innovative because it addresses structural types and reactive intermediates that have received little attention
in the literature. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to new pathways for making biologically
active compounds and will provide deeper mechanistic understanding of chemical and biological processes.
These studies are relevant to human health because they could result in drugs that kill cells by unique pathways,
leading to new treatments for various diseases. Furthermore, the mechanistic understanding of intermediates
involved in reactions of carbohydrates could lead to new ways of designing enzyme inhibitors."

Opiate use, dependence, and addiction have dramatically increased to epidemic proportions in recent years.
This is a reflection of the increased misuse of prescription opioids and abuse of illegal opiate drugs, such as
heroin. Unfortunately, there are still relatively few effective pharmacotherapeutic interventions available for the
treatment of substance abuse and addiction, most of which rely on a replacement therapeutic model.
 Neuronal plasticity is considered to be a substrate that mediates the long-lasting changes in the brain's
reward circuit and a key component of the long-term addiction disease state. These neural adaptations occur in
brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens and lead to long-term drug craving and drug relapse. Currently,
there is a scarcity of mechanistic evidence that explores the molecular mechanisms of heroin-induced structural
plasticity. The overarching focus of this proposal is to determine the functional cellular neurobiological
mechanisms of heroin-induced behavioral plasticity.
 The proposed studies investigate the role of actin dynamics mediated through the actin-binding protein
drebrin in heroin-induced plasticity, ultimately resulting in long-term drug craving and relapse behaviors. To this
end, we have proposed three Specific Aims that will test the following hypotheses: to determine if heroin self-
administration results in a persistent and epigenetically-mediated decrease in the actin-stabilizing protein
drebrin, which in turn regulates actin turnover (Aim I); to determine that drebrin is an essential molecular
mechanism underlying heroin-induced relapse-like behaviors and structural plasticity following abstinence from
heroin self-administration (Aim II); and to determine if drebrin mediates drug seeking and structural plasticity in
D1- and in D2-expressing medium spiny neurons following heroin self-administration (Aim III).
 This application presents an opportunity to determine, for the first time, a causal mechanism—drebrin—in the
underlying cellular (actin dynamics; D1/D2 MSN cellular specificity), structural (morphological), and behavioral
(reinstatement) plasticity induced by heroin. The findings from the work in this application will elucidate
mechanisms by which chronic heroin exposure induces long-term changes in the plasticity of nucleus
accumbens neurons and provides new directions for the development of novel therapies for heroin addiction."
10774239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a lethal blood cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of only 25%. One driver of
especially poor prognosis in AML is mutation of Colony Stimulating Factor 3 Receptor (CSF3R). The normal
function of CSF3R is to promote the expansion of neutrophil precursors and their differentiation into mature
neutrophils. In AML, mutant CSF3R is unable to drive differentiation. We hypothesize that this differentiation
arrest is crucial to the aggressive biology of CSF3R-driven AML.
In AML, differentiation arrest is often driven by genetic alterations in key hematopoietic transcription factors.
Indeed, the vast majority of patients with CSF3R-mutant AML have co-occurring mutations in the transcription
factor CEBPA, or translocations of the core binding factor (CBF) complex. These genetic alterations disrupt
transcription factor function and perturb the epigenetic landscape of myeloid cells. Our data shows that the
combination of mutant CSF3R with either mutant CEBPA or a CBF translocation produces an aggressive, poorly-
differentiated myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, we find that mutant CEBPA alters the balance of signaling
downstream of CSF3R through STAT proteins, to favor proliferative programs at the expense of pro-
differentiation programs. Finally, CBF translocations suppress the expression of CEBPA, suggesting that CEBPA
mutation or dysregulation is a common mechanism of differentiation arrest in CSF3R-driven AML.
We hypothesize that CEBPA mutations and CBF translocations act through altered STAT signaling and
epigenetic dysfunction to disrupt the transcription of differentiation-associated genes. We will test this
hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) understand the functional significance of STAT dysregulation in CSF3R-
mutant AML, and 2) identify a common mechanism of differentiation blockade in CSF3R-mutant AML.
Successful completion of these studies will provide us with a mechanistic understanding of oncogene synergy
in this poor prognosis CSF3R-mutant AML subgroup. This will enable the future development of rational
therapeutic approaches to prevent disease relapse."

 Many persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are unemployed, with estimates indicating rates as high
as 60%. Unemployment results in lower quality of life, greater depression and substance use, and it is
associated with morbidity and mortality. Although PLWHA face substantial challenges in obtaining and
maintaining jobs, interventions based upon behavior analytic and behavioral economics principles can be
applied alongside best practices employment services to enhance behavior change and improve outcomes.
These interventions involve provision of monetary-based reinforcers for objective evidence of behavior change.
They can successfully enhance job-seeking activities, even in highly marginalized and disenfranchised
populations. This study will examine the efficacy of reinforcing job-acquisition activities for improving
employment outcomes in PLWHA who desire to return to the workforce in part- or full-time capacity. In total,
this study will randomly assign 144 unemployed PLWHA to one of two interventions. All participants will
receive usual unemployment services with an emphasis on specific issues related to HIV/AIDS, plus
encouragement for completing activities geared toward employment readiness and acquisition. The enhanced
intervention will involve that same treatment plus chances to win prizes ranging from $1 to $100 for engaging
in job-related activities each week. Participants will receive study treatments for 16 weeks and complete follow-
up evaluations throughout 18 months. Structured evaluations will assess employment outcomes, quality of life
indices, physical and cognitive functioning, psychological symptoms, viral loads, and drug use and risk
behaviors. The hypothesis is that participants reinforced for completing job-related activities will transition to
employment at higher and faster rates and work more often than those who are not reinforced for job-related
activities. We also expect the reinforcement intervention will increase quality of life, reduce depressive
symptoms, and improve medical outcomes. Compared to the standard care condition, it may also maintain or
improve cognitive functioning and medication adherence and reduce risk behaviors that spread infectious
diseases. We will evaluate moderators and mediators of key employment and health outcomes, with an
emphasis on exploring the extent to which work conditions (temporary, under the table, physically or
emotionally demanding jobs etc.) impact psychosocial and physical health. We will conduct cost-effectiveness
analyses to estimate the potential for wide scale dissemination of this intervention if efficacious.

10775719,"Loss of function mutations in SMARCA4/BRG1, a tumor suppressor and core component of
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, occur frequently in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and
harbor a poor prognosis. As a tumor suppressor, aberrations of BRG1 have no actionable therapy.
Modulation of GLI1, a transcription factor and target gene of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
pathway, by alternative pathways has been reported and high expression of GLI1 is correlated
with significantly poor survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients. BRG1-loss has been shown
to up-regulate GLI1 independently of the Hh pathway in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However,
no such studies have been reported in lung cancers. We show that high expression of GLI1 in
LAD cell lines depend upon BRG1-loss. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of GLI1 expression
inhibit the growth and induce cell death in BRG1-deficient lung cancer cell lines. Therefore, we
HYPOTHESIZE that loss of BRG1 upregulates GLI1 expression to drive LAD growth and that
GLI1 is a candidate therapeutic target for BRG1-deficient LAD. The rationale for the proposed
research is that elucidation of the mechanisms by which loss of BRG1 upregulates GLI1
expression will identify novel therapeutic candidates whose modulation will inhibit expression of
the GLI1 transcription factor in BRG1-deficient lung cancers – a cancer type that has no readily
actionable target for treatment. We propose to identify mechanisms for GLI1 suppression by
BRG1 and for upregulation of GLI1 expression with BRG1 loss. We will also test three therapeutic
regimens that inhibit GLI1 expression with drugs that are FDA-approved or in active clinical
testing. We utilize a novel autochthonous mouse model and patient derived xenografts of BRG1-
deficient LAD to test the regimens. We will also identify missense and nonsense mutations that
upregulates GLI1 expression and thus, may serve as predictive biomarkers for the therapies
tested here. If successful, our results will establish a firm scientific rationale for targeting BRG1-
deficient lung cancers with compounds that inhibit GLI1 expression and that are readily available
for clinical testing."
10806238,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), studies have provided significant insights into
unique large-scale functional organizations of the brain including default mode network (DMN) and salience
network (SN). The aberrant communications of brain functional connectivity among these networks have been
observed across different classes of addiction and are associated with craving and relapse. The overarching
goal of this project is to identify the functional role of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in network integration in
normal and addiction conditions. Our central hypotheses are that: 1) distinct functional clusters of neurons exist
in rodent ACC and these clusters coactivate with distinct large-scale brain networks, 2) SN-related neurons in
ACC will be activated in attention tasks whereas DMN-related neurons in ACC will be deactivated. 3) functional
integration of SN-related neurons in ACC is decreased in nicotine addiction and causally relates to attention
deficits via large-scale brain network dysfunctions. While fMRI can be utilized to depict large-scale brain
networks, one technical challenge towards the testing of these hypotheses is to obtain spatially resolved
neuronal activity within the ACC during fMRI. To address this, we will utilize an innovative MRI-compatible
fluorescent miniature microscope, allowing concurrent imaging of ground-truth neuronal activities at cellular
resolution during fMRI. We also implemented a silent zero-echo-time (ZTE) fMRI technique, enabling awake
rodent imaging in a stress-free condition. Addressing these hypotheses will clarify the utility of ACC in predicting
addiction related attention deficits and its putative role in serving as a novel treatment target for addiction.

10784717,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Preterm birth is a major medical problem resulting in disability and death for very preterm infants. Therapeutic approaches
to manage preterm labor are off-label and ineffective. No tocolytic therapy in use today is satisfactory beyond 48 hours, and
none are FDA approved. Preterm labor more often impacts African American women than their Caucasian counterparts.
We seek to understand the dysfunctional relaxation of the myometrium that leads to preterm labor and resulting preterm
birth. Our central hypothesis is that nitric oxide is generated locally within the myometrium by microvascular endothelial
cells as a result of mechanical stretch and increased blood flow to the expanding uterus. Nitric oxide S-nitrosates Cx43 in
the muscle cell. Cx43 S-nitrosation promotes C-terminal phosphorylation that holds Cx43 in its hemichannel state and
favors muscle cell quiescence. Hemichannels form gap junctions at the time of labor. Gap junctions are a feature of activated
myometrium. Promoting connexin 43 S-nitrosation offers a unique target for tocolytic development. Translational
approaches in human pregnancy tissues are essential if we are to discover and exploit the unique mechanisms that subserve
uterine quiescence during pregnancy and their dysregulation in preterm labor."

Despite safety data supporting use of COVID-19 vaccines among pregnant and lactating women, COVID-19
vaccine coverage among perinatal women in the United States is very low, with uptake even lower among
some racial and ethnic groups such as Black/African American and Latina women. Concerningly, pregnancy is
associated with more severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection: pregnant women with COVID-19
have higher rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality compared to women with COVID-19
who are not pregnant. Further, infants born to women with COVID-19 are more likely to be born preterm,
potentially leading to numerous downstream negative consequences for the child’s health and development. In
spite of the high stakes of infection for women and their offspring, little is known about factors contributing to
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) and refusal among perinatal women, particularly those at highest risk for
health disparities. Identifying factors contributing to VH among this vulnerable group of women is crucial to the
development of effective interventions to promote vaccine uptake. Further, little is known about factors relating
to prenatal care provider behavior and recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy
and postpartum. Our experienced, interdisciplinary team proposes a 2-year, mixed methods R21 investigation
that includes both a patient component and a provider component in order to identify key factors contributing to
COVID-19 vaccine uptake and refusal in the perinatal period. In the patient component, we will recruit 120
English and Spanish-speaking financially-disadvantaged pregnant and postpartum women, including half who
were vaccinated in pregnancy and half who are unvaccinated. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and
the Five C’s model of Vaccine Hesitancy, and with input from a diverse group of community stakeholders, we
will assess cognitive and affective factors, psychological symptoms, medical mistrust, and other contributors to
vaccine decision-making. We will conduct qualitative interviews with a subset of women (n=30) to augment our
understanding of factors driving vaccine reluctance and refusal. In the provider component, we will recruit 60
prenatal care providers who work with financially disadvantaged women (OBs, family medicine, midwives,
nurses) to take part in an in-depth survey regarding factors contributing to VH, refusal and uptake during the
perinatal period; a subset of 30 providers will take part in qualitative interviews to explore these issues further.
Our analytic plan involves generalized linear models to examine predictors of patient vaccination outcomes,
and qualitative thematic analysis to identify key themes women and providers endorse regarding COVID-19
vaccine hesitancy. Findings will inform provider education and services innovations, as well as intervention
development to target increased vaccination uptake this vulnerable patient group."

Malaria vaccine RTS,S is a historical milestone to fight malaria. However, we need to continue exploring new
antigens and new approaches to fight against malaria because the protection rate of RTS,S is about 37%. The
difficulty in developing optimal protection of a malaria vaccine indicates the scarcity of suitable malaria vaccine
antigens. Since malaria infection and transmission involve two hosts, malaria transmission through mosquitoes
is obligatory for a Plasmodium parasite to complete its life cycle. The complicated malaria life cycle allows us to
develop a vaccine that targets malaria transmission at the mosquito stage. We identified mosquito
fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) that facilitates Plasmodium transmission to mosquitoes. FREP1 localizes
in the midgut peritrophic matrix; thus, it is easily accessible by antibodies ingested with blood. Sequence
alignment identified a highly conserved C-terminal fibrinogen-related domain (FBG) among anopheline mosquito
orthologs, and this domain can bind parasites. Notably, antibodies against FBG significantly inhibit the
transmission of multiple Plasmodium species (P. berghei, P. falciparum, and P. vivax) to various species of
Anopheles (An. gambiae and An. dirus). Moreover, monoclonal antibodies against some specific epitopes on
FBG is more active in blocking malaria transmission than polyclonal antibodies, indicating that targeting specific
epitopes on FBG will block malaria transmission more effectively. We have also developed a new molecular
adjuvant that stimulates the strong humoral and cellular immune response. We hypothesize that combining
Anopheles-specific epitopes from FBG and our new molecular adjuvant into one vaccine will trigger a robust
immune response to block malaria transmission. We will identify these specific epitopes that can be used to
efficiently block malaria transmission from FBG and fuse the epitopes with our molecular adjuvant to generate
nanoparticles for vaccination. Our long-term goal is to improve the malaria vaccine protection rate, while our
short-term goal is to develop an efficient malaria transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV)."
10885005,"This project will establish a protein engineering platform for evolving monoclonal antibody binding affinity and
specificity to solve the notorious challenge of developing clinical mAbs against tumor associated carbohydrate
antigens (TACAs). Our central hypothesis is that the merger of Qβ carrier protein-elicited mAb discovery and
rationally-guided directed evolution will outpace existing methodologies for discovering powerful antibodies
against challenging TACA glycosylated biomarkers.
TACAs are unique biomarkers to multiple tumor types, yet they have been underutilized for molecular imaging
and diagnostics because of challenges in developing selective, potent binders. Distinct glycosylation patterns
of tumor cell surfaces are hallmark features that arise during oncogenesis through changes in expression
levels of glyco-processing enzymes. Problematically, these aberrant tumorigenic features are usually
undetected by the immune system and rarely identified as non-self. Even when recognized as an antigen,
weak binding against monovalent glycans leads to an insufficient immune response.
To address this need, we will apply our directed evolution methodology to develop lead candidate mAbs
against TACAs selective to cancer with in vivo binding of KD<10nM and specificity >100-fold binding above
control cells. This will be accomplished by first generating a diverse panel of TACA-specific antibodies via
immunization of transgenic mice with multivalent Qβ vaccines. Dominant antibodies will be isolated and
characterized for paratope diversity and the ability to selectively bind the glyco-targets. Next, we use rationally-
guided directed evolution to achieve mAb binding affinity and specificity. Multiple TACA-specific mAbs obtained
through immunization will undergo high-throughput yeast display directed evolution with site-wise
diversification based on structural, stabilizing, and phylogenetic factors to overcome the routinely low affinity of
anti-carbohydrate binders. Specificity and affinity will be evaluated against multiple human tumor cell lines.
This project will: 1) establish a platform that drastically reduces initial discovery time for translatable molecular
imaging and diagnostic tools against carbohydrate antigens; 2) significantly advance understanding of
tumorigenic cell glycosylation patterns; and 3) mark a major step towards improving sensitivity and specificity
of biomarker-based diagnosis of cancers including ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers."

science in the context of a dynamic, multidisciplinary research and team-based mentoring
environment. In this submission, we propose to directly fund 4 Trainees annually. Our program has pooled
the talents of 22 dedicated Faculty Trainers from a wide range of departments—our current program
includes faculty in the departments of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chemistry, Molecular Systems
Biology, Medicine, Microbiology/ Immunology, Epidemiology, Pediatrics, and Engineering—to provide
instruction in CF-related research to PhD and MD/PhD students. The DCFTP will function in the context of a
Research Base already rich in basic, translational, and clinical CF-related studies. The CF research
program at Dartmouth has grown from three investigators and one NIH grant in 1997 to a community of
world-class scientists that currently secure $21.1M per year in direct costs of research funding ($0.96M per
investigator average). Dartmouth will also provide ~$39.6M in institutional support, including direct support
to DartCF, our training program and the affiliated graduate programs, over the next 5 years. Our Training
Faculty use approaches including the study of clinical cohorts, quantitative methods, and
laboratory-based and animal studies; thus, our trainees are exposed to a broad range of scientific
strategies to answer impactful scientific questions. The DCFTP participating Training Faculty, which
include PhD, MD, and MD/PhD researchers, work in a range of disciplines, with CF research as the central
focus; all Training Faculty conduct research, are well funded, and teach and mentor our Trainees. This
group of basic and physician-scientist researchers is actively engaged in CF-related research, with
expertise in cell biology, structural biology, microbiology, immunology, microbiome, genetics, bioinformatics,
statistics, and proteomics. A hallmark of our program is the close and consistent interaction of our Training
Faculty with our DCFTP Trainees via DCFTP-sponsored general and Trainee-specific activities, including
weekly research meetings, courses, journal clubs, and our annual retreat. Training-grant funds and DCFTP-
sponsored, Trainee-specific enhanced activities provide a unifying base that greatly facilitates the strikingly
interactive nature of this group (evidenced by 38 collaborative publications over the past ~5 years among
our 22 Training and 9 Affiliated Faculty) and of the collaborative grants held by these faculty."

Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affects an
estimated six million people worldwide and costs over $23 billion annually in healthcare costs in
the US alone. A major portion of this cost is a direct result of the morbidity related to cognitive
impairment that develops in 50-80% of PD patients. This morbidity appears to be driven by
pathologic accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein and Alzheimer disease (AD)-related
pathologies. The ability to predict the development of cognitive impairment would have impact on
prognosis, treatment, and clinical trial design for preventative therapies in PD. The goal of this
project is to identify novel metabolomic markers associated with cognitive impairment in PD. This
project will utilize gas chromatography mass-spectroscopy (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-
mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) methods to assess the blood- and cerebrospinal fluid-derived
metabolome from advanced PD patients without cognitive impairment. We will then assess
steady-state metabolomic profiles of plasma taken from patients before and after conversion to
cognitive impairment which have been banked over time by the UK-Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center, a portion of which have neuropathological correlation. The results of these
studies will guide a more targeted approach to plasma biomarker evaluation before and after the
conversion from normal to impaired cognition in patients drawn from the clinic population. The
resources of the CNS-Met Metabolomics Core will be essential to the completion of these aims
via assessment of steady-state metabolomics utilizing GC-MS and LC-MS. These studies are
expected to provide new biomarker candidates for predicting conversion to cognitive impairment
in PD and data for future R01-level applications."
10841480,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a major societal and public health concern with over 1.7 million TBIs,
~80% of which mild, are reported each year in the US. TBI is also a major risk factor for dementias and
Alzheimer’s Disease. Mild TBI is characterized by dysfunction of the neurovascular unit (NVU), initiated by
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and followed by synaptic dyshomeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is
apparent in the NVU after mild TBI, accompanied by metabolic imbalance and oxidative damage. This project
will examine the metabolic deficits of distinct components of the NVU, including neuronal synapse and brain
capillaries, by using steady state metabolomics as well as intra-mitochondrial metabolic tracing following mild
TBI. These results will be generated in conjunction with profiling of mitochondrial bioenergetics of the NVU
components. These studies will directly use the resources provided by the CNS-Met Metabolomics Core. P7C3-
A20, which elevates NAD+ and demonstrates efficacy in TBI models, will be administered alongside nicotinamide
mononucleotide, which is a NAD+ precursor, to examine therapeutic effect at restoring alterations in metabolism
and functional outcomes. The completion of these studies will generate an enhanced understanding of
mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolite flux in distinct components of the NVU following mild TBI and provide
supportive data on a pathology-modifying drugs targeting NAD+ to treat this disease."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Over 50 genetic loci have been
associated with late-onset AD risk, yet we still do not fully understand the disease pathogenesis and have
failed to find successful solutions for prevention or treatment of dementia or cognitive decline. AD is influenced
by genetic and environmental (social, built, and physical) factors. Understanding the interplay between these
genetic and non-genetic factors is crucial to address the underlying biology of the disease. Many studies have
focused on identifying either genetic causes or modifiable risk factors associated with AD, and most gene-
environment studies of AD have been restricted to single-gene x single-environmental factor studies (primarily
focusing on the gene APOE). Few studies have addressed how upstream factors like socioeconomic status
and ambient air pollution interact with risk across many genetic locations (polygenic) to influence gene
expression and proteomic changes that lead to AD and related dementias. The specific aims of this study are
to 1. (F99 phase) determine social, built, and physical environmental variables associated with dementia risk
and/or cognitive decline, independent of and modified by polygenic risk and 2. (K00 phase) identify
transcriptomic and proteomic signatures that mediate the effect of environmental exposure on
dementia/cognitive decline. During my dissertation phase, I will train in polygenic risk score computation,
predictive analysis, mixed-effect modeling, and machine learning to characterize the effects of genetic and
environmental determinants on AD and related dementias. I will employ polygenic risk score methods that
have been designed to improve predictive accuracy in multi-ethnic populations. As a post-doctoral fellow, I will
expand my training to multi-omic data integration and analysis to move our understanding of risk factors for AD
and related dementias beyond studies of association to an understanding of causal pathways and the
biological mediators of environmental exposures. This research will leverage the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis parent and ancillary studies (MESA Neighborhood and Aging, MESA MIND, and MESA Air), a
longitudinal cohort unprecedented in its scope of social determinants of health along with dementia
adjudication and multi-omic data. This fellowship application aligns with the NIA Strategic Directions for
Research Goal D-1 “to determine how genetic, molecular, cellular, and social/environmental factors interact for
brain health and neurodegeneration.” As a result of this work, we will have identified upstream (policy-level)
and downstream (biological mechanisms) points of intervention and prevention. In addition, the research and
career development provided by this award will help me launch my career as an independent investigator of
AD prediction and prevention."
10893922,"Project Summary
There are ~800,000 bladder cancer survivors in the US, making it the fifth most prevalent cancer. This study
focuses on the largest group of patients with bladder cancer, the 79% with non-muscle invasive early-stage
cancer. Per current guideline recommendations, these patients undergo transurethral endoscopic resection
followed by surveillance cystoscopy every 3 to 6 months, making cystoscopy common with over a million
procedures per year. Cystoscopy entails direct inspection of the bladder via a cystoscope that is inserted into a
patient's urethra. It can be quite uncomfortable as it is performed in non-sedated patients. In spite of this
burden on patients, high-quality data on the benefits of high-intensity surveillance cystoscopy are lacking. The
experts writing the guidelines recognized the unclear benefit of high-intensity surveillance and specifically
stated: “There is an urgent need for studies to determine if less stringent follow-up regimens can be employed
without significantly affecting oncologic outcomes in these patients.” Replacing cystoscopy with less invasive
urine testing is such a less stringent follow-up regimen. Preliminary data show that the urine tests Xpert
Bladder Cancer Monitor (mRNA-based) and Bladder EpiCheck (DNA methylation test) may replace cystoscopy
procedures, given their high sensitivities. However, with a specificity 0.76 and 0.84, up to one out of four tests
may be false positive, so many patients still have to undergo cystoscopy for positive tests. Thus, longitudinal
comparative data are needed before these tests can be considered for routine care. Specifically, we need
evidence that programmatic surveillance with urine tests significantly decreases the burden of surveillance for
patients and has acceptable oncologic outcomes in diverse populations of bladder cancer survivors. Here, we
will define the extent to which patients' burden of surveillance can be reduced with bladder cancer urine tests.
We propose a three-site randomized phase 2 trial including 240 patients with early-stage bladder cancer. After
a normal surveillance cystoscopy at study entry, patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to programmatic surveillance
with the Xpert bladder cancer urine test, the Bladder EpiCheck urine test, or standard cystoscopy. We will
(1) determine whether burden of surveillance is significantly decreased in the urine testing arms versus
standard cystoscopy, (2) compare short-term safety outcomes in the urine testing arms versus standard
cystoscopy at 1 and 2 years, and (3) estimate important feasibility data for a subsequent large non-inferiority
comparative effectiveness trial. In summary, we will systematically study whether the burden of surveillance
cystoscopy can be improved among bladder cancer survivors by replacing invasive cystoscopy with urine
testing, ultimately improving their quality of life. If bladder cancer urine tests significantly decrease the burden
of surveillance, our data will provide a strong justification for a subsequent comparative effectiveness trial of
programmatic surveillance with urine testing versus standard cystoscopy that is large enough to be powered
for oncologic outcomes."
10809743,"SUMMARY
Many biological processes occur not at the level of a cell but at the level of a system, and cell-cell interactions
are crucial for tissue function. With the introduction of single-cell RNA-Seq, we have robust measures of cell
types and cell states. In this approach however, the tissue under study must be dissociated prior to sequencing
resulting in the loss of spatial context. Spatial transcriptomics is a promising new field, in which several
methods have been developed to profile the transcriptome of cells in their native context. However, the most
widely used implementation of this technology – sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics – has not reached
single-cell resolution. Thus, there is a critical need for novel computational approaches integrating spatial
transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-Seq in order to infer cell-cell relationships in complex tissues. Our lab has
recently developed analyses for multimodal intersection of these two data sources that effectively mitigate the
limitations of each technology. Here, we propose to apply this concept to uncover patterns of cell-cell
interactions in biological systems. In our first Aim, we present the StateMap approach to infer local cell-cell
interactions by spatial transcriptomics-based co-localization and receptor-ligand relationships. A catalog of cell
types and cell states is first delineated using single-cell data, and the spatial transcriptomics data is then
harnessed to map pairs of co-localizing cell states. StateMap then systematically infers the cell-cell interaction
mechanisms among co-localizing cell states by statistically testing for signal/response relationships in the
spatial transcriptomics data. In our second Aim, we propose the ST-motif method to conceptualize the
locations of cell types and states as a network, allowing for systematic analysis by a wealth of available
methods. Our approach thus reframes the problem of finding cell-cell relationships as a network motif problem
in this graph. Throughout our proposal, we develop and test the algorithms on two model systems, the male
germline and the placenta, with which our lab has considerable experience. Conceptually, our proposal
promises to yield novel algorithms for mapping cell-cell interactions that are required for actuating the potential
of two powerful transcriptomic technologies."

The link between obesity and cancer is well-established epidemiologically, but poorly understood at a
mechanistic level. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of renal cancer, and has
clear ties with metabolic syndrome. ccRCC simultaneously demonstrates drastic metabolic rewiring at the
histological and molecular levels that recently have been found to be essential for tumor development.
Currently, however, the standard of care for ccRCC is targeted therapeutics against tyrosine kinases including
the VEGF receptor, that in most cases lead to modest improvements in overall survival. Thus identification of
new approaches to treat ccRCC is needed, and altered metabolism may offer a clinically useful foothold. We
have investigated the characteristic lipid storage phenotype of ccRCC and identified a molecular mechanism
that is driven in part by obesity. The present application focusses on a soluble adipokine produced by fat and
tumors that suppresses lipid catabolism, and is essential for tumor growth. The very nature of a secreted
factor leads to both diagnostic and therapeutic potential, and here we investigate the impact of inhibiting the
adipokine, Chemerin, with multiple approaches including a monoclonal antibody in preclinical animal models of
ccRCC, and a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). We will also dissect the mechanisms of action of
Chemerin on tumor and non-tumor cells, and examine the significance of Chemerin isoforms in collected
clinical specimens. Together, the aim of the proposal is to validate a novel target in ccRCC that could be
combined with existing therapies to improve patient outcomes."

The recent CANTOS trial showed that administration of an antibody targeting IL-1b reduced coronary events,
supporting the concept of anti-inflammatory therapy as a way to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD). However,
due to a modest effect and an excess of infections this treatment has not been approved for CVD treatment.
This suggests the need for new approaches and for targeting anti-inflammatory therapy to patients who need it
most. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a highly prevalent condition in the elderly, arises from somatic mutations that
endow a proliferative advantage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). CH increases the risk of myocardial
infarction and stroke independently of traditional risk factors and in mouse models increases macrophage (Mf)
inflammation and atherosclerosis. This application will seek to elucidate mechanisms linking clonal
hematopoiesis to accelerated atherosclerosis, focusing on one particular cause of CH involving a gain of function
in the signaling molecule JAK2. Relative to other common genetic variants giving rise to CH, this particular
variant JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) increases Jak/Stat signaling, occurs at a younger age and imparts a greater risk of
premature coronary heart disease. Our recent studies have shown a key role of Mf inflammasome activation, IL-
1b secretion and Mf proliferation in promoting atherosclerosis in mice expressing Jak2VF. Il-1b antibody treatment
reduced features of atherosclerotic plaque instability in a mouse model of Jak2VF CH. In human studies we
showed that the myocardial infarction associated with JAK2VF is increased by a common loss of function genetic
variant in LNK that normally acts to suppress JAK/STAT signaling. This proposal will use mouse models that
authentically replicate the human genetic variants to elucidate the mechanisms and consequences of Jak2VF-
mediated inflammasome activation in atherosclerosis and the potential modulation of these effects by Lnk. The
overall hypothesis is that metabolic changes in Jak2VF Mfs lead to Aim2 inflammasome activation, Gasdermin D
cleavage, IL-1 secretion, pryoptotic cell death and necrotic core formation in atherosclerotic lesions. Our studies
may suggest that suggest that precise application of anti-IL-1β or anti-inflammasome therapy based on CH status
and LNK genotype could substantially reduce cardiovascular risk."

10807042,"This project continues long term studies into mechanisms of morphgenesis. Here the focus is on an
investigation into an Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The goal is to understand how this complex
morphogenetic movement works at a molecular level. The EMT is an essential morphogenetic movement used
by almost all animals. Its failure contributes to a number of birth defects, and it is also co-opted, at least in
part, by metastatic processes of carcinomas leading to the spread of tumors.
The model system used here is the sea urchin skeletogenic cells which undergo an EMT synchronously at 9 hr
after fertilization. Knowledge of the cells, the known timing of the EMT, and many experimental tools for this
system provide an excellent model for discovery of how the process works. A number of assays and
approaches enable the EMT process to be studied in detail at a molecular level as it occurs in this system. Prior
research identified essential transcription factors that regulate the component processes of the EMT. Distinct
transcription factors regulate activation of motility, basement membrane remodeling, cell polarity change, and
de-adhesion. To build on this foundation, the proposal is for studies to identify molecular effectors
downstream of those transcription factors. The effectors already obtained, and those sought, control the on-
time delivery of signals to activate the motility, conduct the basement membrane remodeling, regulate the
de-adhesion, coordinate the several component processes, and convert the epithelial membrane into a
functioning mesenchymal membrane. The project is enabled by a number of advances in the past funding
cycle. RNA-seq and scRNA-seq databases recording temporal transects through the EMT interval were
obtained. A pipeline was established to identify candidate molecules, authenticate their participation, and
identify the role they play in the EMT process. Additional candidates will be obtained using these systems
level databases. New molecular tools were advanced so that multiple approaches are available for testing and
authenticating candidate participation and function. In addition, two other tissues that undergo later
synchronous EMTs have been added to the project. Pigment cells and blastocoelar cells each undergo EMT 3
hrs and 7 hrs after the skeletogenic cells. These additions enable us to determine which effectors are used for
one, two, or all three of the EMTs. Although preliminary evidence indicates that even though the three cell
types are derived from mesodermal precursors in the embryo, their EMTs are conducted by largely
independent molecular components. Nevertheless, there is some overlap so it is important to learn which
components are unique to a particular EMT and which may be more universal. Before translational advances
can be applied it is necessary to understand the EMT sequence in detail and to know which molecular
pathways are universal. This project therefore is of great value in gaining a detailed understanding of how the
EMT works."

 Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that causes disease and death in the
immunocompromised and is a leading cause of congenital disabilities. HCMV replication requires lipids.
Since HCMV does not encode a metabolic network, virus replication depends on host lipid metabolism.
However, little is known about how HCMV reprograms host metabolism to ensure lipids required for virus
replication are made. Our overall goal is to understand the virus-host interactions that regulate lipid synthesis
essential for HCMV replication. Recently, we showed that HCMV infection results in an increase in lipid
synthesis and a rise in lipid abundances. Here we demonstrate that HCMV infection induces the synthesis of
at least 20 previously undescribed lipids unique to infected cells. Most of these unique lipids are phospholipids
with very long-chain fatty acid tails (PL-VLCFAs). The PL-VLCFAs discussed in this application are
understudied in general and unstudied in HCMV biology beyond our work. While shorter FA tails have been
well-studied, we know little about lipids with VLCFAs tails that are as long as those we observe in HCMV
infection, including how they will behave in a biological membrane. The molecular mechanisms underlying this
HCMV-induced expansion in the host lipidome and the functional roles of the newly generated lipids are
largely unknown.
 We discovered that HCMV pUL37x1 and pUL38 proteins promote PL-VLCFA synthesis, laying the
foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which HCMV reprograms lipid synthesis. pUL37x1 and
pUL38 induce Ca2+ and mTOR signaling, respectively. We have preliminary data suggesting that stress
responses related to these signaling pathways contribute to HCMV remodeling of lipids. We hypothesize that
pUL37x1 and pUL38 use Ca2+ and mTOR signaling to promote the synthesis of PC-VLCFAs required for
HCMV replication. We will test this hypothesis by determining the mechanisms by which pUL37x1 and pUL38
promote synthesis of PL-VLCFAs (Aim 1) and defining the PL-VLCFA synthesis enzymes required for HCMV
replication and the role of PL-VLCFAs in infection (Aim 2). These studies will determine the mechanisms by
which HCMV interacts with the host to create a unique lipid environment advancing our knowledge of HCMV
reprogramming of metabolism. Furthermore, these studies will define the biological functions of PC-VLCFAs
in HCMV replication and further our understanding of lipids required for HCMV infection. Determining the
mechanisms involved in HCMV-induced reprogramming of lipid metabolism and functions of PC-VLCFAs will
advance knowledge in HCMV biology needed to identify new targets for treating infection."

RNA is a structurally adaptive polymer that adopts complex tertiary structures and undergoes dramatic large-
scale conformational changes to regulate cellular activity. Integral to RNA function is its remarkable plasticity
and ability to structurally adapt in response to stimuli including small molecules and protein cofactors. Despite a
central role in biology, a comprehensive understanding of the principles that govern RNA folding and molecular
recognition is lacking. This research program addresses these gaps to understand, at an atomic level, how RNA
folds and recognizes binding partners during normal cell function and in disease states. Using RNA aptamers
and the 7SK ribonucleoprotein (RNP) as model systems, we combine solution NMR spectroscopy, X-ray
crystallography, mass spectrometry, and basic biochemistry in a multidisciplinary approach to advance
understanding of RNA structural dynamics and molecular assembly. The eukaryotic 7SK RNP is a major
regulator of transcription. Comprised of the 7SK RNA and protein components, 7SK RNP binds and inactivates
the kinase activity of the essential positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). P-TEFb must be released
from the 7SK RNP to activate RNA Polymerase II transcription processive elongation. P-TEFb dysregulation or
7SK RNP malfunction is associated with several genetic diseases including cancers, heart disease, and
primordial dwarfism. Moreover, several viruses manipulate host 7SK RNP for viral survival, notably HIV-1 and
more recently SARS-CoV-2 underscoring the significance of 7SK RNP in biological processes. Despite its critical
function and biomedical significance, there are presently few mechanistic insights into 7SK RNP function in stark
contrast to other regulatory RNPs. This gap is largely due to a lack of fundamental knowledge on basic 7SK RNP
features: how 7SK RNA folds, how proteins assemble onto 7SK RNA, and how 7SK RNP is structured. There is
a critical need to answer these outstanding questions to provide foundational insights into 7SK RNP structural
biology, and are essential to achieving a comprehensive understanding of 7SK RNP and its central role in
biology. Over the next five years, we will determine high resolution structures of RNA aptamer-ligand complexes,
7SK RNA elements involved in P-TEFb release, and 7SK RNA-protein complexes. We will identify the
determinants for RNA-ligand or RNA-protein binding specificity, elucidate 7SK RNA conformational dynamics,
and uncover the 7SK RNP proteome and protein-protein interaction network during normal cell function and
under genotoxic stress. Long-term, we will use newly gained knowledge to rationally design improved aptamer-
ligand pairs, determine global folding and dynamics of 7SK RNA, identify the molecular mechanisms of P-TEFb
release from 7SK RNP, and determine the 7SK RNP macromolecular architecture. Findings will address critical
knowledge gaps in RNA molecular recognition, 7SK RNA structure, 7SK RNA-protein recognition, and RNP
organization. This work will provide fundamental knowledge of RNA-protein interactions that can be extended to
understanding the foundational principles of RNA-protein recognition for other RNPs."
10880606,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Our lab focuses on structural and functional studies of molecular machines involved in chemical
modifications of macromolecules. Naturally occurring chemical modifications of macromolecules play essential
roles in all aspects of molecular biology, from transcriptional and translational regulation to functional modulation
of various proteins. Misregulation of the chemical modifications is involved in many human diseases such as
cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Although many have been described and characterized, there are still
significant amounts of chemical modification systems that are poorly understood. Our long term goal is to
elucidate the structure and function of molecular machines involved in various chemical modification systems
and develop new tools and strategies to modulate their activity against the relevant diseases based on what we
have learned. In the next five years, we will be focusing on two systems, the p97 related ubiquitination system
and the Vault related ADP-ribosylation system.
 More than thirty mutations of human p97 have been identified, which are associated with a number of
neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanism, however, remains elusive. Through structural biology
approaches and protein engineering, we will address 1) how p97 processes ubiquitin chains of different
topologies through the cofactors; 2) the structural and functional consequences of disease mutations; 3) the
mechanism of inhibitors of p97 and its cofactors. Our efforts promise unprecedented insights into the function of
p97, a central hub of cellular protein homeostasis.
 Vault is the largest ribonucleoprotein in eukaryotic cells with a unique structure. The function of Vault has
been linked to drug resistance in cancer and innate immune response. Recently, major vault protein (MVP) was
identified as one of the 9 marker genes that can predict influenza vaccination responses. Given the importance
of vaccine development during this COVID-19 pandemic, a deep understanding of Vault’s molecular mechanism
is critical. We are going to focus on PARP4, the only enzyme in the Vault complex catalyzing ADP-ribosylation.
Elucidating the function of PARP4 and how it interacts with Vault particle is the key to understand the molecular
function of Vault."

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most severe manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease
(cGVHD) in survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), leading to irreversible pulmonary
impairment, poor quality of life, and 5-year survival of 40%. Fundamental gaps in knowledge of the pathogenic
events that contribute to progressive lung dysfunction in BOS have not been well characterized, hampering our
ability to intervene effectively. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory viruses, including respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and influenza (FLU), are
independent risk factors for the development of BOS. Additionally, we show that asymptomatic respiratory viral
infections (RVI) are common posttransplant. We have shown that mobile wireless home spirometry is feasible
in patients with cGVHD and can enable early diagnosis and a granular understanding of the trajectory of lung
function decline. Our overarching hypothesis is that cumulative respiratory viral exposure leads to the
development of BOS and poor outcomes in the context of alloimmunity. The overall aim of this proposal is
to establish the temporal relationship between RVI along the continuum of disease presentations, from
asymptomatic to symptomatic upper respiratory tract to lower tract disease, and the lung function trajectory of
BOS. We propose to conduct a multicenter prospective longitudinal study of the natural history of RVI and lung
function with an innovative home monitoring approach that overcomes the barriers to understanding clinical
events that lead to BOS and severe BOS phenotypes. Aim 1 investigates the role of RVI as triggers BOS. We
will enroll alloHCT recipients at risk for BOS (Cohort 1, n=200), including those with a diagnosis of cGVHD or a
history of high-risk RVI (RSV/PIV/HMPV/Flu/SARS-CoV2). Patient will perform weekly home spirometry and
protocolized surveillance and symptom-prompted self-collected nasal swab viral PCR. In addition, serum will be
collected quarterly via a needle-less home blood collection kit and assayed with VirScan, a novel comprehensive
serosurvey that detects epitopes of >1000 virus strains, in order to assess the impact of cumulative respiratory
viral burden on BOS outcomes. Aim 2 examines the role of RVI on pulmonary exacerbations in BOS, as well as
the association of cumulative RVI exposure (as determined by VirScan) on accelerated FEV1 decline in patients
with a severe BOS phenotype. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of BOS (Cohort 2, n=80), will perform the same
procedures as Cohort 1. For both aims, viral PCR and VirsScan results will be compared and analyzed as
predictors for BOS development or accelerated FEV1 decline. The critical data generated by this study will
improve recognition of early BOS in the context of RVI, risk stratify patients at highest risk for intensive
monitoring, and identify tangible endpoints and biologic rationale for testing early interventions and novel
therapies. Importantly, this proposal will also establish a unique adult and pediatric multicenter Consortium with
the specific goal of addressing lung disease in HCT recipients, an area of significant and urgent unmet need."
10873856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Functional circuits between the approximately 80 billion human neurons connecting trillions of synapses in
the human brain must be established during development. Failure to organize proper neural circuits has been
linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and neuropsychiatric diseases. During development,
individual neurons extend highly branched neurites that innervate the surrounding territory with minimal
overlap. Moreover, some neuronal subtypes, such as serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, must tile
throughout receptive fields in the brain to ensure that their neurites do not cross over or clump with sister or
neighboring neurites or other neurons of the same type. Proper wiring of these neuronal cell types is required
for the physiological distribution of serotonin and dopamine in the brain.
 In mammals, a family of highly diverse cell-surface homophilic proteins, the clustered protocadherins
(cPcdh), provides each neuron a unique cell-specific identity required for normal neural circuit assembly. The
protocadherin gene cluster encompasses three distinct gene clusters, designated ,  and and previous
studies from our laboratory demonstrated that a single gene in the Pcdh gene cluster (Pcdhc2) is required
for normal serotonergic wiring in mice. Deletion of the entire Pcdh gene cluster or Pcdhc2 alone led to
clumping and crossing of serotonergic neurons (a tiling defect), and altered behavior (depression and
enhanced fear response).
 These findings provided significant advances in defining a role for individual cPCDH proteins in specific
neuronal subtypes; however, a role for the exclusive expression of specific cPcdh isoforms in other neuronal
subtypes and the mechanisms used to execute self-avoidance and tiling remain poorly understood. Here, we
propose to address these gaps in understanding by studying the role of the cPcdh gene cluster in the wiring of
dopaminergic neurons and behavior in mice. In Aim 1, we will survey the transcriptional landscape of cPcdh
isoforms across midbrain dopaminergic neurons in mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of Pcdhβ cluster
on dopaminergic wiring, dopamine release and reward prediction and novelty behaviors. In Aim 3, we will
examine the mechanism by which PCDHβ proteins, establish proper DAN organization. Together, these new
directions should provide novel insights into the molecular logic underlying neural circuit formation and have
implications for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders."

Approximately three-quarters of the 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the U.S. experience clinically significant
sexual distress and dysfunction. This cancer-related sexual morbidity can be addressed by Internet interventions
that include multiple therapeutic techniques to target the overlapping biopsychosocial aspects of the problem;
however, the full potential impact of these interventions has yet to be realized due to high refusal rates from time
burden and high attrition rates. A more efficient sexual morbidity intervention that retains efficacy while lowering
participant burden would have greater public health impact. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to determine
an Internet intervention that is optimized for greatest impact on breast cancer-related sexual morbidity, to
evaluate mediators and moderators of intervention component efficacy, and examine survivors’ engagement
with the intervention components. Specifically, we will test four research-tested and fully-automated Internet
intervention components for breast cancer survivors – psychoeducation about cancer-related sexual morbidity,
training for communication with their clinicians, training for communication with their partners, and physical
intimacy enhancement – using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) research framework. We will recruit
320 intimately partnered women who have completed primary breast cancer treatment and report sexual
morbidity through the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). In the highly-efficient optimization
trial, participants will be randomized to receive a combination of the four intervention components and will
complete online assessments at baseline (pre-randomization), 3-month post-assessment, and 6-month post-
assessment. For Aim 1, we determine the optimal breast cancer-related sexual morbidity intervention package
by following a systematic data-driven approach that tests intervention component effects both independently and
synergistically on sexual distress (primary outcome) and sexual functioning (secondary outcome). For Aim 2, we
will evaluate mediators (sexual functioning knowledge; sexual communication self-efficacy with providers and
with partners; relationship intimacy) and moderators (menopausal status at diagnosis; adjuvant endocrine
therapy use; metastatic disease; psychological distress; relationship duration and dissatisfaction) of intervention
component efficacy on sexual morbidity. Last, for Aim 3, we will examine survivors’ engagement and satisfaction
with the intervention components. As the first MOST study of cancer-related sexual morbidity, this study is
directly responsive to NOSI NOT-OD-20-106 and to calls from leaders in cancer control to advance intervention
science through systematically testing intervention components and their mechanisms. By identifying the
combination of sexual morbidity intervention components likely to provide breast cancer survivors the greatest
benefit for the least burden, this study will result in the first Internet intervention optimized for maximum impact
for the undertreated, prevalent, and devastating problem of breast cancer-related sexual morbidity."

 Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and
brain cancer. Advances in protein/gene profiling techniques and high throughput drug screening technologies
have spawned many new drug candidates. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has impeded the
development and clinical realization of this new generation of neurotherapeutics by restricting the brain uptake
of most small molecule therapeutics, and prohibiting brain uptake of protein- and gene-based medicines. A
promising noninvasive brain delivery strategy takes advantage of endogenous BBB transport mechanisms as a
means to shuttle drug cargo from the blood to the brain. Such receptor-mediated transport systems can be
targeted using the exquisite specificity of antibodies that are in turn linked to a drug payload that can include
small molecules, proteins, or DNA therapeutics. After binding to the receptor on the blood side, the antibody-
drug conjugate acts as an artificial substrate for the transporter and is transcytosed from the blood, across the
BBB, and into the brain. However, current approaches have yielded limited brain uptake because the targeted
transporters are ubiquitously expressed and the antibody targeting reagents have low BBB permeability.
 Therefore, this proposal is focused on the identification and validation of a new panel of antibodies and
cognate transporters that can mediate BBB crossing of therapeutics. The antibodies were identified by mining
a large phage display antibody library against a BBB model comprising human induced pluripotent stem cell-
derived brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (BMECs). The barrier characteristics of these BMECs are well-
suited to screen large antibody libraries for those antibodies capable of crossing the BBB in vitro. Moreover, at
the transcriptome level, the transporter profiles in these cells correlate quite well to freshly isolated human
BMECs. Finally, the human sourcing ensures that identified antibodies recognize human BBB transporters.
Using this innovative platform, we have identified a panel of high value antibodies that preliminary data indicate
are capable of binding both the human and murine BBB and delivering pharmacologically relevant amounts of
drug cargo to the murine brain. We propose to further validate these brain targeting antibodies by identifying
their cognate transporters. Next, we will determine their pharmacokinetic properties, biodistribution and brain
regiospecificity. Finally, the antibodies will be tested for their ability to mediate brain uptake of conjugated drug
cargo to normal brain and to diseased brain in the form of a murine stroke model. Those antibodies that exhibit
significant and selective brain uptake would represent new, noninvasive drug delivery vectors with potential
application in many neurological disease settings."

 Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue
fever, and Zika virus. Vector control using insecticides is currently the primary means of preventing the
transmission of these diseases. In light of the rapid spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations, it
is imperative to add new insecticides with different modes of action to the arsenal of mosquito control agents.
The juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathway is an attractive target for the control of mosquito vectors. JH is a
key regulator of mosquito development and reproduction. Exposure of adult mosquitoes to pyriproxyfen, a
synthetic JH mimic, has shown promise to effectively sterilize female mosquitoes. Our goal of this project is to
elucidate the molecular pathways utilized by JH and its mimics to modulate mosquito fecundity.
 Mosquito egg development is mainly governed by JH and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). In the last funding
cycle, we demonstrated that the Methoprene-tolerant (MET) protein is an intracellular receptor of JH. Both
natural JH and pyriproxyfen binds to Aedes aegypti MET with high affinity. Upon binding of JH, MET forms a
dimer with Taiman, a transcriptional factor that is involved in both JH and 20E responses. The MET-Taiman
complex directly regulates the expression of JH-controlled genes. Besides the genomic action, we also
reported a rapid JH signaling that is initiated from the plasma membrane. The non-genomic action, which relies
on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), modulates the DNA-binding of the MET-Taiman complex and regulates the
alternative splicing of the taiman gene. While the membrane-initiated JH signaling plays critically important
roles in mosquito reproduction, the membrane JH receptor and the specific RTK have not yet been identified in
mosquitoes. Our recent study demonstrates that a small portion of MET is associated with the plasma
membrane in mosquito cells. Furthermore, depletion of MET eradicates the JH-activated increase in
intracellular Ca2+, which is part of extranuclear JH signaling. Thus, our results suggest that the membrane-
associated MET acts as a membrane JH receptor to mediate the non-genomic action of JH.
 In this proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that the JH action in mosquitoes is mediated by both
membrane-bound and nuclear MET proteins, and that pyriproxyfen uses this JH signaling pathway to inhibit
20E-regulated gene expression. In Aim 1, we will define the roles of membrane MET in the membrane binding
of JH and the membrane-initiated JH signaling. In Aim 2, we will investigate how membrane MET mediates the
nongenomic action of JH in mosquitoes. In Aim 3, we will elucidate how pyriproxyfen utilizes the JH signaling
pathway to suppress the vitellogenic 20E response. This study will add a new dimension to our understanding
of the JH signaling pathway that is required for mosquito reproduction. It may also reveal new targets in the JH
signaling pathway that can be exploited for pesticide development."

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that presents as
early as preschool. Inattention and hyperactivity in childhood interfere with the development of social and
preacademic skills leading to lifelong impairment. Current treatments for children with ADHD have failed to
make substantial changes in the trajectory of symptoms and impairment for individuals with ADHD. Sleep is a
modifiable factor that is linked to ADHD symptom persistence and exacerbation. The most common sleep
problems amongst preschool children (3-5 years old) are behavioral, including bedtime resistance and
nighttime awakenings, and amenable to parent behavioral interventions (PBIs). The American Academy of
Pediatrics recommends PBIs as the first line treatment for children with ADHD to address disruptive behaviors
due to ADHD. However, sleep has not been included within PBIs to address ADHD symptoms in young
children. In addition, interventions for childhood ADHD are typically challenging for families to access, as they
are often delivered in specialty mental health clinics. Thus, in this innovative project we will adapt the COPEing
with ADHD PBI program, that has been shown to address ADHD-associated disruptive behaviors, to target
sleep disrupting behaviors for preschool aged children at elevated risk for ADHD, which will be delivered by
behavioral health (BH) therapists embedded in pediatric primary care. In response to the R34 Program
Announcement MH-21-230, Pilot Effectiveness Trials of Interventions for Preschoolers with ADHD, we will hold
focus groups (Aim 1) with pediatricians (n=10), behavioral health therapists embedded in pediatric primary
care (n=10), and caregivers of 3-5 year old children (n=10) to inform the integration and delivery of a brief,
sleep-focused PBI (SF-PBI) in pediatric primary care. We will then conduct a pilot effectiveness trial (Aims 2
and 3) with a randomized, waitlist-control design for 50 families of children 3-5 year old children with early
ADHD symptoms and sleep problems. This trial will (a) test the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of
the of the SF-PBI delivered in pediatric primary care; (b) examine change in target engagement (sleep) and
ADHD symptoms; and (c) assess the relation between sleep and ADHD symptoms changes. Outcomes from
this pilot effectiveness trial will inform a large-scale clinical trial to target sleep amongst preschool-aged
children at elevated risk for ADHD via accessible, primary care-based intervention that harnesses parenting
strategies. This work could ultimately improve outcomes for children at risk for ADHD by intervening early on
sleep to reduce the prevalence, symptoms, and associated impairments of ADHD amongst children and
families."

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adolescence is associated with significant psychosocial impairment,
health problems, school failure, and suicidality. Many youth remain substantially symptomatic despite receiving
current first-line treatments, underscoring the need for novel, modifiable targets to improve depression
treatment outcomes. Between 60-81% of adolescents suffering from MDD have evening circadian preference
(ECP), defined as the behavioral predilection for later sleep and wake timing. ECP is associated with increased
MDD severity, poor antidepressant response, recurrent MDD episodes, and increased suicidality. In an initial
efficacy study among 42 youth with MDD and ECP, an evidence based cognitive-behavioral sleep therapy, the
Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C), resulted in improved depression trajectories for
one year compared to an active control. The therapeutic effect of TranS-C on MDD was mediated by
increasing the time from when subjects have onset of melatonin release in dim light in the evening (dim light
melatonin onset [DLMO], the gold standard objective measurement of biological circadian rhythm timing) and
average wake time. This measure of the alignment between the timing of circadian biology and behavior is
commonly employed in circadian rhythm research and referred to as the phase angle difference (PAD)
between DLMO and waketime (PADDLMO WAKETIME). Initial efficacy study data suggests that 90% of youth with
ECP and MDD have a short PADDLMO WAKETIME that will be lengthened by TranS-C. Building on our initial efficacy
study, we propose a sufficiently powered confirmatory efficacy trial to confirm that TranS-C will lengthen
PADDLMO WAKETIME and thereby improve depression in adolescents with ECP, MDD and short PADDLMO WAKETIME.
Following the Experimental Therapeutics Approach, we propose a blinded randomized controlled trial of
TranS-C in 200 adolescents with MDD, ECP, and short PADDLMO WAKETIME to confirm target engagement
(lengthening PADDLMO WAKETIME) and whether engaging this target has a therapeutic effect on MDD. Adolescents
will receive 8 weeks of TranS-C or a credible comparator condition (Psychoeducation). If successful this study
will provide a low stigma, safe, data driven precision medicine approach, for improving MDD for adolescents
with MDD, ECP and short PADDLMO WAKETIME, a large, underserved, and vulnerable sub-group. It will also
establish short PADDLMO WAKETIME as a new target for the development of other novel antidepressant therapies."
10799572,"Alveolarization, the final stage of lung development occurring primarily postnatally, markedly increases
gas exchange surface area. Rapid growth of the pulmonary vasculature by angiogenesis during early
alveolarization drives distal lung growth, and disrupted angiogenesis impairs alveolarization. In other organs,
specialized macrophages support angiogenesis by promoting blood vessel formation, providing survival and
migratory cues to EC, and facilitating vascular anastomoses. However, the role of macrophages in the
developing pulmonary vasculature remains entirely unknown. We recently embarked on a project employing
single cell RNA-sequencing to define macrophage diversity during late embryonic and early postnatal lung
development. Macrophages are extremely heterogenous with diverse phenotypes that are lineage- and tissue-
specific, and highly influenced by the microenvironment. Preliminary data in this proposal demonstrate a
tremendous increase in macrophage diversity after birth. Specialized, highly proliferative macrophages present
before birth are replaced after birth by a complex and dynamic mixture of diverse macrophage subtypes
exhibiting unique gene signatures, developmental gradients in gene expression, and specific locations within the
lung suggesting distinct functions in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity. Interestingly, a subset of
embryonic macrophages was found to completely encircle small arterioles and express numerous genes that
regulate lung branching, angiogenesis, and EC phenotype. After birth, these cells transitioned to an intermediate
subset present only during the first few weeks of postnatal life that expressed additional tissue remodeling genes.
Taken together, our data suggest the hypothesis that distinct macrophage populations support alveolarization
by regulating pulmonary vascular development through the expression of factors that influence vascular growth
and remodeling, which will be tested through three specific aims. Aim 1 will combine multiplexed in situ
hybridization, lineage tracing, studies in primary EC and macrophages, and advanced imaging in transgenic and
knock-out mice to define the role of specific macrophage subsets in modulating EC phenotype and regulating lung
parenchymal and vascular growth. Aim 2 will utilize multiplexed in situ hybridization, conditional knock out mouse
models, and ligand-receptor profiling of single cell datasets from pulmonary EC and macrophages to probe pathways
mediating macrophage-EC communication. Finally, Aim 3 will determine if chronic hyperoxia alters diversity and
phenotype of the lung macrophages during acute injury and after recovery, and specifically impairs
developmental and homeostatic functions of lung macrophages. The successful completion of these studies will
provide a multifaceted view of the diverse functions of lung macrophages during embryonic and early postnatal
development at single cell resolution, and identify new pathways that could be directly translated into novel
strategies to modulate vascular growth and regeneration in diseases marked by impaired pulmonary
angiogenesis."
10795888,"ABSTRACT
Age-related neurodegenerative diseases pose an immense biomedical challenge. Plastic changes in the brain
underpin aging-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration but little is known about the neuroprotective
pathways that forestall these processes in healthy aging brains. In mammals, glia composition and
properties display age-related dynamics including a shift to a more neuroprotective function as the brain
ages. In Drosophila, glia are also implicated in regulating brain health and lifespan, underscoring a deep
evolutionary conservation of glia function.
The goal of this proposal is to determine how glia contribute to healthy brain aging and longevity using
Harpegnathos saltator ants, a powerful model system to study the molecular and epigenetic regulation of
aging. Adult Harpegnathos workers can become queens (called “gamergates”) via a phenotypic transition
that results in a 5-fold extension of lifespan.
We performed single-cell RNA-seq before and after the transition of workers to long-lived gamergates and
found remarkable plasticity in the glia. Specifically, we found that ensheathing glia cells were substantially
expanded in gamergate brains. Interestingly, gamergates retained high levels of ensheathing glia as they
aged, whereas worker brains were rapidly depleted of these cells over the course of their life.
Ensheathing glia cells respond to damage and provide general housekeeping and neuroprotective functions in
Drosophila but they are not known to contribute to healthy brain aging and longevity. Our data suggest the
hypothesis that an expanded ensheathing glia compartment contributes to the prolonged lifespan of
gamergates.
In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular and cellular changes that accompany the ensheathing glia
dynamics during differential aging in worker and gamergates. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of a specific
receptor that is expressed in ensheathing glia cells and might directly regulate their expansion in response to
the expression of a reproductive gene in gamergates. In Aim 3, we will utilize primary ant neuronal cultures and
genetic manipulations in Drosophila to determine the causal link between ensheathing glia and longevity and
its mechanism.
Together, our work will elucidate 1) new molecular pathways that control glia plasticity, 2) a new biological role
for glia plasticity, and 3) mechanisms for the regulation of healthy brain aging by glia."
10816615,"Childhood obesity remains one of the most serious public health challenges because of its persistent high
prevalence and adverse health consequences. There is an urgent need for novel biomarkers which can predict
and provide effective interventional targets for the early prevention of childhood obesity. Although a growing
body of evidence strongly supports maternal conditions during pregnancy which reflect fetal intrauterine
exposures are associated with obesity risk in offspring, it is still far from fully understanding prenatal programming
for offspring obesity. The emerging metabolomics technology, a systematic profiling of low-molecular-weight
metabolites in biofluids and tissues, provides a snapshot of ongoing physiological processes as well as external
environmental exposures. Thus, prenatal metabolomics profiling will have the potential to represent biological
processes of both endogenous and exogenous factors, providing biological mechanisms underlying prenatal
programming of offspring health and early biomarkers for predicting child disease development. However,
studies of prenatal metabolomic profiling for child obesity, especially longitudinal profiling which integrates
measurements from multiple time points during pregnancy, are still scarce. The overall goal of the proposed
study is to identify prenatal circulating metabolomic profiles which are associated with early childhood growth
trajectories and overweight/obesity risk in offspring and to examine their associations with metabolomic profiles
of cord blood (for mechanism investigation) and prenatal modifiable risk factors (for intervention method
investigation). The proposed study will leverage a large and biracial contemporary birth cohort with repeated
blood collection from the mothers during pregnancy, cord blood collection at birth, and annual anthropometric
measurements of the children from birth to 4 years old. A total of 1,425 (953 black and 472 white) mother-child
pairs will be included in this study. A two-stage liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based
metabolomics approach, including an untargeted analysis with relative quantification (for discovery), followed by
a finding-driven targeted LC-MS analysis with absolute quantification (for validation) will be used to achieve the
Specific Aims: Aim 1) To identify both gestation stage-specific and longitudinal changes in maternal
metabolomic profiles during pregnancy which are associated with early childhood growth trajectories and
overweight/obesity risk at age 4; Aim 2) To examine the associations between the childhood outcome-related
prenatal metabolomic profiles identified in Aim 1 and the metabolomic profiles of cord blood; Aim 3) To examine
the associations between prenatal modifiable risk factors (e.g., gestational weight gain, diet, and smoking) and
the childhood outcome-related prenatal metabolomic profiles identified in Aim 1. This project will be the first study
to identify prenatal longitudinal metabolomic profiles associated with early childhood growth outcomes. It will
shed new light on the biological mechanisms of prenatal programming of childhood obesity and potentially
provide personalized intervention methods to curb the huge public health burden of childhood obesity in the US."
10772110,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in cancer genetics, alterations
in post-translational modifications are poorly understood. Protein glycosylation is the most abundant PTM and
altered in cancer. Glycans are not directly encoded in the genome but rather are comprised of up to ten
monosaccharides in various linkages to form thousands of structures, making their structural and functional
characterization challenging and largely unknown in SCC. To address this, I propose to use murine skin as a
highly tractable model system to study altered glycosylation, downstream consequences, and identify novel
therapies. In the K99, I will use glycan binding proteins, metabolic labeling, advanced microscopy, MALDI
imaging, glycomics, glycoproteomics, and single cell transcriptomics to spatially map glycosylation and identify
specific glycan and glycoprotein changes in a genetic, multi-hit, histologically progressive model of SCC from
papilloma to SCC, before chemotherapy, and after recurrence (Aim I). Next in the K99, I will use our in utero
lentivirus technology to transduce epidermis and perform a large-scale, unbiased, in vivo, functional genomics
screen of the ~700 glycogenes to define the role of glycosylation in SCC (Aim II). Lastly in the R00, I will combine
glycoproteomics, single cell transcriptomics of the tumor and microenvironment, protein-specific glycan editing,
and high-throughput drug screens to identify mechanisms of glycan-driven tumorigenesis and novel therapeutic
candidates (Aim III). My background in glycobiology, medical oncology, and mentorship from leading skin and
cancer biologist Dr. Elaine Fuchs at the outstanding training environments at Rockefeller University and
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, as a postdoctoral and medical oncology fellow, will position me to
tackle these important questions and learn techniques, knowledge, and leadership to establish a career as a
leading independent investigator and physician-scientist in cancer glycobiology."
10852818,"The practical goal of this project is to improve screening and surveillance strategies for Veterans living with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Although the risk
in each individual patient is highly heterogenous, the VA surveillance program currently examines over 90,000
patients with IBD colitis under a fairly rigid “one-size-fits-all” paradigm: recommended colonoscopy every 1-3
years starting with an index screening 8 years after IBD diagnosis with hopes to detect early, treatable colitis-
associated colorectal cancers (CA-CRC) before they are more dangerous. These intervals were based on
minimal evidence because trials are difficult to perform, and they have not changed in over 30 years leading to
thousands of unnecessary colonoscopies performed yearly in Veterans who have incredibly low risk of
developing CA-CRC. Our study will address critical knowledge gaps in this field including 1) inherited genetic
risk of CA-CRC in Veterans, and 2) timescales for cellular evolution that define ideal ‘windows of opportunity’ to
intercept early cancers in IBD. Our team has extensive expertise in building computational tools for assessing
screening and surveillance efficacy, deriving and validating clinical decision support tools for CA-CRC, and
analyzing genomic evolution in IBD colitis. Our study will provide an unprecedented level of molecular detail that
has not been achieved in any previous study of pre-cancer evolution in IBD colitis by leveraging thousands of
genomes collected serially from UK patient cohorts. We will focus on risk prediction for patients with IBD colitis
within the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and tailor risk prediction based on findings from genome-wide
association studies that we will perform in the sub-cohort who developed CA-CRC. An impact of this work will
be identification of genetic predictors of CA-CRC in Veterans using data from advanced multi-omic platforms.
 The long-term goal of this research is to shift the paradigm of cancer surveillance used both in the VA
and more broadly to move beyond fixed intervals that mainly rely on presence/absence of dysplasia toward a
conceptual model that incorporates cancer evolution mechanisms and genomics. Our main objective for this
project is to apply these techniques for Veterans with IBD colitis, and herein we will design a novel framework,
MOSAIC, for the Mathematical Optimization of Surveillance Ages to Intercept colitis-associated
Colorectal cancer. To modernize outdated guidelines, we will first understand how CA-CRC arises in patients
with IBD colitis using multiscale data, and then apply and validate this knowledge in a large VA cohort. The three
specific aims for our project are: 1) Quantify IBD colitis incidence rates in MVP and derive polygenic risk scores;
2) Create mathematical models for IBD carcinogenesis that include biophysical details for evolution; and 3)
Optimize patient surveillance strategies to effectively intercept CA-CRC. Through simulation of model-predicted
optimal versus standard surveillance scenarios, we will use our model to quantify the number of colonoscopies
avoided and the number of CA-CRCs successfully detected in early stages, and compare with MVP recorded
outcomes within the VA Clinical Data Warehouse. The proposed project is innovative because we will infer critical
evolutionary parameters in IBD colitis from genomic data for the first time, and we will build a novel risk prediction
tool that will incorporate population-level incidence trends, polygenic risk in MVP, pathology findings at
surveillance exams, and underlying evolutionary mechanisms within IBD tissue. This research is significant
because it is expected to provide predictive models that incorporate dynamic biomarkers of CA-CRC progression
in patients with IBD colitis to offer new strategies of risk-based surveillance. Importantly, study findings will inform
future prospective studies to evaluate the impact of our enhanced, model-informed strategy versus usual care
for identification of individuals who progress and develop high-risk lesions and CA-CRC on follow-up."
10773085,"Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older individuals. Importantly,
alcohol misuse has been associated with increased pneumonia for over 200 years. While the role of alcohol in
bacterial pneumonia susceptibility and severity remains to be fully understood, it is essential to define the at-
risk conditions and unique needs of those who misuse alcohol and to do so immediately in order to optimize
clinical care. Common in both active-duty and the veterans’ population, those with alcohol use disorders (AUD)
can be characterized by heavy cigarette smoking leading to pre-existing lung diseases such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major co-morbidity for pneumonia. Our knowledge about how such
characteristics impact this pathogenesis is limited. However, results from our previous lung alcohol research
have already demonstrated that AUD are associated with cilia dysfunction. Our results also demonstrate that
AUD results in decreased surfactant anti-microbial action. Surfactant protein D has been documented to
specifically bind to and aggregate bacteria for optimal microbicidal action. We hypothesize that altered innate
lung defense at the level of mucociliary clearance and anti-microbial surfactants will negatively impact
susceptibility and pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia, placing individuals with AUD particularly in harm’s
way. Our assembled team of investigators include a VA Research Career Scientist with 26 years’ experience in
the impact of alcohol on lung injury and repair, a VA pulmonologist whose expertise is on characterizing
primary human lung clinical samples, experienced alcohol liver injury researchers, and a junior investigator
who is already an expert in working with alcohol and bacterial infections. Our established expertise in mouse
models of alcohol injury combined with our existing biobank of human lung cells and tissues, we propose to
address our hypothesis by identifying any differences in S. pneumoniae infection responses due to alcohol
and/or cigarette smoking. We will specifically identify in these groups any changes in cilia beat controlling
clearance, surfactant protein D structure/function, and the role of reactive aldehydes generated by liver-derived
extracellular vesicles. Such studies will be performed for the first time in animal and cell models relevant to
AUD. Defining the modalities of risk will also empower clinicians to make informed preventive care decisions in
the context of alcohol misuse."
10757449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Normal mineral homeostasis is regulated by the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23
(FGF23), and vitaminD on the intestine,kidney andbone. Vitamin D is counter regulatedby PTHand FGF23: PTH
increases andFGF23 decreases circulatinglevels of thebiologically active formof vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D (1,25D), via opposing actions on the 1,25D-synthetic enzyme, CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase), and the 1,25D-
catabolic enzyme, CYP24A1 (24-hydroxylase). Despite compelling genetic and physiological evidence in humans
and animals that point to the critical importance of CYP24A1, most prior research of vitamin D in health and in
chronic kidney disease (CKD) focused on 1,25D synthesis by CYP27B1; much less attention has been devoted to
1,25D catabolism by CYP24A1. To advance research of CYP24A1, we developed new lox-P mice that enable
tissue-selective and inducible deletion of Cyp24a1. We will use this novel mouse line to test our overarching
hypothesis that tissue-specific effects of CYP24A1 in the kidney and intestinecontribute to normal and disordered
mineral homeostasis. Since the kidney is the main regulator of circulating 1,25D, we hypothesize that kidney-
specific Cyp24a1 deletion will increase serum 1,25D and downstream vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity in all
tissues, including the intestine and kidney. In CKD, this will cause hypercalcemia that suppresses PTH, but will
further harm kidney function due to 1,25D intoxication. In contrast, since the intestine does not contribute
meaningfully to circulating1,25D, we expect intestine-specific Cyp24a1 deletion to increase1,25D and VDR activity
only in the intestine. Resultant increases in intestinal calcium absorption will suppress PTH, which will lead to
decreased serum 1,25D and thus, decreased VDR activity in the kidney. As a result, we hypothesize that inhibiting
intestinal CYP24A1 in CKD will attenuate secondary hyperparathyroidismwithout causing hypercalcemia or further
kidney toxicity. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of CYP24A1 in normal mineral homeostasis by studying
mice with deletion of Cyp24a1 from the kidney (Six2Cre-Cyp24flox), intestine (VillinCreERT2-Cyp24flox) and globally
(UBCCreERT2-Cyp24flox). In Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that inhibiting intestinal CYP24A1 will attenuate
secondary hyperparathyroidism and downstream complications of CKD without worsening CKD. In Aims 1 and 2,
readouts of effect will include longitudinal physiological measures of mineral homeostasis and kidney function, and
expression of VDR target genes in the kidney and intestine; in Aim 2 we will also assess cardiac structure and
function, and kidney, bone and vascular histology. In Aim 3, we will define the molecular mechanisms of CYP24A1
regulationin enterocytes usingpharmacological and genetic approaches in mouseand humanintestinal organoids.
Readouts of effect will include cell signaling assays and expressionof Cyp24a1 and VDR target genes. By defining
the tissue-specific effects and molecular regulation of CYP24A1 using our new mouse models, we will uncover
novel therapeutic strategies for CKD and other syndromes of disordered mineral homeostasis."

 This proposal summarizes ongoing projects in our laboratory focused on natural product classes that
have promising biological activity but are burdened with limitations that have prevented them from reaching their
therapeutic potential. These classes are structurally complex and modification of their is challenging by
semisynthetic and biosynthetic methods. We aim to develop fully synthetic routes to these classes from simple
building blocks, enabling chemical modification to overcome their limitations. These efforts are informed by
binding data (X-ray or cryo-EM) for each class. The primary goals of project outlined herein are to 1) expand
structure–function relationships for each of these important classes of molecules, and 2) discover potent analogs
that are suitable for hit-to-lead optimization or for use as tools to study biological systems. Additionally,
development of the synthetic routes themselves is highly innovative, and is often accompanied by development
of methods that are broadly applicable in chemistry. These efforts mirror our work on streptogramin and
lankacidin antibiotics, which was a primary focus in our Early Stage Investigator MIRA (R35GM128656), and led
to structural reassignments and to a potent hit compound with activity against resistant strains in vivo.
 Much of the biology for this work will be enabled by collaboration. Five of the projects summarized herein
focus on the development of novel antibiotics that target the ribosome and membrane proteins. Due to our
ongoing work in this area, we have several collaborations in place to evaluate the antimicrobial activity, in vivo
efficacy, and target engagement of new analogs. Beyond antibiotics, we propose to synthesize and derivatize
classes that target Hsp90, an anticancer target, and eEF1A, an anticancer and antiviral target. Evaluation of
these compounds for inhibitory activity, isoform selectivity, and binding will be enabled by new collaborations,
expanding the scope of our research. With chemical innovation paired with strong biological investigation, we
anticipate that the work outlined herein will lead to exciting discoveries in chemical synthesis and to the discovery
of hit compounds for the treatment of bacterial infections, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2."
10849614,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Evidence from human imaging, postmortem analysis, and animal models suggests that atrophy of neurons in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of both neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative diseases. Structural changes—including retraction of dendritic arbors, loss of dendritic
spines, and reductions in synapse density—lead to functional deficits that manifest as impaired cognition,
decreased motivation, anhedonia, high anxiety, and increased impulsivity. Thus, therapeutic strategies aiming
to restore PFC structure/function have broad therapeutic potential. Psychoplastogens—small molecules that
promote structural and functional neuroplasticity in the PFC—produce both rapid and long-lasting therapeutic
effects after a single administration. However, many psychoplastogens, including ketamine and serotonergic
psychedelics, induce hallucinations, which greatly limit their therapeutic potential and clinical scalability.
Fortunately, increasing evidence suggests that the hallucinogenic effects of ketamine and psychedelics may
not be necessary for their therapeutic properties, and our group recently introduced the first non-hallucinogenic
psychoplastogens. The advent of non-hallucinogenic psychoplastogens represents an exciting new direction
for the treatment of many brain disorders, but there is an urgent need to further optimize their efficacy and
safety profiles. Our primary goals are to, 1) establish robust synthetic strategies to psychoplastogenic natural
products and chemical scaffolds that are amenable to medicinal chemistry, 2) develop high-throughput cellular
assays for assessing psychoplastogen efficacy and safety, and 3) advance new in vivo assays uniquely suited
to evaluate the long-lasting effects of psychoplastogens. Taken together, these efforts will enable structure-
activity relationship (SAR) studies of key psychoplastogenic scaffolds, filling the gap in our knowledge about
which structural motifs are critical for both psychoplastogenic and hallucinogenic effects. Ultimately, the work
described here will enable the rational design of safer, non-hallucinogenic alternatives to psychedelics for
treating a wide variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases."
10767786,"Impact of pre-analytic procurement and processing variables on the detection of HCC DNA in urine
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the world’s 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death and one of the
fastest-growing cancers in the US; 85% of patients die within 5 years, mainly due to late detection, limited
treatment options, and high recurrence. Currently, HCC recurrence and treatment responses are monitored
by serum AFP and serial imaging. Unfortunately, serum AFP can only be used for ~50% of HCC cases due
to low sensitivity. While MRI/CT imaging is the gold standard for diagnosis, it is expensive and less accessible.
It also has limited utility in the detection of small tumors (< 2 cm) and is challenging in the presence of
dysplastic nodules. Early detection of recurrent HCC is ineffective with the current available methods. Genetic
liquid biopsies have been routinely used in clinics for almost all cancer types as part of the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline. However, its usage in HCC is limited even though its
promises have been well documented in the literature, mostly for blood and some for urine. Our hypothesis
is that by establishing an evidence-based biospecimen practice for urine collection, storage, and transrenal
DNA (trDNA) isolation, urine HCC DNA analysis with tailored sensitive assays can provide HCC genetics with
more frequent tumor surveillance and treatment response assessment compared to current standard of care
for prognosis. As a pioneer in developing urine cancer liquid biopsies, we have established the standard
operating procedure (SOP) for urine collection for the Early Detection Research Network colon cancer
validation study (protocol ID: 320) and other non-urinary tract cancers. We have identified pre-analytic
variables that influence urine HCC DNA assay performance in the process of developing an HCC urine DNA
test for HCC liquid biopsies. In this application, we propose to use a liver-specific trDNA marker, hepatitis B
virus (HBV) DNA, which is found in urine, from patients with chronic HBV infection to validate and mitigate
these pre-analytic variables. Aims 1 and 2, will identify, validate, and mitigate pre-analytic factors, associated
with urine collection, storage and processing for trDNA isolation, and characterize of the size of trDNA that
influences clinical assay results and reproducibility. As a result, an evidence-based urine biospecimen
practice can be established to help support urine HCC DNA assay development, validation for HCC genetic
liquid biopsy and assessment of treatment response. In Aim 3, we will then demonstrate the reproducibility
and clinical validation of the utility of urine HCC DNA in assessing responses to HCC treatment. Developing
a robust evidence-based urine biospecimen practice for sample collection, processing, and long-term storage
will lead to the validation of urine tests for assessing HCC treatment in clinical trials."

Generating cells with different fates, functions and behaviors is critically important for the development and
maintenance of tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms. Cellular diversity can be generated through
Asymmetric Cell Division (ACD). Stem cells utilize ACD to create differentiating sibling cells while
maintaining the stem cell in the process. In addition to the asymmetric partitioning of proteins or RNAs, other
mechanisms such as mechanical cues, sibling cell size asymmetry or organelle asymmetry could
potentially also contribute to binary cell fate decisions.
 Here, I propose to use asymmetrically dividing Drosophila neuroblasts, the neural stem cells of the
developing fly central nervous system, to investigate the cell and mechanobiology of ACD in vivo. Recently,
we discovered that Non-muscle Myosin II-dependent cortical flows, induced through both polarity- and
spindle-dependent cues, are implicated in the generation of sibling cell size asymmetry. I will investigate how
cortical flows are induced and modulated with spatiotemporal precision to achieve reproducible sibling cell
size asymmetry. Our recent discovery of Protein Kinase N (PKN), and the Rho GTPase pathway as inducers
of cortical flows will provide molecular entry points. I will also investigate how cell size asymmetry contributes
to cell fate decisions, using RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and long-term live cell imaging in vivo.
 A second project encompassed in this research direction is aimed at investigating the molecular
mechanisms and function of molecular centrosome asymmetry, which is manifested in biased microtubule
organizing center (MTOC) activity in interphase. We identified new proteins and mechanisms, such as
Kinesins, Pp4 and dynamic centriolar protein localization in mitosis, regulating centrosome asymmetry.
Centrosome segregation is highly stereotypic in stem cells, but whether and how centrosome
asymmetry affects cell fate decisions, remains to be resolved. We will use fly neural stem cells to
investigate the mechanisms and functions of centrosome asymmetry during ACD. I am particularly interested
in investigating whether centrosome asymmetry provides a mechanism for biased cell fate determinant
segregation, either via asymmetric RNA or sister chromatid segregation. I will also investigate whether biased
MTOC activity impacts transcriptional regulation via chromatin organization.
 This research program will benefit from several novel and innovative tools, consisting of live cell imaging,
superresolution microscopy, RNA sequencing and acute protein mislocalization and perturbation systems
(nanobody, optogenetics), which my lab implemented to probe cytoskeletal dynamics with high spatial and/or
temporal precision in vivo.
 ACD is an evolutionary conserved mechanism and the proposed research program is medically
significant because defects in ACD can cause neurodevelopmental disorders or cancer."

The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls organ size and
tumorigenesis by regulating cell growth and death. We have shown that each component of the Hippo pathway
is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure. YAP, the nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway, is
transiently activated in response to pressure overload (PO) but downregulated during the chronic phase of PO
and heart failure. Cardiac specific downregulation of YAP inhibits cardiac hypertrophy but promotes heart
failure during the acute phase of PO, suggesting that endogenous YAP is salutary and mediates compensatory
hypertrophy during the acute phase of PO. Although YAP is downregulated during the chronic phase of PO,
forced activation of YAP at this stage is detrimental and promotes heart failure, due to de-differentiation of
cardiomyocytes. Thus, YAP can be either protective or detrimental in a context-dependent manner during PO.
However, it remains to be shown what makes YAP either salutary or detrimental during PO in the heart. Our
preliminary results suggest that YAP promotes compensatory cardiac hypertrophy by stimulating glycolysis
through upregulation of GLUT1 in the heart during the acute phase of PO, in a manner similar to aerobic
glycolysis, namely the “Warburg effects” in cancer cells. Here we hypothesize that endogenous YAP mediates
compensatory hypertrophy and survival of cardiomyocytes in the presence of PO through transcription of
GLUT1 and consequent upregulation of glycolysis and biosynthetic molecules. YAP acts cooperatively with
TEAD and HIF-1 and is involved in upregulation of GLUT1 that is activated during the acute phase of PO but
inactivated during the chronic phase of PO due to differential availability of the partner transcription factors of
YAP. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1. (a) Demonstrate that endogenous YAP plays an essential role in
mediating upregulation of glycolysis in response to acute PO. (b) Demonstrate that activation of YAP induces
accumulation of glycolytic intermediates through GLUT1- and PKM2-dependent mechanisms. (c) Demonstrate
that YAP-induced upregulation of GLUT1 is essential for the maintenance of glycolysis and consequent
upregulation of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in response to acute PO. 2. Demonstrate that YAP-induced
upregulation of GLUT1 is mediated through direct binding of YAP to TEAD and/or HIF-1 and resultant
cooperative actions during acute PO. We will use genetically altered mouse models, cultured adult
cardiomyocytes, metabolomic analyses, transcriptome analyses and ChIP sequencing analyses to address
these issues. Successful completion of this project will provide novel information about the molecular switch
that controls the glycolytic pathway and compensatory hypertrophy in the heart and how YAP differentially
controls signaling mechanisms to mediate both salutary and detrimental effects in the heart during PO."

Prion diseases are a family of transmissible neurodegenerative maladies that have no treatment and are 100% lethal. Transformation of astrocytes and microglia into reactive states is recognized as one of the major hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease including prion, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases. The vast majority of previous work on neuroinflammation associated with prion diseases has focused on reactive microglia, whereas very little is known about the role of reactive astrocytes in disease pathogenesis. Recent years witnessed a growing appreciation of the view that, like microglia, reactive astrocytes are intimately involved in chronic neurodegeneration. However, whether the reactive astrocytes associated with prion diseases are beneficial or detrimental is not known. The current project is designed to fill this gap and is the first to critically examine the role of reactive astrocytes in prion disease. Our preliminary studies in animals infected with prions reveal global dysregulation across multiple physiological functions including the loss of neuronal support function in reactive astrocytes. Moreover, reactive astrocytes isolated from prion-infected mice were found to exhibit deleterious effects on primary neurons. The degree of astrocyte reactivity was found to be predictive of the incubation time to prion disease, suggesting that phenotypic changes in astrocytes contribute to faster disease progression. Consistent with current knowledge that astrocyte reactivity is driven by the Stat3 transcription factor, we observed activation of Stat3 in reactive astrocytes in prion-infected animals. The current application will employ a novel mouse model, Aldh1l1-CreERT-Stat3-floxP, for conditional knockout of Stat3 in astrocytes to examine the role of reactive astrocytes in prion disease. Specific Aim 1 will examine the effects of conditional knockout of the Stat3 transcription factor in astrocytes on the pathogenesis of prion disease in mice. Specific Aim 2 will employ astrocytes and microglia acutely isolated from prion-infected animals to test the extent to which Stat3 knockout in astrocytes rescues their homeostatic functions; and impacts the reactive state of microglia. Specific Aim 3 will employ single-nuclei RNAseq to characterize the phenotypic heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes associated with prion disease. Upon completion of the proposal we expect to learn whether reactive astrocytes drive disease pathogenesis, and whether conditional knockout of Stat3 rescues important homeostatic functions of astrocytes and/or delays or ameliorates the disease. Thus, the results of this study will provide critical information as to whether astrocyte reactivity should be targeted as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating prion disease."

The goal of this program is to train MD and PhD postdoctoral fellows in biomedical research as it
applies to Blood Coagulation and Vascular Biology. We offer a multi-disciplinary program that
consists of didactic instruction, seminars and supervised research. Important elements of the
curriculum are supervision by faculty advisors, formal course work, interactions between trainee
and the faculty, and interactions between the trainee and peers. The Program is designed around
three distinct tracks. MD trainees choose between two tracks. The Physician-Scientist Track
consists of a minimum of two years of supervised bench research and didactic instruction after
completion of the major portion of hospital-funded clinical subspecialty training. The Clinical
Investigator Track prepares MD participants for a career in clinical investigation in the areas of
blood coagulation and vascular biology. PhD trainees participate in the Basic Science Track. The
design of the program takes into account (a) the need for physicians to acquire knowledge of
advances in molecular and cell biology, genetics, bioengineering, animal models, and systems
biology; (b) the need for an extended training experience to allow fellows to develop sophistication
in modern biomedical research; (c) the need for PhD scientists to understand the biochemistry of
the coagulation system and the pathobiology of the vascular system. Dr. Robert Flaumenhaft is
the Program Director and Drs. Sol Schulman, Kenneth Bauer, and Elisabeth Battinelli are
the Track Leaders. Faculty of the program, members of the Department of Medicine at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, share a scientific interest in
blood coagulation and vascular biology. MD trainees are selected from >100 applicants each
year. Only those applicants with an explicit commitment to a career in academic medicine are
selected. This grant, funded for the past 23 years, is a continuation of T32 HL07437, which had
been active at Tufts Medical Center for 20 years. This training program has proven
exceptionally successful. Over past 5 years, 82% of our recent alumni have remained in
academia and 18% are employed in industry. Of those in academia, half have already attained
federal funding for their independent research projects. This Program has, in the past 4
decades, produced leaders in the fields of blood coagulation and vascular biology and has had
important impact in sustaining basic research in the field of hemostasis and thrombosis."
10798116,"Project Summary/Abstract
This competitive renewal is based on work demonstrating that a subpopulation of endothelial cells (ECs) in
atherosclerotic plaques undergo a transition to a mesenchymal cell fate that involves loss of barrier function,
expression of inflammatory genes and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This transition is initiated by
inflammatory signaling that sensitizes cells to TGFβ, which then drives the mesenchymal fate transition. A key
consequence of the mesenchymal phenotype is production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix that amplifies
inflammatory signaling, recruiting leukocytes and production of cytokines. This sequence of events thus creates
positive feedback, a key feature of disease progression and resistance to therapy. Our work during the past grant
cycle has provided evidence that fate switching is driven by a minor subset of pre-existing, susceptible ECs that
drive vessel wall remodeling. Our work has also elucidated novel pathways by which matrix remodeling alters
integrin signaling to enhance inflammatory pathways and promotes disease progression. The overall goal of the
current application is to understand the EC subpopulations and factors that drive fate switching, and the positive
feedback mechanisms that drive disease. Aim 1 will elucidate endothelial heterogeneity in mice and in patients
with atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will characterize disease-prone subset of normal endothelial cells. Aim 3 will
elucidate the role of pro-inflammatory integrin signaling in evolution of EC populations in the atherosclerotic
plaque and the downstream pathways that mediate plaque progression."
10767843,"Project Summary
Exposure to persistent environmental toxicants (such as dioxin) is a global problem, but disproportionately
affects Veterans who were exposed dioxin derived from burn pits or Agent Orange. Dioxin exposure has been
linked to diminished fertility and an increased risk of preterm birth in both males and females, even when the
exposure occurred in utero. Recent studies indicate that female Veterans have increased risk of preterm birth
associated with recent deployment, underscoring the need for better diagnostics and interventions to eliminate
the risk of preterm birth associated with the unique environmental stressors encountered by Veterans.
However, little is known about the underlying molecular factors that contribute to this risk. We hypothesize that
exposure to environmental toxicants leads to perturbations in the host immune system programme which lead
to increased susceptibility to inflammatory insults (such as infection) that can lead to preterm birth.
Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a bacterium that can cause invasive reproductive
tract infections that lead to preterm birth. We have new and exciting data indicating females exposed to
toxicant have increased susceptibility to GBS infection leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We also have
strong data showing that toxicant exposure alters placental macrophage antimicrobial activity such as reactive
oxygen species production, and GBS survival within macrophages. We also have strong data which supports
that macrophages are critical mediators of immune homeostasis during pregnancy that also play a role in
invasive GBS infections. Placental macrophages elaborate extracellular traps in response to GBS infectious
insult and these traps are decorated with matrix metalloproteinases which are involved in the degradation of
cell-to-cell matrices in gestational tissues that are important for maintaining a stable pregnancy. This
translational research seeks to understand how toxicant exposure alters host susceptibility to preterm birth
(using invasive infection as a model) and contributes to disease progression by modulating the host immune
system. This knowledge may lead to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract
infections which often lead to preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, maternal bacteremia, and fetal demise as well as
ameliorate fertility issues associated with toxicant exposure."
10789859,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States and poses a significant burden to Veterans. The
effectiveness of current intervention approaches is limited and many individuals following stroke live with
persistent functional, cognitive and psychological impairments that significantly reduce long-term quality of life.
The prevalence of post-stroke disability coupled with reduced stroke mortality rates reflects an increasing need
to develop effective rehabilitation strategies aimed at reducing disability and improving quality of life for Veteran
stroke survivors. Aerobic exercise (AEx) promotes numerous functional, cognitive, and psychological benefits.
Additionally, AEx may enhance neuroplasticity through increases in circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and corticomotor excitability (CME). Emerging evidence also supports the use of AEx as a priming tool
to enhance motor outcomes following targeted rehabilitation. Our conceptual framework involves priming with
AEx prior to targeted motor rehabilitation to enhance the ‘neuroplastic environment” and make the brain more
amenable to adaptation, thereby enhancing response to rehabilitation. Specifically, we propose to pair AEx with
an upper extremity virtual reality rehabilitation game called Duck Duck Punch (DDP), developed by our team
(Co-mentor: Woodbury) as the platform for examining the adjunctive potential of AEx. Therefore the primary
aim of this proposal is to evaluate the priming effects of AEx on a motor rehabilitation intervention (i.e.
DDP) for chronic stroke survivors. This will be accomplished by examining a cohort of stroke survivors who
will be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks (3 sessions/week) of DDP preceded by either 15 minutes of AEx
(AEx+DDP) or a stretching control (CON+DDP). Assessment of physical function before and after the
intervention will provide insight into the ability of AEx to enhance the response to motor rehabilitation. The
secondary aim of this proposal is to gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie the priming effects of AEx
through assessment of circulating BDNF and CME. Additionally, since stroke survivors often experience
cognitive and psychological impairments we will also explore the influence of cognitive and psychological
function on response to AEx+DDP. A potentially exciting possibility is that AEx facilitates an enhanced
neuroplastic environment, which fosters improved function in a variety of aspects of stroke recovery including
physical, cognitive, and psychological function. This proposal will be supported by the infrastructure and
resources provided by the South Carolina Research Center for Recovery from Stroke (NIH P20 GM109040).
Furthermore, the combination of the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center and its affiliated academic institution,
Medical University of South Carolina is uniquely positioned to fill the aforementioned gap in understanding for
several reasons: 1) Charleston, South Carolina has one of the highest rates of stroke in the nation, and 2) in the
last 5 years we have received over $23 million in research funds to support rehabilitation research in stroke
recovery. During the award period, the applicant will capitalize on the opportunity to utilize these resources to
develop the requisite skills and understanding of neurobiological data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation
through direct hands-on training from local renowned experts. The overall goal of this CDA-2 application is
to expose the candidate to a rich local environment for stroke recovery research, providing the
foundation for his development into an independent VA researcher studying the effects of exercise-
based interventions, alone or as adjuvants, for the treatment of Veterans. To accomplish this goal, the
proposed training plan will enhance the candidate’s understanding of the neurobiological effects of AEx and the
design and delivery of neurorehabilitation trials. The data generated will inform the development of additional
AEx-based interventions aimed at improving function and quality of life for individuals following stroke and
perhaps other neurological or neuropsychiatric conditions."
10768574,"Project Summary/ Abstract: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent type of post-­traumatic 
epilepsy, causing significant morbidity in the veteran population. Approximately 60% of adult epilepsy cases 
are due to TLE, which is often medication-­resistant requiring surgery. Even after surgery, ~30% of patients 
continue to have ictal events. TLE causes cognitive deficits, including significant executive, memory, and 
neuropsychiatric dysfunction. After initiation by a precipitating event, a seizure-­free “epileptogenic” period

generate  pathological  electrical  activity  independent  of  the  initial  hippocampal  focus.  Together  with  other 
experimental and clinical observations, this strongly suggests that extra-­hippocampal cortical areas are involved 
in epileptogenesis. However, how cortical circuits get modified during epileptogenesis remains unknown. 
We  combine  chronic,  in-­vivo,  large-­field  (Mesoscopic)  two-­photon  microscopy  with  optogenetic  modulation  of 
specific  cortical  interneuron  classes  to  study  at  single-­cell  resolution:  i)  how  aberrant  activity  emerges  in

possible  to  interrupt  the  hippocampo-­cortical  cycle  of  epileptic  activity  by  modulating  optogenetically  specific 
types  of  cortical  interneurons. We  hypothesize  that  hypersynchronous  firing  of parvalbumin  positive (PV+) and 
progressively decreased engagement of SST+ interneurons emerges in cortical circuits during the epileptogenic 
period.  Pathological  circuit  dynamics  will  be  particularly  observed  during  the  200-­400  Hz  high  frequency

Sepsis is a major health challenge worldwide that is associated with a significant risk of mortality. The key to
improved outcomes in sepsis is earlier treatment once diagnosed, with delays in therapy being associated with
worse outcomes. Sepsis is a heterogenous disease, and thus despite decades of research focused on various
aspects of sepsis, there still remains much to be learned about the underlying mechanisms that result in
differences in outcomes. The utilization of biorepositories gives investigators the opportunity to study different
mechanisms of disease; however, it is imperative that we collect biospecimens early on in disease and at
different time point in order to understand disease trajectory. Furthermore, there are opportunities within
critical care research to diversify the patient population enrolled in studies in order to investigate disparities that
occur in sepsis. Thus, the need to develop best practices and standard operation procedures are required
that may serve as templates for establishing scalable and generalizable sepsis biorepositories. This proposal
aims to 1) develop an integrated multi-modal clinical, physiologic, volatilomic, and multi-omic biorepository
profile driven by a semi-autonomous screening algorithm to enrich sepsis phenotypes; 2)design and test novel
methods of biospecimen collection among enriched sepsis populations in both ambulance and acute care
hospital environments ; and 3)develop novel approaches to biorepository consent that match the clinical
context of sepsis, maximize representativeness among patients, and enhance trust and engagement among
patients and surrogate decision-makers."
10755739,"The controlled evolution of proteins in the laboratory is a valuable biomedical tool for accessing biomolecules for
industrial, therapeutic and research applications. This process, also known as directed evolution, allows one to
employ the specificity and selectivity that Nature imbues within its privileged biomolecules to construct unnatural
products that would otherwise be inefficient or laborious to generate chemosynthetically. While this process is
incredibly powerful, an existing bottleneck is the subsequent screening of the resulting variants for these high
value products. The directed evolution process typically generates hundreds to thousands of mutants or library
members for biochemical analysis. In some cases, fluorescent reporter systems or bioactivity assays can be
employed as a general biochemical readout, however, this does not inform on specific chemical transformations
towards diverse small molecule targets. When high value chemical products are the subject of these directed
evolution experiments, researchers employ multiple orthogonal analytical techniques, including: high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); gas chromatography (GC); mass spectrometry (MS); and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). This becomes time and infrastructure intensive when thousands of variants need
to be evaluated; even if variants are pooled in curated groups, considerable effort is needed for chromatographic
assessment. Additionally, many of these methodologies may not be sensitive or specific enough to necessitate
detection of low titer production of the desired product(s). Based on these shortcomings of the screening
platforms, we are proposing to leverage our labs’ existing strengths to develop a high-throughput,
specific, and sensitive mass spectrometry platform to screen directed evolution libraries for bioactive
chemical products without chromatographic separation. The McKinnie lab has expertise in synthetic
chemistry and biochemistry and has specifically worked on the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme
to construct neuroactive kainic acid on the gram scale. The Sanchez lab has expertise in natural product
discovery and mass spectrometry techniques such as imaging mass spectrometry and tandem mass
spectrometry. These respective strengths will allow us to develop an innovative pipeline for screening thousands
of directed evolution library members to prioritize variants that direct the chemistry towards kainoid-ring
glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists. Our pipeline will allow for unprecedented measurements in
chemical specificity and be broadly applicable for any groups looking to conduct directed evolution.
● Current directed evolution screening platforms are time-consuming or low throughput
● The combined expertise of our team is highly interdisciplinary
● Mass spectrometry and trapped ion mobility spectrometry allow for high dimensionality
measurements directly from mutant colonies without reliance on chromatography techniques"

Probiotic lactobacilli colonize mucosae and benefit human health by preventing infections,
reducing cancer risk, and improving metabolism. Among the lactobacilli, Lactobacillus plantarum
is one of the most widely studied probiotics. Lactobacilli use surface molecules called adhesins
to form physical associations with host tissues, and serine-rich repeat proteins (SRRPs) are one
specific class of adhesin used by probiotics and pathogens alike within in the Lactobacillaceae.
A key gap in our knowledge is how these proteins evolve specificity for their colonization site
within the host. This proposal investigates the hypothesis that cell-cell competition inside the
host creates an evolutionary selection pressure on SRRP genes to maximize bacterial cell
fitness inside the host. We investigate the first SRRP genes discovered in L. plantarum, which
we found to be necessary for colonization of a specific physical niche in the host digestive tract.
The proposal will examine evolution and specialization of the SRRP genes as well as the
functions of specific subdomains of the protein for their role in binding host mucus vs forming a
biofilm, vs promoting bacterial growth within the niche by enzymatically liberating host glycans.
We will use in vivo assays to connect the molecular properties of the SRRPs to cellular fitness
in the host. These assays include imaging the bacteria at single cell resolution inside the guts of
living animals to visualize the cell-cell competition directly. Success in this work could develop
an unparalleled model system to study the evolution of colonization specificity. Due to the wide
conservation of SRRPs in binding host mucus, this model may reveal conserved genetic
mechanisms that can be applied to develop better probiotics for humans and combat mucosal
pathogens."
10745344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Many forms of human dementia are caused by aberrantly folded proteins and protein aggregates.
Overexpressing these disease proteins, such as α-synuclein and TBD-43, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, also causes cytotoxicity, allowing unbiased powerful genetic screens for modifiers that enhance or
repress toxicity. Hence, this single-celled eukaryotic model has been a powerful genetic tool for discovering
molecular pathways regulating human dementia caused by protein misfolding and aggregation, such as the
Parkinson’s disease and frontotemporal dementia.
 Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated Tau proteins are a
major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as other neurodegenerative disorders
collectively termed Tauopathies. Despite the strong clinical association, how wildtype human Tau proteins
become hyperphosphorylated and cytotoxic remains poorly understood. Distinguished from other protein
aggregates that cause dementia, overexpressing human Tau is well tolerated in the budding yeast with no
apparent growth phenotype, even though human tau proteins are also hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in
yeast cells. Hence, no yeast genetic screen for Tau toxicity modifiers has been performed thus far. Yet,
tremendous potential remains if Tau-induced cytotoxicity can be reproduced in the simple yeast model,
permitting unbiased screens to uncover the molecular pathways involved in tau toxicity and related diseases.
 In a preliminary screen, we have identified several ORF deletion mutations that show toxicity when human
wildtype Tau (2N4R) is expressed. Interestingly, two of these mutant genes, THP1 and SAC3, encoding for
subunits of the evolutionarily conserved TREX2 complex, are involved in activating stress response gene
expression and mRNA export. Hence, we hypothesize that timely stress response at the transcription level
is necessary for yeast cells to antagonize the toxicity induced by misfolded Tau. It is also possible that
Tau proteins in thp1∆ and sac3∆ mutants adopt a cytotoxic conformation/state reminiscent of the situation of
Tau pathology in neurons. Indeed, our analysis of the NIAGADS database uncovered that AD-associated genetic
variants were found in four of the five subunits of the human TREX2 complex, making it one of the top 15 protein
complexes enriched for AD variants.
 For this small pilot project, we will 1) investigate the cause of Tau toxicity in strains mutated for TREX2
subunits using a combination of genetics, genomics and biochemical approaches; 2) develop a set of tools that
can help establish a novel Tau toxicity model in the budding yeast, allowing future unbiased screens for genetic
modifiers of Tau toxicity."

 Immunization with whole pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite and liver stage) Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
vaccines confers sterilizing immunity in human clinical trials. Replication-deficient vaccines, such as radiation-
attenuated sporozoites infect the liver as sporozoites but do not develop into liver stage schizonts. Replication-
competent vaccines, however, infect the liver and replicate as tissue schizonts. Multiple lines of evidence in
animal models of malaria have shown that protection is dependent on antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that
recognize liver stage-infected hepatocytes, leading to their elimination. Replication-competent parasite
vaccination confers superior durable sterilizing immunity against infection, and this appears to be, in animal
models, associated with broader and better CD8+ T cell responses. However, it remains largely unknown how
the distinct molecular cell biological features of whole attenuated parasite vaccines drive differences in the
priming of protective CD8+ T cells and of equal importance, which liver stage antigens are directly presented by
wildtype liver stage-infected hepatocytes that are the targets of vaccine-elicited protective CD8+ T cells. We will
address these critical knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we will identify the distinct time points during which the demise
of liver stage-infected hepatocytes results in optimal cross-presentation of liver stage antigens by antigen
presenting cells to CD8+ T cells. For this, we will use the Plasmodium yoelii (Py) rodent malaria model to inform
vaccine design of Pf, with which mechanistic host studies cannot be done. We will also determine at what time
points of wildtype liver stage development infected hepatocytes are most vulnerable to effector CD8+ T cell-
mediated elimination. In concert with this, we will determine dynamic liver stage transcriptomes and proteomes
throughout development and down-select the subset of liver stage proteins most prone to intrahepatocytic
processing and MHC class I-restricted peptide presentation. In Aim 2, we will directly determine the MHC class
I peptidome of Py and Pf presented on infected hepatocytes, specifically at timepoints of highest vulnerability
and test their reactivity with whole parasite-vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells. We will then test reactive epitopes as
well as nonreactive epitopes (covert epitopes) as vectored subunit vaccines in mice. As in Aim 1, mechanistic
testing cannot be done in Pf and thus we will conduct studies of Py to guide our Pf work. In Aim 3, we will
genetically engineer the ultimate Pf replication-competent parasite strain that is built with gene deletions and
dominant negative transgenes of parasite origin and will also over-express protective CD8+ T cell epitopes that
target liver stages at the point of their greatest vulnerability. Thus, in a multi-pronged approach our project will
develop the next generation of pre-erythrocytic vaccines including both vectored subunit vaccine candidates and
whole genetically attenuated parasite vaccine candidates, designed to generate optimal and durable protective
CD8+ T cell responses against Pf infection."

HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging next generation standard framework for
the exchange of electronic health record (EHR) data. The FHIR specification defines a common vocabulary
and mechanism for sharing EHR data independent of how it is actually stored. All of the major EHR vendors
are developing standardized FHIR interfaces to their clinical data. One of the exciting aspects of FHIR is that it
is among the first clinical data standards to incorporate the vision of the “Semantic Web” described by Tim
Berners-Lee in his oft cited article from 2001. In the article, he asserts that the Semantic Web is the next ""killer
app"" and outlines a formula for success: 1) Represent information and meaning in a single, universal format -
Resource Description Framework (RDF); 2) Create a catalog of URIs that serve as shared identifiers for the
RDF representation in a given context of use; and 3) Create tools for transforming existing data and knowledge
resources into the universal language of RDF and URIs. This allows information from disparate sources and
structures to be combined into a single, federated collection of “linked open data”. This linked data model
allows clinical data to be combined with other linked data such as environmental, genetic, geographic, and any
other relevant data and to be analyzed as an integrated whole. We have previously demonstrated that the
combination of RDF, OWL semantics, and the Shape Expressions (ShEx) schema language could theoretically
provide a robust platform for integrating disparate data models and paradigms under a single, resource
oriented collection of interfaces. The objective of this project is to design, develop and evaluate a novel
informatics platform known as FHIRCat that leverages Semantic Web technologies, FHIR models/profiles, and
ontologies for effective standards-based data integration and distributed analytics, enabling high-quality
reproducible clinical and translational research. Our specific aims are: 1) Develop FHIR ShEx/RDF
specification and tools for FHIR data validation; 2) Standardize and deploy the RDF-based data transformation
between external models and FHIR; and 3) Build and evaluate a FHIR ontology-based data access (OBDA)
system interoperable with clinical data repositories across institutions in partnership with the CTSA National
Center for Data to Health (CD2H). The outcome of the project makes it possible to realize Berners-Lee’s vision
for healthcare in the very near future, in turn creating new opportunities for advancing the automation of FHIR-
based clinical data integration and sharing, and accelerating standards-based data discovery and distributed
analytics in clinical and translational research.

An estimated 15% of AIDS-related deaths are due to cryptococcosis. We have genetically engineered a
Cryptococcus neoformans strain, designated cda1∆2∆3∆, that it is deficient in three genes encoding for chitin
deacetylases (CDA). Remarkably, mice given a single intrapulmonary vaccination with live or heat-killed
cda1∆2∆3∆ develop long-term protection against an otherwise lethal C. neoformans challenge, even if CD4+ T
cells are depleted at the time of fungal challenge. Other cryptococcal strains mutant in chitosan production, or
wild type strains grown in different media, also are protective, although some elicit deleterious proinflammatory
responses. The three specific aims are focused on developing a mechanistic understanding of the
immunological and vaccine determinants of protection. The long-term objective is to develop a cryptococcal
vaccine to protect at risk individuals, particularly persons living with HIV. Aim 1 is to determine correlates of
cda1∆2∆3∆ vaccine-mediated protection in CD4+ T cell-sufficient mice. We hypothesize that vaccination with
cda1∆2∆3∆ results in the generation and expansion of Th1-skewed antigen-specific CD4+ T cells which
orchestrate vaccine immunity by producing cytokines which recruit and/or activate antifungal effector cells. We
will dissect the cellular and cytokine response following vaccination and infection, interrogate the role of
macrophage and dendritic cells skewing, and define the cells and cytokines required for protection. Aim 2 is to
determine the effector mechanisms responsible for vaccine-mediated protection when CD4+ T cells are
depleted during the challenge phase. Our preliminary data demonstrate that CD4+ T cells are required for mice
vaccinated with cda1∆2∆3∆ to develop protective immunity, but then become dispensable when mice receive a
lethal challenge of C. neoformans. This plasticity suggests a strategy whereby persons with HIV can be
vaccinated when their CD4+ T cells are elevated and still be protected from cryptococcosis when their CD4+ T
cells counts fall. We will further define the requirement for CD4+ T cells and identify the effector mechanisms
that compensate for the loss of CD4+ T cells. Aim 3 is to determine the components of C. neoformans which
drive disparate host responses, focusing on the highly inflammatory response versus the protective response.
This aim follows up our discovery that whole cell cryptococcal vaccines can exhibit marked variations in the
amount of lung inflammation they induce. We will characterize the nature of the protective and inflammatory
response and determine the fungal ligands that drive these responses. We anticipate that at the end of the
funding period, we will have a mechanistic understanding of the host and fungal factors responsible for
protection of CD4+ T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice by the cda1∆2∆3∆ vaccine strain. The proposal
addresses a major global health need for the development of cryptococcal vaccines and could establish proofs
of principle applicable to other AIDS-related opportunistic infections and mucosal vaccines."

Ten to 20% of women have depression in the perinatal period (pregnancy through one year postpartum),
especially low income racial /ethnic minority women, yet many do not receive appropriate mental health
treatment. Low parenting self-efficacy and impaired mother - infant interactions contribute to health-related
burden and negative maternal and child outcomes. Yet these parenting issues are not addressed in current
primary care-based perinatal depression treatments. Our team has developed, with user centered design
techniques, a brief version of the evidence based Promoting First Relationships (PFR) parenting intervention:
PFR-B. We now propose to test a comprehensive perinatal depression treatment - Maternal Infant and Dyadic
Care (MInD) - that includes PFR-Brief in perinatal collaborative care, an evidence based intervention for
perinatal depression. MInD will be responsive to the needs of women in primary care settings where most
underserved women obtain prenatal care. By focusing on important mediators of worsened postpartum
depression (decreased parenting self-efficacy and impaired mother-infant interaction), MInD has the potential
to improve maternal outcomes, and in the long run, child outcomes. Our project specific aims are: Aim 1 To
compare MInD vs. usual CC in a RCT to assess depression outcomes. Sixty women with depression in
pregnancy will be randomly assigned to MInD or usual CC. We hypothesize that patients randomized to MInD
will experience significantly better improvement in depression (measured by the Edinburgh Postpartum
Depression Scale) at 3 months and 6 months postpartum compared to usual CC and that patients randomized
to MInD will have significantly better functioning as measured by Sheehan Disability Scale and Barkin Index of
Maternal Functioning compared to patients receiving usual CC. Aim 2: To explore the association between
parenting self-efficacy, dyadic interaction and depression to inform a mediational hypothesis. We hypothesize
that parenting self-efficacy will be greater and dyadic interaction will be improved in women randomized to
MInD post treatment and will mediate differences in depression outcomes between patients randomized to
MInD and usual CC. Aim 3: To examine relative utilization of MInD vs usual CC, feasibility of conducting the
trial, assessment burden and perceived match of treatment to patient need. We will use a mixed methods
strategy using the Working Alliance Inventory and in-depth patient interviews to compare MInD and usual CC.
We hypothesize that patients randomized to MInD will have higher utilization of treatment as measured by
attendance at least 3 antenatal and 3 postpartum CM sessions. We will explore the research question: How
do the treatment experiences of patients randomized to MInD compare with the treatment experiences of
patients randomized to usual CC? At the end of this project our multidisciplinary and complementary team will
be poised to conduct an R01 funded, larger Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation RCT to study the
effectiveness of MInD and prepare for implementation."
10799577,"Metal ions are essential to life as they augment amino acid protein
chemistry and thereby catalyze many difficult biological reactions. As “free” metal
ions are toxic and indiscriminately reactive, critical protein systems have evolved
to sequester, chaperone, and regulate metal ion concentrations. Defects in these
systems lead to metal ion metabolic disease and result in cellular, tissue, and
systemic pathology. The iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway contains a
conserved set of metallochaperone proteins that recognize and insert Fe-S
clusters into apo metalloproteins. We determined the first crystal structure for the
NFS1-ISD11-ACP cysteine desulfurase, which is a central enzyme in this
pathway that is also implicated in providing sulfur for molybdenum cofactor
biosynthesis and tRNA modifications. Interestingly, three distinct interchangeable
α2β22 architectures are now known for the cysteine desulfurase complex that
have superimposable protomers but distinct protein-protein interactions. In this
proposal, we aim to investigate the functional relationship between these
architectures, elucidate mechanistic details for sulfur transfer to different acceptor
proteins and for Fe-S cluster assembly, and provide new insight into the
regulatory control mechanisms for human Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. This
fundamental research will establish a framework for emerging genetic results and
discoveries and provide a basis for understanding defects in iron-sulfur cluster
metabolism relevant to human health and disease."
10799707,"Retinal neurons that form ribbon-style synapses operate over a wide dynamic range to continuously encode
and relay visual information to their downstream targets. These remarkable signaling abilities are supported by
a specialized presynaptic machinery, one component of which is syntaxin3B. Syntaxin3B is a retinal-specific
t-SNARE protein. It is also a Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated at T14 by
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). In the retina, phosphorylation at this site is governed by
illumination, while results of in vitro binding studies raise the possibility that T14 phosphorylation alters the
ability of syntaxin3B to form the SNARE complexes required for neurotransmitter release. We therefore
hypothesize that syntaxin3B has both an essential and a modulatory role in vision. In this research program,
we test this hypothesis and establish the roles of syntaxin3B and T14 modification in the mammalian retina. To
achieve these goals we use a powerful multi-pronged approach. Using modern in vitro fusion assays, we will
establish the role of syntaxin3B T14 modification in the catalysis of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and
determine whether T14 modulates a critical interaction with Munc18 known to facilitate SNARE complex
formation. We will also establish the effects of T14 phosphorylation on exocytosis in a tractable model cell that
utilizes STX3 and allows for direct, biophysical analysis of exocytosis and manipulation of T14 phosphorylation.
In the mammalian retina, we take advantage of a cell-specific STX3KO mouse line to examine the roles of
STX3B in multiple aspects of rod bipolar cell function, including from neurotransmitter release and calcium
channel activity, to active zone ultrastructure, and to the ability to relay visual information to downstream
neurons and across the retinal circuit. To this end, we use high-resolution techniques that include
electrophysiological approaches and electron tomography, in addition to assays of simple visual behavior.
Finally, we combine the cell-specific STX3KO mouse line with an elegant transfection method to directly study
the role of STX3B T14 modification in the rod bipolar cell. We will examine the role of T14 modification in the
modulation of synaptic vesicle fusogenicity, synaptic vesicle dynamics and short-term adaptation, synaptic
transmission and the throughput of visual information across the retina. Together, this research program will
provide a full picture of the essential and modulatory roles of STX3B in the retina and yield new insights into
the pathophysiology of STX3B-related disorders of vision."
10806174,"Workload-induced pancreatic islet β-cell dysfunction, loss-of identity, and cell death, commonly known as
β-cell failure, is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This disease usually starts with obesity-induced insulin
resistance, when peripheral tissues need higher levels of circulating insulin for glucose storage and usage.
Islet β-cells compensate by expanding β-cell mass and increasing insulin output per cell, which requires
upregulated insulin biosynthesis and oxidative glucose metabolism. These produce unfolded proinsulin in the
ER and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, which at high levels can decimate β cells. Thus, β
cells constantly activate stress response by stimulating the activity of several early-stage SRGs, including Atf6,
IRE1, PERK, Hsf1, and Nurf2, to lead to: 1) attenuated overall protein translation; 2) enhanced translation of
some SRG mRNAs that have special features such as upstream open reading frame (uORF) 5’ to the main
ORF; 3) upregulated expression of some late-stage SRGs. The overall effect of these responses is to remove
unfolded proteins/ROS for proteomic homeostasis and sustainable β-cell function. However, over-activating
some late-stage SRGs such as Atf4 and Hsps induces β-cell failure by turning on some proapoptotic genes or
by exceedingly lowering overall protein translation. Thus, it is imperative for β-cells to limit the levels of failure-
causing SRGs for sustainable high-level of insulin output. An emerging model from our recent published
findings is that a transcriptional complex containing Myt TFs and Sin3 can selectively repressing these failure-
causing SRGs. Myt TFs are a family of three myelin transcription factors (Myt1, 2, and 3) highly expressed in
islet cells. Sin3, including Sin3a and Sin3b, is a coregulator that represses transcription by recruiting histone
deacetylases (HDACs) to modify histones. We showed that Myt TFs and Sin3 can form a transcription complex
in β cells. Inactivating these genes in mouse and human β cells causes cell dysfunction and/or death while
overactivating late-stage β-cell-failure-causing SRGs but not early stage SRGs. Intriguingly, Myt TFs,
particularly Myt3, is induced by obesity-related stressors in mouse and human β cells, likely mediated by an
uORF in 5’ flanking region of Myt3 mRNA. Importantly, MYT3 down-regulation accompanies human β-cell
failure in T2D development. Our overarching hypothesis is that the stress-responsive Myt TFs, particularly
Myt3, promote -cell function/survival by repressing late-stage SRGs via Sin3-mediated histone de-acetylation
under both normal physiology and metabolic stress. Aim 1 will establish how MYT TFs repress SRG
expression in a human β cell line and how manipulating MYT-TF levels will affect primary human β-cell
function and survival. Aim 2 will define how metabolic stressors up-regulate Myt3 production and how this
upregulation enable β-cell compensation under metabolic stress. We expect to uncover a tunable mechanism
that can be explored for preventing/delaying β-cell failure and T2D."

Although close monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU care, both are
limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. Currently, dynamic and precise assessment of
patient’s acuity in ICU rely almost exclusively on physicians’ clinical judgment and vigilance. Furthermore,
important visual assessment details, such as facial expressions, posture, and mobility, are captured
sporadically by overburdened nurses or are not captured at all. However, these visual assessment details are
associated with critical indices such as physical function, pain and subsequent clinical deterioration. The PIs’
long-term goal is to sense, quantify, and communicate patient’s clinical condition in an autonomous and
precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to develop the novel tools for sensing, quantifying,
and communicating any patient’s condition in an autonomous, precise, and interpretable manner. The central
hypothesis is that deep learning models will be superior to existing acuity clinical scores by predicting acuity in
a dynamic, precise, and interpretable manner, using autonomous assessment of pain, emotional distress and
physical function, together with clinical and physiologic data. The hypothesis has been formulated based on
preliminary data and is well-grounded in clinical care literature. The rationale is that autonomous and precise
patient quantification can result in enhanced clinical workflow and early intervention. The overall objective will
be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning
algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the patient’s clinical status to determine if it is more accurate in
predicting daily care transition outcomes, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2)
Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous visual assessment of critically ill patients to determine
if it can provide accurate visual assessment of a patient compared to human expert, and if it can enrich acuity
prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Implementing and evaluating an intelligent platform for real-
time integration of autonomous visual assessment and acuity prediction in clinical workflow to determine
accuracy in real-time prospective evaluation and to determine physicians’ risk perception and satisfaction. The
approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise patient
trajectory, (2) autonomously perform visual assessment in the ICU, and (3) implement artificial intelligence
platform in real time in clinical workflow. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key
problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time prediction of clinical
trajectory, (2) manual repetitive ICU assessments, and (3) uncaptured patient aspects. Ultimately, the results
are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong
complications."

Ion channels are exquisite molecular machines that regulate the flow of ions across cell
membranes in response to stimuli such as voltage and small molecule ligands (e.g.
second messengers, and neurotransmitters). They underlie all electrical excitability in
the brain and heart, and defects in ion channels are responsible for many human
disorders. Despite decades of experiments and many high-resolution molecular
structures, we still do not know, for any channel, the mechanisms for voltage- or ligand-
dependent gating. The missing ingredient seems to be conformational energetics. The
energetics of the different channel conformations governs the time course, voltage-
dependence, and ligand-dependence of opening of the channel pore, and ultimately
electrical excitability of the cell. In this proposal we will determine the mechanisms of
voltage-dependent gating and ligand-dependent gating and fill important gaps in our
understanding of ion channel biology. We will focus on the cyclic nucleotide-binding
domain (CNBD) family of ion channels, which are structurally related, but functionally
diverse. Whereas some CNBD channels are activated by depolarization, others are
activated by hyperpolarization, and some members are activated by cAMP yet others
are activated by cGMP. We will leverage breakthrough FRET methods we developed for
measuring intramolecular distance distributions and conformational energetics using
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), simultaneous with recordings of
channel function using patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF). The data from multiple donor-
acceptor sites throughout the channels will be compiled into a four-dimensional map (X,
Y, Z, and energy) of the conformational rearrangements associated with ligand-
dependent and voltage-dependent activation of CNBD channels. Our long-term vision is
to understand the general themes that underlie allosteric regulation of ion channels, and
these experiments promise rapid progress toward this goal. Ultimately, the methods and
principles we discover will be of broad utility for elucidating mechanisms for all allosteric
proteins."
10861715,"Coordinating the timing of responses both within and between cells is critical for multicellular behaviors like
development. One way to evolve (or engineer) a molecular pacer is via induced turnover of transcriptional
repressors acting at multiple loci—a solution observed in diverse eukaryotes. Yet we know remarkably little
about how protein degradation kinetics translate into downstream transcriptional responses that lead to
outcomes like changes in cell fate. One possible reason is the lack of available models for high-resolution
structure-function analysis of degradation-linked transcriptional activation. We have leveraged the auxin
response, at the heart of nearly every aspect of plant biology, as a model to investigate general principles
underlying ubiquitin-mediated degradation and its connection to transcriptional activation and morphogenesis.
The small-molecule triggered degradation in the auxin pathway offers a unique advantage for these studies,
and has facilitated our engineering of auxin-induced degradation and transcriptional activation in yeast. Our
extensive work with our ‘AuxInYeast’ system has led to a central hypothesis: the auxin system functions as a
developmental timer in plants, and similar logic circuits act in many eukaryotes. One recent insight into the
molecular mechanism underlying the auxin timer was our discovery that transcriptional repression in the auxin
circuit, conferred by a Groucho/Tup1/TLE-type corepressor called TPL, requires interaction with the Mediator
complex. Our results suggest a new model of transcriptional regulation where corepressors can stabilize the
Pre-Initiation Complex in the absence of RNA Polymerase II, priming loci for rapid activation. In addition, we
have shown in transgenic plants that the rate of degradation-triggered removal of the TPL corepressor sets the
pace of de novo organogenesis in the root. Here, we will rigorously test the emergent model that corepressor-
based priming facilitates coordination of rapid transcriptional bursts at multiple loci across the genome, and
facilitates cell-cell synchrony during morphogenesis. Specific research projects will: (1) Deliver a high
spatiotemporal resolution, integrated, functional map of a single synthetic yeast locus transitioning from
repressed to active state, including composition/placement of protein complexes and chromatin modifications;
(2) Dissect the mechanism of a novel autonomous TPL repression domain we have identified that is found in
thousands of proteins, and quantify the impacts on repressive function of cancer-associated variants in select
proteins; (3) Build an in vivo cell fate tracker to probe the connection between synchrony in transcription and
morphogenesis. Together, the proposed work will provide a mechanistic framework for degradation-initiated
transcriptional activation in the auxin response, and potentially provide insights into fundamental properties in
common with many corepressor-primed systems. These insights can inform our understanding of degradation-
and transcription-associated human disease, as well as guiding future design of synthetic circuits using auxin
components for therapeutic applications."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers, primarily due to most cases being
diagnosed at an advanced, incurable stage. While 5-year survival of metastatic PDAC is <5%, outcomes
dramatically improve for localized PDAC. Poor prognosis is due to a lack of biomarkers for diagnosing PDAC at
an early, asymptomatic stage when cure is possible. Effective diagnosis of early stage PDAC depends on
identification of accurate, non-invasive biomarkers in combination with a strategy for screening increased risk
populations. Our primary objective is to identify non-invasive protein biomarkers in serum, urine, and exosomes
that accurately distinguish between patients with and without early stage resectable PDAC that is amenable to
curative surgery. Novel diagnostics would also improve discrimination between PDAC and benign pancreatic
pathologies. The goal of the proposed research is to develop clinically translatable noninvasive biomarkers-
based tests for screening (in high risk groups) and differential diagnosis of PDAC. Our central hypothesis is that
combinations of urinary, serum, and exosome derived biomarkers could be synergistic offering a superior
classification power. We have used urine and serum samples from retrospective and prospective cohort studies
to identify a range of strong candidate combinatorial multimarker algorithms for early detection and diagnosis of
PDAC. In Aim 1, we will optimize the performance of a PDAC differential diagnosis algorithm and will validate
the optimized algorithm in samples collected prior to clinical diagnosis in the Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Gene
Environment Risk (PAGER) study. In Aim 2, we will optimize the performance of an early detection algorithm for
resectable PDAC in pre-diagnostic samples from three prospectively collected cohorts and validate the optimized
EDA in blinded parallel serum/urine samples from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). If successful,
our project will yield novel, validated algorithms for risk assessment and early detection and for differential
diagnosis of PDAC. These algorithms when combined will result in a new pioneering screening paradigm for
PDAC allowing for timely live-saving interventions. Our strong preliminary data, powerful and synergistic
investigative team, and the availability of parallel urine and serum samples from unique prospective cohorts
contribute to the high probability of successful accomplishing the proposed studies."

Dengue virus (DENV) represents a major threat to global health. However, the precise role of the immune
system in protecting against and pathogenesis of the four DENV serotypes, which share antigenic similarities
and geographic ranges with each other and other closely related flaviviruses are poorly understood. In particular,
antibodies can contribute to DENV pathogenesis by mediating antibody (Ab)-dependent enhancement of
infection (ADE). This project focuses on defining the features of the anti-flavivirus Ab response that contributes
to ADE vs protection using epidemiologically relevant mouse models in which DENV infection of mouse pups is
enhanced by maternally acquired flavivirus Abs. Our published and new data demonstrate that flavivirus
vaccination-infection combinations can promote either pathogenesis or protection. Our preliminary data also
show that mice lacking T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses are unable to induce DENV IgG response, and
that mice treated with an agonistic Ab that stimulates OX40, a T cell costimulatory molecule belonging to the
TNF receptor superfamily, exhibit a boosted DENV IgG response, suggesting that the magnitude of the Tfh
response correlates with the level of Ab response to DENV. Therefore, we hypothesize that promoting Tfh
responses will increase the production of broadly-neutralizing Ab (bnAb) responses that mediate protection and
minimize ADE during DENV infection. We will test this hypothesis by using an RNA replicon-based vaccine
platform that induces robust T cell and Ab responses in the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine how
vaccination with different flavivirus antigens affects Tfh cell and Ab responses in maternal mice and susceptibility
to DENV ADE in their offspring. (2) Test whether manipulation of immunization variables and candidate T cell
costimulatory pathways boosts maternal Tfh cell and Ab responses and induces a protective response to DENV2
infection in offspring. These studies will provide critical insights into the factors and mechanisms that regulate
ADE vs protective immunity to DENV2 infection. This knowledge is urgently needed to inform development of
DENV vaccines that protect infants and young children, the highly vulnerable populations, and other flaviviral
vaccines that are safe and effective worldwide, including in countries with co-circulation of 2 or more flaviviruses.
The proposed work is based on our strong track record in investigating humoral and cellular immune mechanisms
during flavivirus infections using state-of-the-art mouse models. The project will also benefit from our
collaborators’ expertise in Tfh cells, T cell costimulatory molecules, flaviviral Ab response in humans,
development of novel vaccine platforms, and genomics assays."

Gliomas represent 80% of the 26,000 newly diagnosed cases of malignant brain and central nervous system
tumors in the United States each year and are among the most lethal and treatment-resistant human cancers.
Hot-spot, mono-allelic, gain-of-function mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 are
present in more than 70% of certain subtypes of gliomas, thus representing the genetic hallmark of these
malignant brain tumors. The ‘oncometabolite’ (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG], produced by IDH mutant
enzymes, modulates the activities of certain 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent DNA and histone demethylases,
which subsequently promotes neural cell transformation. Accordingly, broad changes in histone and DNA
methylation are strongly associated with IDH mutations in glioma. Despite these discoveries, the precise
molecular mechanisms linking oncometabolite-dependent chromatin remodeling with gliomagenesis remain
obscure. I propose to directly address this knowledge gap and test a new conceptual model to explain
oncometabolite-driven tumorigenesis. In Aim 1, I will perform time-resolved single cell and bulk RNA-seq and
ATAC-seq analyses of the molecular and cellular changes that occur during brain tumor initiation in a novel
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of glioma to reveal key mechanisms of (R)-2HG dependent
malignant transformation. In Aim 2, I will conduct integrative analyses of sequencing datasets from human glioma
samples and murine glioma samples from our GEM models to discover functional targets of (R)-2HG in IDH
mutant gliomas. In Aim 3, I will leverage novel mouse brain organoid models to investigate the impact of
oncometabolite activity on neural cell specification during brain development. If successful, my work will provide
a new conceptual framework for understanding the deterministic and stochastic functions of oncometabolite
signaling to chromatin and their influence on cell fate. This advance would deepen our understanding of how
metabolic alterations signal to chromatin in cancer and other diseases. Furthermore, identifying the molecular
processes that functionally link oncometabolites with brain tumor initiation may reveal new therapeutic targets to
combat this disease."
