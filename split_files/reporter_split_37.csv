Pediatric patients are more vulnerable to radiation exposure when compared to adults. Each year, 2.2 million
pediatric head computed tomography (CT) scans utilizing ionizing radiation are performed in the United States.
Head trauma and craniosynostosis are two of the most common pediatric conditions requiring head CT scans.
Multiple CT scans are often performed during clinical follow-up, exacerbating the cumulative risk of radiation
exposure. Head trauma is common in children, frequently resulting in a skull fracture. Craniosynostosis is a
congenital disability defined by a prematurely fused cranial suture. Standard clinical care for pediatric patients
with head trauma or craniosynostosis employs 3D high-resolution cranial CT images to identify cranial fractures
or cranial suture patency. The National Cancer Institute reported that radiation exposure from multiple head CT
scans in children has the potential to triple the risk of leukemia and brain cancer due to radiosensitivity of their
bone marrow and brain tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe alternative without ionizing radiation.
Existing “black bone” MRI methods rely on a diminished bone signal in a standard gradient echo scan to image
the skull. Though these methods have shown encouraging results, they have not translated into clinical practice
due to several challenges: motion artifacts, long acquisition time, and subjective manual image processing. Since
pediatric patient movement is very common, sedation has been routinely used to minimize motion artifacts in an
MR scan. Unfortunately, sedation is associated with risks including developmental delay and cardiopulmonary
complications. It takes several minutes to acquire high-resolution MR images, which can be challenging for
pediatric subject compliance and limits clinical adoption. Due to poor signal contrast between bone and its
surrounding tissues in MR images, existing manual signal intensity-based approaches are challenging and not
suitable for clinical translation. Our primary goal is to develop novel MR techniques to provide CT-equivalent 3D
high-resolution cranial bone imaging. Four specific aims are proposed: 1) develop motion correction to address
head motion in unsedated pediatric patients; 2) develop an MR image reconstruction method regularized by a
deep-learning prior to reduce MR acquisition time to 1 minute or below; 3) develop a 3D Bayesian neural network
to estimate pseudo-CT (pCT) and uncertainty maps from MRI for robust and automated image post-processing;
and 4) determine the clinical utility of pCT in identifying cranial fractures and cranial suture patency. This study
will have a profound impact on pediatric health by removing the risks associated with radiation and sedation."
10748425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Surgical outcomes for patients with intractable epilepsy are modest, in large part due to mis-localization
of seizure generators. Currently, epileptologists localize seizure generators by manually identifying the seizure
onset zone on intracranial EEG. There is also abundant interictal EEG data (between seizures) that is largely
ignored because, until now, clinicians lacked rigorous approaches to interpret this data. Recent work by Dr.
Conrad, her co-authors, and others, validated two quantitative methods to analyze interictal EEG: interictal
epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and functional connectivity (FC). This work demonstrates that quantitative
analysis of IEDs and FC reveals regions — referred to here as hubs — that help identify seizure generators
(Conrad et al., Brain, 2020; Conrad et al., Network Neuroscience, 2020). This proposed project will evaluate
IED and FC hubs in order to elucidate their mechanisms and their potential utility in surgical planning.
 The central hypothesis of this proposal is that epilepsy measurably alters the interictal network, allowing
us to probe seizure generators with interictal data. The objectives of the proposal are: to determine the
temporal stability and spatial correspondence between IED and FC hubs (Aim 1), to determine if these hubs
localize seizure generators (Aim 2), and to actively probe the interictal network with cortical stimulation to verify
hypothesized FC hubs (Aim 3). These studies will expand our understanding of epileptic networks. If
successful, quantitative analysis of interictal EEG will enhance localization of seizure generators and improve
surgical outcomes.
 This proposed project will also provide critical career development training to Dr. Conrad, an Epilepsy
Instructor at University of Pennsylvania. The proposal builds on Dr. Conrad's background in quantitative EEG
analysis and clinical epilepsy. Dr. Conrad will be mentored by Brian Litt, a world-renowned expert in
computational epilepsy; Danielle Bassett, a leading expert in network theory; and Eric Marsh, a leading expert
in quantitative IED analysis. The training plan in this proposal includes mentored completion of the proposed
research, as well as a rigorous program of didactics, workshops, lab meetings, and directly relevant clinical
work. Together, these experiences will provide essential training in time-series statistics, machine learning,
subject enrollment, cortical stimulation, and EEG data acquisition. This proposed project and training plan will
launch Dr. Conrad on an independent research career focused on using a multimodal approach to evaluating
interictal data in order to improve our understanding and treatment of epilepsy."
10748359,"Project Summary/Abstract. Recent estimates indicate that meningoencephalitis caused by the pathogenic
fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is responsible 15% of deaths in AIDS patients. Along with other fungal
pathogens, C. neoformans is therefore a major threat to the 37 million people worldwide living with HIV. A
complex of related species originally designated Cryptococcus gattii has recently emerged as a primary
pathogen of immunocompetent people. The long-term goal of our research program is to acquire
knowledge that will lead to new strategies to combat cryptococcal infections. In particular, we are working to
acquire a detailed understanding of the factors required for fungi to proliferate in vertebrate hosts. In
particular, we seek to identify new targets for therapy. Our focus is on iron as an essential nutrient for
pathogen proliferation and an important indicator of the host environment. Iron is especially important
because mammals actively withhold iron from pathogens through a process called nutritional immunity.
Pathogens must therefore be able to successfully compete for iron in order to cause disease. We have
shown that iron influences the growth of C. neoformans and also the size of the polysaccharide capsule that
is the major virulence factor. Our efforts have focused on characterizing the mechanisms of iron sensing
and exploiting the regulatory information to identify targets required for iron acquisition. The first specific aim
is to characterize the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 as a key sensor of iron availability. Grx4 interacts with
the iron regulator Cir1 and the proteins regulate iron homeostasis and the expression of virulence factors.
We seek to understand the mechanisms of iron sensing and how the iron signal influences gene expression.
A second specific aim will investigate the interaction of Grx4 with a network of transcription factors. Two
strong candidates have been identified (HapX and Gat201) and the interactions and regulatory influences of
these proteins with Grx4 will be characterized. A final specific aim is based on highly productive genetic
screens that identified components of the intracellular machinery for heme trafficking. Mutants lacking
trafficking functions for heme acquisition will be constructed and tested in mouse inhalation models of
cryptococcosis. Additionally, a heme sensor has been developed to detect heme availability in trafficking
mutants in culture and in cryptococcal cells during proliferation in different host tissue locations. Overall,
these studies will provide a comprehensive view the integration of iron sensing with the regulation of uptake
strategies that are critical during cryptococcosis.

 Like other cancers, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) arises from the accumulation of genetic
abnormalities that impair function of immature T-cell progenitors. DNMT3A, which encodes a de novo DNA
methyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the establishment of new DNA methylation marks on the genome, is
recurrently mutated in 10-18% of adult T-ALL cases and confers a poor clinical prognosis. We recently
showed using genetic mouse models that Dnmt3a acts as a T-cell tumor suppressor. Introduction of an
activating Notch1 mutation into a Dnmt3a loss-of-function genetic background (a common genetic combination
in patients) generated a lethal T-ALL with half the latency period compared to T-ALL with wild-type Dnmt3a.
Dnmt3a-mutant T-ALL blasts are resistant to cell death, both in vivo and under different stress conditions. This
suggests a major biological function of DNMT3A mutations in T-ALL cells is to make them “harder to kill”, and
the inferior clinical outcomes of these patients may be due to resistance to standard chemotherapy regimens.
We have now uncovered a potential mechanism to explain this which is conserved in both Dnmt3a-mutant
mouse T-ALL models and primary human DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL patient samples. DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL
cells are hypersensitive to cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-7, which results in elevated JAK/STAT signaling
triggering a pro-survival gene expression program. Specifically, we hypothesize that DNMT3A-mutant T-
ALL cells are resistant to apoptosis due to pSTAT5-dependent upregulation of BCL-xL. The goals of
this proposal are to understand the molecular mechanisms driving these phenotypes and exploit them for novel
therapeutic interventions. We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims;
  Determine the role of STAT5 and BCL-xL in the pathogenesis of DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL
  Define the role of JAK/STAT signaling in chemoresistance of DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL.
  Identify molecular mechanisms underpinning the functional phenotypes of Dnmt3a-mutant T-ALL.
 We will leverage preliminary findings to interrogate this hypothesis using a complementary combination of
genetic mouse models, human patient-derived xenografts, and CRSIPR/Cas9 genome engineering. In Aim 1,
we will evaluate the importance of STAT5 and BCL-xL for the development and maintenance of DNMT3A-
mutant T-ALL (both mouse and human) using state-of-the-art genetic tools. In Aim 2, we will use genomic
assays to understand how DNMT3A-mutant T-ALL cells are resistant to chemotherapy, and if JAK/STAT
inhibition can resensitize these cells to chemotherapeutic agents in vivo. In Aim 3, we will determine the
importance of DNA methylation at enhancers in the generation of pathogenic gene expression programs for
this T-ALL subtype, and evaluate the role of SHP-1 in conferring cytokine hypersentivity to DNMT3A-mutant T-
ALL cells. We will use the results of this project to inform design of rationally-targeted precision medicine
strategies for the treatment of T-ALL patients based on their underlying genetics."

 In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), people living with HIV (PLWH) face a new epidemic of uncontrolled
hypertension, the leading risk factor for death worldwide. Current care models in SSA are inadequate to
address the growing burden of hypertension in PLWH, yet few interventions targeting this population exist. We
previously piloted Community Health Worker (CHW)-delivered Hypertension Management Pilot (CHAMP), a
clinic-based hypertension educational intervention delivered by a CHW situated within a Tanzanian HIV clinic,
and found it to be highly feasible and acceptable. However, the efficacy and sustainability of CHAMP remains
unproven. In contrast, Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation (COBRA), a multi-component
intervention consisting of community-based CHW-delivered education and blood pressure monitoring and
protocolized referrals to physicians, demonstrated efficacy in improving hypertension control and reducing all-
cause mortality in a cluster-randomized trial across 3 countries in Asia. Evidence-based interventions like
COBRA hold considerable promise in achieving hypertension control among PLWH in SSA, but have not been
studied in this population.
 In this 2-year study, we will integrate an evidence-based, multi-component, CHW-delivered hypertension
intervention (COBRA) with our early experience deriving CHAMP to improve hypertension care and reduce
blood pressure among PLWH in Tanzania. Using implementation science methods, we will adapt COBRA for
delivery within the Tanzanian HIV clinic, examine implementation outcomes, and estimate effect size in
preparation for a subsequent large-scale, hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial across Tanzania. In Aim 1,
we will assemble a Design Consultation Team of key stakeholders to assist in intervention adaption.
Adaptation and integration of COBRA and CHAMP will occur iteratively over 8 months, guided by the ADAPT-
ITT model, and informed by our previously collected qualitative data describing barriers and facilitators to
hypertension care for PLWH. In Aim 2, we will pilot the adapted intervention with a single arm pre-post
feasibility trial in two HIV clinics and assess implementation (reach, adoptability, implementation, maintenance)
and preliminary effectiveness outcomes (hypertension control, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
antihypertensive adherence, cardiovascular disease risk score, and hypertension knowledge). Our research
team, comprised of experts in hypertension, HIV, and implementation science and our robust relationships with
community agencies and health systems make us well-suited to conduct this work.
 The proposed program will lay the groundwork for an R01 application to evaluate implementation,
effectiveness, and scalability of the adapted intervention in a fully powered trial across Tanzania and help stem
the rising tide of cardiovascular comorbidities among PLWH in SSA."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of conditions characterized by lipid accumulation in the
liver known as steatosis. Approximately 25% of the US population have NAFLD and approximately 30% of that
population suffer from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the more severe and progressive form of
NAFL that is characterized by liver steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, inflammation, and fibrosis. NASH is also
the leading indicator for liver transplantation in the US. Other than lifestyle changes, there is no current FDA-
approved therapeutic for NASH; however, one emerging target is the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). FXR is a
ligand activated transcription factor highly expressed in numerous tissues such as the liver and intestine and is
a major regulator in bile acid (BA) homeostasis. BAs have been implicated in NASH development and
progression and FXR deficiency in male mice leads to more severe NASH development. Because FXR
negatively regulates BA production, synthetic ligands that are whole-body FXR agonists have been developed
to treat NASH. Although beneficial, these whole-body modulators contribute to unfavorable side effects such as
cholesterol homeostasis imbalance, thereby explaining the importance of FXR tissue-specific activation in the
development of novel therapeutics for NASH to negate any potential harmful consequences. Our preliminary
data suggests that deletion of FXR expressed in the livers of mice is more critical in NASH development
compared to the deletion of FXR expressed in the small intestine. The underlying mechanisms leading to these
differences are not well elucidated. Understanding these mechanisms contributing to FXR functionality in a
tissue-specific and cell-specific manner will allow scientists to develop safe, targeted, and efficacious therapies
for NASH. In addition to determining which organ or cell type is most appropriate to target for the synthesis of
pharmacological interventions for NASH, deciding whether FXR activation or inactivation is most beneficial in
the treatment of NASH needs to be determined, particularly pertaining to FXR in the gut. Conflicting studies show
that both intestinal FXR agonism and antagonism are beneficial in the treatment of NASH. Aim 1 will determine
the tissue-specific role of the the farnesoid X receptor in NASH development in mice. Aim 2 will determine the
effects of ursodeoxycholic acid, an FXR antagonist, on NASH prevention in mice. Through the completion of the
research and training described in this F31 Fellowship, the Principal Investigator will be trained in basic
biomedical research and biological processes contributing to metabolic disease development and prevention,
focusing on NASH. The Principal Investigator will be prepared to conduct independent research and enhance
the diversity of the scientific workforce, and to assist in improving the health and quality of life of individuals
suffering from this chronic liver disease, which is in line with the mission and vision of the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases."
10897985,"Project Summary. A fundamental characteristic of alcohol use disorders is the loss of control over
alcohol consumption that results in progressively escalating levels of alcohol use and facilitates the
progression to alcohol-dependence. Given the comorbidity of alcohol dependence and disorders of affect
such as depression is extremely high, it has been posited that self-medication of negative affective states
contributes to continued excessive alcohol use and relapse. Furthermore, negative affective states
produced by chronic alcohol exposure can influence the neurocircuitry of cognitive control systems to
perpetuate further excessive alcohol use. Once that degree of dysregulation is reached, components of
the dependence cycle serve to facilitate each other in a manner that is extremely deleterious to personal,
familial and societal welfare. The principal investigator’s long-term goal is to identify effective
therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). The objective of this
application, which is the next step in pursuit of that goal, is to understand the neuroadaptations in Oprk1
(kappa-opioid receptor gene)-regulated systems that occur in response to chronic alcohol exposure and
contribute to maladaptive behavioral regulation. The central hypothesis is that the Oprk1-regulated
neurocircuitry becomes progressively dysregulated in a manner that promotes the continued excessive
consumption of alcohol and perpetuates the cycle of alcohol dependence. The rationale for the proposed
studies is that understanding the contribution of dysregulated Oprk1 expression in AUD will lay the
foundation for the development of effective therapies designed to alleviate maladaptive behavioral
regulation produced by alcohol dependence. This hypothesis will be tested by utilizing inducible and
conditional CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing and chemogenetic approaches to recapitulate or ameliorate
symptoms of alcohol dependence in non-selected and transgenic rats. Animal models of operant alcohol
self-administration, negative affective-like behavior and executive function including working memory
will serve as functional end-points to systematically investigate the role of Oprk1 expression in
maladaptive behavioral regulation related to alcohol dependence. In addition, Oprk1 gene expression will
be assessed as a complement to the behavioral approaches. The proposed research will help to identify
the functional importance of neuroadaptations in Oprk1-regulated systems that result from chronic
alcohol exposure and will provide much needed information regarding the influence of Oprk1 on the
neurocircuitry of AUD-related phenotypes. Such a contribution is significant because it will help identify
and develop therapeutic targets to treat AUD that focus on the removal of maladaptive phenotypes; a
strategy that should greatly increase treatment compliance and decrease rates of relapse."

It is currently feasible for small research groups to sequence individual genomes and for larger groups to
sequence tens of thousands of individuals. Unfortunately, our ability to identify variants that impact phenotype
has not kept pace with our sequencing capacity. This is particularly true of non-coding variants. This proposal
presents a pilot screen of more than 32K variants from myCode and ClinVar that suggest 1-2% of exonic
mutations affect splicing. The pilot study also revealed that splicing mutations are not uniformly distributed
across disease genes or even within genes. This proposal will continue this effort on variants from UK biobank,
AllofUs, ClinVar and GTEx that localize to actionable genes. Splicing mutations do not occur uniformly across
exons. The proposal seeks to map susceptibility to splicing mutations and identify hotspot exons (exons
unusually susceptible to splicing mutations) in the genome. In addition to identifying loss of splicing variants,
the little studied problem of gain of splicing variants (i.e. single base mutations that can activate pseudoexons)
will also be explored. Preliminary studies locate many intronic regions in pre-mRNA that contain all-but-one of
the numerous cis-elements necessary for splicing. In addition to mapping susceptibility to splicing mutations,
these efforts will contribute to the basic science of combinatorial signal recognition with a high-level approach
that will define mechanisms of splice site selection. Finally, we present a principled method of restoring splicing
to mutated exons using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that weaken flanking splice sites."

This application proposes a renewal of the Mouse Mutant Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) at The
Jackson Laboratory. Highly sophisticated genome engineering technologies, a well-characterized genome,
mammalian physiology and economical husbandry requirements make laboratory mice the mainstay of
biomedical research on disease mechanism and for disease modeling. The NIH has recognized that the
potential impact of genetically engineered mice for biomedical research cannot be fully realized without a
centralized effort to identify, archive, evaluate, characterize, and distribute valuable strains of mice to qualified
biomedical researchers. The MMRRC provides this centralized repository function. With over 80 years of
mouse genetics and mouse resource experience, The Jackson Laboratory joined the MMRRC in 2009 and
since has been a key member of the consortium. This proposal requests on-going support for The Jackson
Laboratory as one of the four MMRRC core repositories. As a member of the MMRRC consortium, the Jackson
Laboratory will contribute to the development and improvement of consortium wide standard operating
procedures. The MMRRC at JAX will follow these mutually agreed upon standard operating procedures to fulfill
the goals importation, archiving (through cryopreservation of sperm and/or embryos) and distribution of
biomedically important strains of mice and related materials. The MMRRC at JAX also provides related
services on a fee for service basis and conducts high risk high return research and model development
projects that fit within the overall goals of the consortium."
10764221,"Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major cause of congenital birth defects and causes severe disease in a
wide variety of immunosuppressed patient populations, including hematological cancer patients and transplant
recipients. We have found that HCMV institutes a pro-viral metabolic program that drives numerous cellular
metabolic activities to support the production of viral progeny. More recently, we find that the HCMV UL38
protein is necessary and sufficient to drive many aspects of HCMV-induced metabolic remodeling, and we
hypothesize that UL38 supports infection through its inhibition of the TSC2 tumor suppressor protein to induce
metabolic modulation. We will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by elucidating how UL38-TSC2-mediated metabolic
remodeling contributes to HCMV infection. In addition, we find that HCMV-induces the expression of neuronal
enolase 2 (ENO2), which we find is important for robust HCMV infection. We hypothesize that ENO2 induction
is critical for HCMV-mediated metabolic modulation, which we will test in Aim 2. Lastly, we find that both HCMV
infection and UL38 expression sensitizes cells to metabolic perturbations, revealing vulnerabilities that could
potentially be targeted therapeutically. We hypothesize that HCMV infection and UL38 expression induces a
metabolically rigid state that sensitizes cells to metabolic challenges, a hypothesis we will test in Aim 3. The
proposed work will broaden our understanding of an important host pathogen interaction, and given that these
processes are essential for productive infection, the proposed experiments will highlight novel targets for
therapeutic intervention."

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a debilitating problem in the United States with no FDA approved medications to
maximize success of treatment. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and over the
past year, cocaine use has increased 10% and a 26.5% increase has been observed in overdose deaths
involving cocaine. We endeavor to drive a fresh strategy to develop new pharmacotherapies for CUD. Using a
bottom-up strategy, we initiated a focus on the ventral pallidum (VP) which encodes reward and motivation to
represent a “final common pathway” for cocaine-taking. A gap in our understanding of the upstream neural
circuits regulating the VP hampers our efficacy in predicting strategies to suppress relapse and extend
abstinence from CUD. Our exciting new data suggest that a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway arising in the
dorsal raphe nucleus and targeting the nucleus accumbens converges into the VP to influence reward and
motivation processes. This novel pathway is regulated by the G-protein coupled receptor neuromedin U Receptor
2 (NMUR2), a putative “druggable target” for CUD pharmacotherapy. Our goal is to establish this neurocircuitry
as a central element in the upstream control of cocaine-driven behavior through the VP of the accumbal pathway.
To accomplish this goal, we will employ contemporary strategies including behavioral economics, GABA-specific
DREADDs and transsynaptic neuroanatomical tracing to detail connectivity through three integrated brain
regions. Overall, these studies will impact the field by laying the foundation for developing therapeutics to treat
individuals with CUD."

This MIRA proposal addresses two important avenues of discovery made by our laboratory. In
Part 1, we will examine the mechanism of allosteric activation by phosphorylation of the MAP
kinase, ERK2. This project advances the protein kinase field, by showing how protein motions
underlie the catalytic activation of ERK2 and how this impacts the action of high affinity
inhibitors. In Part 2, we will examine the mechanisms controlling the assembly and function of a
rear-polarized cellular complex, named the WRAMP structure. The WRAMP structure advances
the field of cell motility, as a new mechanism that controls the persistence of directional cell
migration and the direction of cell movement. The projects are unified by their dissection of
molecular mechanisms that control dynamics in cell signaling. This occurs at a microscopic level
by the molecular motions of protein kinases and at a macroscopic level by the assembly of
cellular protein-organelle complexes."

Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) in older adults is a leading cause of disability, excess mortality from
suicide, and dementia. Cognitive problems and sleep disturbances are common, contributing to recurrence and
poor long-term outcomes. Disrupted slow wave sleep is at the nexus of depression and cognitive dysfunction in
older adults. Novel approaches to target this core pathophysiology are lacking. Our mechanistic project,
Slow Wave Induction by Propofol to Eliminate Depression (SWIPED) Trial, is designed to elucidate the
relationships between TRD, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments in older adults. Through personalized
infusions targeting electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns, we aim for a systematic characterization of the
relationships between the propofol-induced EEG slow waves, enhancement of slow wave sleep, and cognitive
outcomes. Through the repurposing of propofol, this innovative proposal will establish whether EEG slow waves
are a viable therapeutic target for novel antidepressant approaches. The project consists of two clinical trials
(Phase 1 and Phase 2) in older adults with TRD. In Phase 1 we will enroll 15 individuals to receive a dose-finding
propofol infusion, and then a second infusion at the dose determined to induce slow waves. This phase will
establish that propofol both induces slow waves during the infusion and enhances slow wave sleep (SWS) on
nights of sleep post-infusion. Then, in Phase 2 we will randomize 60 individuals to multiple infusions of propofol
at either a dose that induces slow waves, or a subthreshold dose that does not induce slow waves, and we will
examine short and long-term changes in post-infusion SWS as well as executive function, alertness, and
depressive symptoms. This phase will test whether enhancement of SWS leads to improvements in cognitive
function and mood. This work will enhance our understanding of core deficits contributing to poor mood and
cognition in a population at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. With the rise in the aging
population, we hope to provide translatable biomarkers and approaches for future precision medicine, with a
long-term goal of improving public health and quality of life for those afflicted with TRD."

The Penn-CHOP proposal builds on collaborations and complementary expertise in phenomics and genomics.
The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) is associated with high risk for neuropsychiatric disorders across the
lifespan. The clinical presentation and course are markedly heterogeneous, with a range of developmental
neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD, Anxiety, ASD, and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders. Notably,
presentation and course resemble idiopathic disorders. Therefore, beyond the specific genetic syndrome
investigated, the proposed accelerated longitudinal design will identify convergent risk mechanisms for
developmental trajectories of neuropsychiatric disorders in the broader population.
 We are uniquely positioned to establish developmental trajectories during a critical period, adolescence and
emerging adulthood. Lacking in the literature of 22qDS is a systematic examination of environmental
exposures, which play an important role in psychopathology and neurocognition in the general population. The
nature and degree of medical burden have likewise not been examined in 22qDS. Taking a ‘genetics first’
approach of ascertainment based on a known deletion will allow us to overcome barriers posed by the genetic
and phenotypic complexity of idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. We postulate that 22q11.2
deletion exerts a large main and multifactorial effects on psychopathology, with contributions from multifaceted
environmental exposures and common and rare genetic variants. Dissecting these effects with dimensional
measures of psychopathology and neurocognition can elucidate the combined contribution of genetic and
environmental mechanisms to psychiatric conditions and build models of risk prediction. Our ability to pursue
such a large-scale study capitalizes on our existing successful collaborations, complementary expertise, and
institutional commitments to achieve these goals.
 We propose to parse dimensional measures of psychopathology, neurocognition, and environmental
exposures, to elucidate the architecture of risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in 22qDS focusing on the
emergence of psychosis. Prospective evaluation with dimensional measures relevant to neuropsychiatric
disorders will be applied to a cohort of 300 individuals with 22qDS and their parents, establishing trios. Thus,
we will examine family and environmental factors that can contribute to the heterogeneity of presentation and
developmental course in 22qDS. Recruitment for longitudinal prospective phenotyping will leverage an existing
large cohort with a wealth of clinical data, many of whom have already been ascertained and comprehensively
characterized with a range of phenotypic measures. We will also utilize existing genetic data from the largest
available case-control samples in the PGC to generate polygenic risk scores for the most common
neuropsychiatric disorders evident in 22qDS and examine their relation to outcome. This project will contribute
to common phenomic and genomic resources established for data sharing."
10777149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are T and B lymphocytes in aggregation with antigen presenting cells,
fibroblasts, and high endothelial venules observed in some chronically inflamed tissues. TLS formation in tumors
of cancer patients is associated with improved adaptive immune function and increased overall survival. In
surgically resected human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a significant proportion of patients form
spontaneous TLS in their primary tumors. Other groups have demonstrated similar findings, but no evidence
currently exists showing TLS directly influence T cell immunity. In this application we propose to investigate if
TLS enhance T cell immunity in the context of PDAC tumorigenesis and the mechanism of how this occurs. Our
preliminary data in TLS+ mouse and human PDAC tumors shows TCF1+ stem-like T cells (T-stem) are enriched
specifically within TLS relative to the surrounding tumor and stroma. We posit that TLS in PDAC tumors support
the development of stem-like T cell phenotypes (T-stem), dependent on interleukin-21 signaling. These unique
T cell subsets have previously been shown to sustain cellular immunity during chronic infection and cancer,
providing continual repletion of memory, effector, and terminally differentiated cells following antigenic recall or
immune checkpoint blockade treatment. We model this biology using a panel of mouse PDAC cell lines derived
from transgenic mouse tumors that conditionally express mutant KRas and p53, the most common driver
mutations in PDAC, and encode for a model MHCI-restricted antigen to track tumor antigen-specific responses.
These cancer cell lines, despite sharing a similar genetic and mutational background, induce tumors with unique
phenotypes and heterogenous tumor microenvironments. We will deploy a novel method to induce TLS in these
mouse tumors through lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR) agonism, whereby some of our mouse tumor lines are
permissive for TLS formation and others are resistant. We will test if the TLS-mediated generation of T-stem is
responsible for improved tumor control in CD8 conditional TCF1-knockout mice. We will determine if their
enrichment in TLS is due to IL-21 signals derived directly from TLS that promote their formation, independent of
lymphatic involvement, utilizing a combination of cell lineage tracing and genetically modified mouse models.
We will complement these studies by investigating tumor samples from PDAC patients for phenotypic pathways
unique to specific regions of these tumors. We will achieve this by performing spatial transcriptomics on human
PDAC tumor sections analyzed by an innovative algorithm that transforms spatial variable genes into functional
tissue modules to determine region-specific immune phenotypes localized to the TLS compared to non-TLS
regions and tumors without TLS. This approach identifies the mechanism of how TLS supports T cell function in
authentic mouse models of TLS+ PDAC and translates these findings to human cancer patients so novel
immunotherapy options designed to elicit and activate TLS can be offered to patients with a treatment resistant
malignancy."

between the viral proteins with the polyvalent formulation.
Aim 1. Determining the Effect of Polyvalent RSV Vaccine Formulations on Humoral Immunity using
Computer Simulations. We hypothesize that RSV polyvalent vaccine formulations consisting of different

will induce antibodies and immune cells specific to regions conserved between the antigens. mRNA-LNPs will
be constructed using cap-1, codon-optimized, structure-stabilized mRNA, encoding G or F from A2 or B1 RSV
variants and will be encapsulated using ionizable cationic lipids. Groups of mice will be immunized with either

hypothesize that vaccine formulations containing polyvalent mixtures of G or F antigens will increase the extent
of protection against RSV disease compared to monovalent formulations. Using different mixtures of mRNA-
LNP, we will test the ability of polyvalent vaccines to protect against disease severity using a murine model of
RSV challenge. The neutralizing antibody titer of the sera will be tested using a primary human lung epithelial
cell RSV-neutralization assay. Monovalent and polyvalent vaccine formulations will be compared by testing for
differences between infection and disease severity outcomes."

dysfunction, the fundamental question of how a clot forms in blood vessels remains incompletely understood.
Activation of blood coagulation enzymes requires a membrane surface containing anionic phospholipids, most
notably phosphatidylserine (PS). PS-binding proteins decrease thrombosis in animal models suggesting that
targeting PS exposure may be a novel antithrombotic strategy. Plasma membrane PS is normally sequestered
on the inner membrane leaflet. To activate blood coagulation, PS must be externalized to the outside of the cell
by calcium-activated phospholipid scramblases. Platelets readily externalize PS in vitro, and it has often been
assumed, but not clearly demonstrated, that platelets generate the procoagulant PS to promote thrombosis in
vivo. Our data demonstrate that (1) the majority of PS externalization in vivo actually derives from the vessel
wall, independent of platelets, and (2) inhibiting TMEM16 phospholipid scramblases decreases the thrombotic
potential of the vessel wall. We have identified two TMEM16 family members, TMEM16F, and its closest
paralog TMEM16E, that are both required for PS externalization and procoagulant activity in endothelial cells.
TMEM16E is not found in platelets and previously has no known role in coagulation. The central hypothesis of
this application is that the endothelial cell membrane is the primary source of PS in forming a thrombus, and its
externalization is regulated by two scramblases, TMEM16E and TMEM16F. In Aim 1 we will determine the
mechanism by which both TMEM16E and TMEM16F promote PS externalization and procoagulant activity in
endothelial cells. In Aim 2 we will use mouse models and intravital microscopy to determine the contribution of
endothelial cell-derived PS to thrombosis and how it is regulated by TMEM16E and TMEM16F in vivo.
 This proposal describes a five-year research training program for Dr. Alec Schmaier’s mentored career
development. The applicant has a strong research background in platelet activation from the Medical Scientist
Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania. This proposal expands his skill set through investigations

addition, the applicant’s advisory committee will provide highly relevant scientific expertise and critical
assessment of his progress. In sum, Dr. Schmaier has created an outstanding environment to advance his
research and career goals to be a physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine. This comprehensive training
program will position him to succeed as an independent investigator in thrombosis and vascular biology."

Chronic pain is both highly prevalent and a major cause of disability, affecting approximately 20.4% of the U.S.
Despite this prevalence, there are still limited therapeutic options. These issues are particularly true for pain
associated with trigeminal nerve injury. Recent comparative analyses support the presence of differences
between trigeminal and somatic nerves regarding the response to injury, and also point to voltage-gated sodium
channels (VGSCs) as a potential mechanism accounting for both the pain and differences in the efficacy of
available therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, VGSCs accumulation at the site of nerve injury and changes
in the relative density of subtypes in sensory neuron cell bodies have been implicated in the ongoing pain and
hypersensitivity associated with peripheral nerve injury. There is no consensus in the literature as to which of
the VGSC subtype(s) underlie action potential (AP) propagation along peripheral nerves, or which subtypes
underlie AP propagation following injury. However, there is evidence that the redistribution of VGSC subunits
along peripheral axons enables the nerve injury-induced pain and hypersensitivity, and therefore may serve as
a viable therapeutic target. In this regard, we have preliminary data suggesting that trigeminal but not the somatic
nerve injury is associated with an increase in functional NaV1.1 channels in trigeminal nerve axons that when
blocked, reverse nerve injury-induced mechanical sensitivity. Two general mechanisms have been implicated in
changes in axonal VGSC channels: protein trafficking and local translation of mRNA. While both mechanisms
are possible, at least two lines of evidence suggest local translation may underly the nerve injury-induced
increase in NaV1.1 in trigeminal axons. Thus, I hypothesize that the change in distribution of NaV1,1 in trigeminal
nerves following injury is due to local translation, and that the increase in functional NaV1.1 axonal protein
contributes to injury-induced hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, I will use a combination of techniques that
will elucidate the contribution of local translation and protein trafficking to nerve-injury induced hypersensitivity
in a series of experiments described under three specific aims involving anatomical and biochemical techniques
(Aim 1), functional endpoints (Aim 2), and behavioral endpoints (Aim 3). Results from these aims will determine
the basis for the nerve injury-induced increase in NaV1.1 in trigeminal nerve axons and their contribution to
changes in nociception. Future studies will address the implications for these results for novel therapeutic
approaches to the treatment of neuropathic pain. Along with the state-of-the-art facilities available, the highly
collaborative environment in the Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh will ensure the
successful completion of the experiments proposed. These studies will also provide me with the technical and
intellectual training required to become an independent investigator in the field of pain, while the commitment to
diversity in the CNUP will allow me to pursue my career goal of promoting inclusion in science."

The overall objective of this Phase II research and development work is to commercialize of a new software
product called MATH TEAM GAMES (MTG). MTG is being developed to enable the playing of collaborative
math games on mobile tablet and touchscreen devices by students of high school algebra in rapidly emerging
one-to-one (1:1) e-learning environments. In e-learning, 1:1 refers to both teachers and students using
networked mobile devices in either a traditional classroom where they are co-located or in a virtual classroom
where they are not (distance learning). In this proposal, the term “tablet” refers to any device with a
touchscreen where users write directly on the screen with a stylus or fingertip. Fluidity’s goal is to build MTG
using recently patented novel features designed specifically to broaden the use of their award winning product,
FluidMath, currently being used in traditional classrooms. Fluidity’s recently patented and patent pending
technology transforms the GUIs of networked tablets into a common work page (a virtual whiteboard) on which
students can collaborate using handwritten math notation to play math games. Teachers monitor student
performance on a teacher’s tablet connected in the network. Unlike any other game application, MTG
understands math input and enables participants to enter and collaboratively modify handwritten math notation
and/or hand drawn sketches on its common work page.
Currently, there are no team games which can be played on networked tablets that provide an intelligent
shared workspace for handwritten math input. MTG solves this problem and optimizes the significant
investment in tablet computers that is being made by educators for use in 1:1 e-learning environments. MTG
provides first-of-a-kind collaboration functionalities for use on a common intelligent workspace upon which
participants can interactively collaborate playing games using handwritten math notation and wherein teachers
can teach, observe, and evaluate their students’ collaborative problem solving (CPS) skills."

 The activity of chromatin-associating proteins (CAPs) is fundamental to regulation of gene expression.
Elucidating CAP activity is central to understanding the regulatory mechanisms that drive cell biology, both in
the context of health and disease, and to guide development of novel therapeutics. However, this work is not
straightforward, as CAP activity is regulated by multiple factors including post-translational modifications and
subcellular localization. Thus, assays to study CAP activity must specifically detect CAPs in their active form
(i.e., bound to chromatin, directly or in complex). Genomic mapping assays can provide detailed information on
CAP engagement and localization; however, these assays are inaccessible to a majority of researchers and
unsuitable for large-scale, high-throughput studies due to a high barrier of entry associated with cost, complexity,
equipment, and data analysis. Other existing assays to study CAPs capture total cellular abundance (e.g.,
EMSAs, ELISAs, IHC) or transcript levels (e.g., qPCR, RNA-seq), and do not specifically quantify CAPs actually
associated with chromatin in vivo. Thus, there is a field need for a high-throughput, low-cost assay that is
accessible to all researchers, and can inform CAP activity via quantification of in vivo engagement on chromatin.
Market availability of such an assay would be transformative for biomedical research by providing convenient
access to study the role and response of CAP in gene regulatory programs, including analysis of drug mechanism
of action and immune stimulus responses, as well as for high-throughput drug screening.
 Here, EpiCypher will develop QuantiCAPTM, a breakthrough assay that will enable the study of in vivo
activity of CAPs. The innovation of this proposal is the development of a targeted approach to directly quantify
the total amount of CAP-bound chromatin in cells. Our approach leverages an in situ immunotargeting strategy
to excise CAP-bound chromatin combined with highly sensitive detection by a fluorescent DNA stain. Overall,
this platform will provide the first quantitative, low-cost, and scalable approach to leverage analysis of CAPs for
biomedical research. In this Direct to Phase II research program, we are highlighting development of the platform
to study transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin reader proteins, though our platform will be broadly applicable
for the study of any CAP. In Phase I, we developed an automated QuantiCAP workflow, demonstrating feasibility
for the assay to quantify changes in a CAP following drug treatment, and identified assay conditions to further
improve sensitivity. In Phase II, we will extend QuantiCAP assay development to cover five (5) high value targets
using both manual and automated workflows, including genomics validation. We will validate our assays across
diverse primary immune cells and stimuli, then determine cell input thresholds, a robust normalization strategy,
and quantitative assay parameters. Finally, we will prepare for marketing and commercialization by developing
a QuantiCAP beta kit and applying the automated assay to perform high-impact drug development studies."
10763405,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Integrating high-dimensional and heterogenous biomedical data, such as electronic health
records (EHRs), molecular data, imaging, and free text, is a key challenge for making robust
discoveries that transform healthcare. Current work in the literature commonly analyze
biomedical data types separately, focus on small disease-related cohorts of patients, and rely on
domain experts and manual clinical feature selection in an ad hoc manner. Although
appropriate in some situations, supervised definitions of the feature space scale poorly, do not
generalize well, include inherent biases, and miss opportunities to discover novel patterns and
features. To address these issues, we will develop novel methods based on unsupervised
machine learning to derive low-dimensional vector-based representations, i.e., “embeddings”, of
medical concepts and patient clinical histories from large- scale, multi-modal and domain-free
biomedical datasets. These pre-computed representations aim to overcome common biases due to
population, supervised labeling, and specific hospital operation processes. These multi-modal
embeddings can be fine-tuned and applied to a number of specific predictive tasks,
improving scalability, generalizability and effectiveness of machine learning models in
healthcare. In particular, we will first develop methods based on unsupervised learning to create
multi-modal embeddings of medical concepts using heterogeneous EHRs, linked biobanks and
electrocardiogram waveform data, from the diverse population of five hospitals within the Mount
Sinai Health System in New York, NY, and publicly available medical knowledge. We will then
create a scalable framework to compute unsupervised multi-modal embeddings that can
summarize patient clinical histories and lead to subtyping and patient stratification. We will also
develop a federated learning system to share, visualize, and combine embeddings generated
separately at different medical institutes to capture a larger and more diverse population and
clinical landscape. We will apply embeddings to advance methods for EHR-based disease
phenotyping, onset prediction, and subtyping. While tested on EHRs, genetic and waveform data
from linked repositories, and medical knowledge, the proposed approaches will be easily
extendable to include other data, such as clinical images. This project will represent a step
towards the next generation of ML in healthcare ML that can (i) scale to billions of patients, (ii)
embed complex relationships of multi-modal data, and (iii) create less biased disease
representations by securely learning from patients across institutions via federated learning."
10774396,"We propose here a five-year R01 project to fully develop an integrated RF/shim/WiFi coil array and high-
resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) methodology for the detailed mapping of spine-brain pathways and their
connections to the brain. This project is motivated by the exponential growth in spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
in the recent decade to treat various brain disorders. Unlike other targeted neural stimulation approaches,
such as deep brain stimulations or DBS, SCS has the advantage of being less invasive, and has the potential to
achieve targeted precision in the brain if appropriate imaging methods can be developed to characterize the
underlying spine-brain pathways. While dMRI is the current method of choice to map neural connectivities, it
is not yet ready to image in the spinal cord due to the pronounced dynamic magnetic field fluctuations arising
from breathing-induced chest wall motions, in addition to the severe static field inhomogeneities at
air/tissue/bone interfaces. While static inhomogeneities would lead to geometric distortions that can be
largely corrected by improved shimming methods and post-processing strategies, dynamic field fluctuations
result in imbalance of the diffusion-weighting gradients and significant signal losses that cannot be corrected
at the present time. It is thus the goal of our project to develop the much-needed imaging hardware and
software solutions to address these challenges, and reliably acquire high-resolution dMRI images to map the
brain-spine pathways and their connections to the brain. Specifically, we will develop an integrated
RF/shim/WiFi coil array with automatic real-time shimming to synchronously compensate for the dynamic
field fluctuations, we will also develop innovative dMRI acquisition strategies to achieve high spatial
resolution with both high temporal throughput and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and we will map in
detail the spine-brain pathways and associated connections to the deep brain and to the relevant cortical
areas, and make these maps publicly accessible. We anticipate that this project will deliver critical imaging
technologies to enable high-resolution dMRI in the brain and spinal cord, which can provide detailed and
standardized maps of the spine-brain connectivities in vivo. It is hoped that these maps will improve the
current practice of SCS by allowing precise planning of the simulation sites in the spinal cord, thereby leading
to increased efficiency and effectiveness in treating patients with various movement and sensory brain
disorders."

mTORC1 stimulates cell and organ growth mainly by stimulating cellular anabolic processes, including protein,
lipid, and nucleotide synthesis, and inhibiting catabolic processes such as autophagy. Aberrant activation of
mTORC1 signaling has been linked to many human health problems, including cancer, neurodegenerative
diseases, and metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The activity of mTORC1 is tightly regulated by
growth factors and multiple cellular metabolic cues such as amino acids, where amino acids recruit mTORC1 to
the lysosome through Rag small GTPases activation, a key process for mTORC1 activation. Although recent
studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms by which amino acids induce the lysosomal mTORC1
localization and its activation via Rag GTPases, it has just begun to uncover how cellular lipids such as
cholesterol also regulate the activity of mTORC1. A recent study demonstrated that, in addition to amino acids,
lysosomal cholesterol also plays a key role in enhancing the activity of Rag GTPases through SLC38A9, the
guanine exchange factor for RagA/B. We discovered that BASP1 (Brain abundant signal membrane attached
signal protein 1), a known lipid raft cholesterol/PIP2-binding protein, functions as a key stimulator of mTORC1
activity. Mechanistically, BASP1 expresses on the lysosome in a manner dependent on cellular cholesterol and
interacts with and inhibits GATOR1, the GTPase activating protein complex for RagA/B, thereby stimulating
cellular mTORC1 activity. In addition, ablation of BASP1 largely diminished aberrant mTORC1 activation in cells
lacking functional Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal cholesterol exporter. Basp1
hypomorphic mice display a reduced developmental growth, reminiscent of mTOR hypomorphic mice or mice
treated with the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin. Interestingly, while adult Basp1 hypomorphs show higher insulin
sensitivity, they display resistance to diet-induced obesity. We propose that BASP1 plays a crucial role in
stimulating cellular mTORC1 activity to induce anabolic processes by sensing lysosomal membrane cholesterol
or other lipids and contribute to developmental growth and diet-induced obesity. This proposal will elucidate the
molecular mechanisms by which lysosomal lipids enhance BASP1 activity and how BASP1 inhibits GATOR1
activity and investigates the pathophysiological importance of BASP1 in developing metabolic disorders in mice
models. Completing this project establishes the role of the NPC1-BASP1-GATOR1-mTORC1 pathway in the
regulation of cellular anabolic actions and should yield valuable information to set additional experiments to
explore this new branch of lysosomal-oriented mTORC1 regulatory signaling in metabolic disorders and other
mTORC1-related human health problems, including neurodegenerative disease, lysosomal storage disorders,
and cancer."
10782481,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During adolescence, substance abuse and conduct problems are co-occurring and mutually reinforcing
problems with significant acute and long-term burden to adolescents, their families, and society. Family-based
treatments and prevention programs can reduce their incidence, but these interventions are limited in the size,
duration, and scope of effects and can be cumbersome to implement. One factor limiting the refinement of
these existing interventions is the difficulty of conducting rigorous science about the specific causal effects of
the family factors that are targeted as mechanisms of change. Factors such as parental monitoring, parental
warmth, and family conflict covary with each other as well as many other variables (e.g., genes, socioeconomic
status, living environment, parent psychopathology), so it is difficult to isolate their unique impacts on
adolescent outcomes from the larger causal network of risk factors. This proposal pursues a causally
grounded, mechanistic approach to disentangle the impacts of family processes and characterize how they
vary by the severity, chronicity, and developmental timing of exposure at the population level. We draw data
from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study—a diverse, longitudinal, nationwide,
population-based cohort of 11,880 youth ages 9/10 years old followed prospectively until ages 19-20, with
simultaneous measurement of many intercorrelated aspects of development at biannual assessments
throughout. We will attempt to isolate the effects of parental monitoring, parental warmth, and family conflict
from other influences using three distinct, and complementary approaches: (A) a between-subjects approach
using marginal structural models; (B) a within-subjects approach using the fixed effects panel estimator; (C) a
twin/sibling discordancy approach using 336+ pairs of monozygotic twins, 430+ pairs of dizygotic twins, and
1,805 non-twin siblings. We pursue four specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the causal impacts of three family
processes—parental monitoring, parental warmth, and family conflict—on proximal adolescent substance
abuse and conduct problems between ages 11 to 18 years. Aim 2: Determine whether the effects of the family
processes vary by youth sex, racial/ethnic identification, or predisposition to substance abuse and conduct
problems. Aim 3: Determine whether the effects of three family processes vary by severity, chronicity, or
developmental timing of exposure. Altogether, this research will yield a more scientifically accurate
developmental psychopathology of adolescent substance abuse and delinquency and thereby inform the
design, refinement, and personalization of family-based interventions to reduce the incidence of these
problems at the population level."

The goal of this proposal is to determine how the timing of sleep is controlled. Although the circadian clock
drives the 24 hour rhythmicity of sleep, the onset and duration of sleep is also determined by the extent of prior
wakefulness. The latter represents homeostatic control, which ensures that an organism gets enough sleep. In
a daily cycle, circadian and homeostatic systems are aligned, so sleep occurs at night following a day of
wakefulness. However, sleep loss at night or aspects of modern lifestyles, such as shiftwork or jetlag, can
cause misalignment of circadian and homeostatic systems. For instance, following a night of sleep deprivation,
homeostatic mechanisms will drive sleep in the morning although it is a time of circadian arousal. Even under
these conditions, the circadian system influences sleep and so will curtail the amount of sleep a night shift
worker might get during the day. Thus, interactions between circadian and homeostatic systems occur
constantly and are poorly understood.
Using a Drosophila model, we have dissected circuits by which the central brain clock controls rhythms of
locomotor activity. We now find that specific circadian output neurons we identified make contact with loci that
mediate homeostatic control of sleep. Our data suggest that the sleep homeostat suppresses circadian arousal
signals to allow sleep at the wrong time of day, e.g. in the morning following a night of sleep deprivation. In
addition, we find a rhythm of calcium in cells of the sleep homeostat as well as circadian regulation of their
sleep output. Rhythmic sleep output could be due to parallel effects of specific clock neurons, which drive
arousal at specific times of day, but together with the daily modulation of neural activity (calcium) in sleep
homeostatic cells, these findings provide us with a handle to determine how circadian signals are integrated
with homeostatic cues. To address the mechanisms by which these systems control the timing of sleep, we
propose to: (1) Determine how and when cells of the sleep homeostat act on circadian output neurons to
suppress arousal; (2) Determine how circadian and sleep signals are integrated in circadian output neurons.
As these output neurons also feedback to clock neurons, they play a critical role in linking the circadian and
homeostatic systems; (3) Determine how the clock interacts with light and homeostatic signals to modulate the
output of sleep homeostatic neurons.
Misaligned and disrupted sleep cycles have severe health consequences, including neurological disorders
such as stroke, so we expect this work to have broad medical relevance."

Many anti-tubulin agents, such as paclitaxel (Taxol), have been used extensively for treatment of
several types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, and breast cancers. Despite their wide use in
cancer treatment, however, patient response is highly variable and drug resistance remains a
major clinical issue. It is therefore essential to identify prognostic markers to predict the patient
response and to enhance drug sensitivity. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play significant roles
in cancer development, and many PTK inhibitors have been widely used for treatment of
malignancies and in clinical trials. We conducted Phos-tag-based biochemical screenings to
determine the regulation and function of PTKs during Taxol chemotherapeutics. In response to
Taxol treatment, one of the most significant changes in the PTK family is the marked protein
degradation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). In addition, FGFR4 controls Taxol
chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer cells. Importantly, FGFR4 expression levels are elevated in
recurrent post-chemotherapy ovarian cancer patients. These preliminary results provide a strong
premise in support of our hypothesis that the FGFR4 signaling functions as a therapeutic target
for paclitaxel-based chemotherapeutics in treatment of drug-resistant and/or recurrent patients.
We will test our central hypothesis by two specific aims. Aim 1: Determine how FGFR4 is
regulated during Taxol treatment; Aim 2: Targeting FGFR4 to overcome paclitaxel
chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The identification of new regulators and/or signaling
pathways triggered by anti-tubulin drugs will shed light on the mechanisms underlying
chemoresistance. Our study identifies the FGFR4 signaling as a potential therapeutic target in
recurrent ovarian cancer and suggests that combining selective inhibitors of FGFR4 (in clinical
development) with Taxol will have enhanced efficacy in the treatment of chemo-resistant and/or
recurrent patients."

Nervous system development and regeneration relies on sequential and coordinated formation of diverse
neurons and glia from neural progenitor cells. Though neuronal and glial differentiation is extensively studied,
less is known about the molecular signals that modulate the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis.
Oligodendrocytes, glial cells that support axon conduction and survival through myelination, are essential for
nervous system development and regeneration. During spinal cord development, distinct neural progenitors in
the pMN domain undergo a neuron-glia switch to sequentially produce motor neurons followed by
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Similarly, successful regeneration after spinal cord injury requires the
coordinated production of both neurons and oligodendrocytes to functionally restore damaged circuits. Zebrafish
are highly regenerative compared to mammals and endogenous neural progenitors produce motor neurons after
injury, but interestingly do not produce OPCs. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the neuron-glia switch
to specify neural progenitor cells into a neuronal or oligodendrocyte fate during development and after injury
remain unknown. Recently, our lab conducted fate mapping and single-cell RNAseq and revealed a molecularly
distinct subset of pMN neural progenitors, pre-OPCs, that are specified to commit to the oligodendrocyte lineage.
Our data revealed that pre-OPCs are uniquely enriched for factors involved in Wnt signaling, a cascade that
modulates OPC differentiation during development and that is reactivated after injury to regulate neurogenesis.
Using zebrafish, I will utilize immunohistochemistry and transgenic imaging techniques alongside CRISPR/Cas9
mutagenesis strategies to determine how axin1 modulates wnt expression in pMN progenitors to activate a
transcriptional switch in tcf7l2 and drive a neuron-glia switch to specify pMN progenitor cells into pre-OPCs.
Further, through powerful single-cell multi-omics techniques I will identify transcriptional interactions with
neuronal and oligodendrocyte-specific genes in pMN progenitors to establish a gene regulatory network that
drives the neuron-glia switch. Finally, I will use pharmacological and genetic tools to manipulate wnt expression
after spinal cord injury and induce a neuron-glia switch in vivo to drive gliogenesis in endogenous neural
progenitor cells. Together, these studies will uncover molecular regulators of pMN progenitor specification and
highlight the role of the neuron-glia switch in nervous system development and regeneration."

An estimated 1 in 2 US adults will have obesity by 2030, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The
highest risk of weight gain is among young adults ages 18-35 years. In-person behavioral interventions
generally produce clinically significant weight losses, but cost and reduced reach limit their ability to impact
obesity at a population level. Web-based interventions that mimic the structure of weekly face-to-face
treatment have proven a viable alternative, though weight losses are generally smaller than in-person
treatment. Mobile treatments have the potential for high reach, but have been less effective, producing 1-3 kgs
over 6 months. Newer digital intervention approaches called “just-in-time adaptive interventions” (JITAIs)
promise to improve upon mobile outcomes by offering adaptive, personalized feedback on behavior, which
consists of providing the “right type of support” at “the right time” rather than on a fixed schedule. This “just-in-
time,” or JIT, approach is made possible by the emergence of low-cost and widely available digital health tools
that allow for the collection of continually updated health data. However, to date, no JITAIs have successfully
targeted multiple weight-related behaviors (weighing, activity, and diet), and there has been no systematic
examination of what types of messaging interventions best promote adherence to these three weight loss
behaviors, for whom they are effective, and under what conditions. To address this problem, we will use a
micro-randomized trial to evaluate the effects of 7 types of intervention messages targeting specific behavior
change techniques (i.e., BCT messages) delivered in JIT moments on daily achievement of behavioral goals
among n=201 young adults with overweight and obesity. All participants will receive a 6-month behavioral
weight loss intervention using our Nudge mobile app, which includes evidence-based weekly lessons, tailored
feedback, self-monitoring, and daily BCT messages. Participants will receive a wireless scale, activity tracker,
and track “red” foods (high-calorie foods) in the app and have 3 goals: weigh daily, a daily active minutes goal
that gradually increases if met, and a daily red foods limit. At 3 decision points per day, participants will be
micro-randomized to receive or not receive 1 of 7 types of BCT messages. Each intervention message has
unique decision rules for availability. Candidate intervention message options have been carefully selected
from empirical evidence, tested in our prior studies, or are from our pilot micro-randomized trial. Assessments
will occur daily, and at 0, 3 and 6 months, to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effects of
each behavior change technique message (i.e., BCT message) on daily adherence to weight loss behaviors; 2)
Determine whether the effects of BCT messages on proximal outcomes change over time; and 3) Assess
whether the effects of BCT messages on proximal outcomes are moderated by participants’ contextual factors.
Findings will guide how adaptive, behaviorally- and contextually-dependent messages are incorporated into
future JITAIs for weight loss."

Adolescent sexual minority males, transgender girls, and gender diverse teens (ASMM/TGD; ages 13-18) are
disproportionately affected by HIV, accounting for 79% of new infections among this age group. Although CDC
and USPTF recommend HIV screening among teens, testing rates among ASMM/TGD are very low (1 in 4
ASMM; <1 in 10 TGD). Increasing HIV testing in ASMM/TGD is critical in mitigating transmission rates and in
linkage to care for those who test positive. Despite this alarming public health issue, few developmentally tailored
HIV prevention interventions exist for ASMM/TGD, and to date, no CDC best-evidence interventions for this
group are focused on increasing HIV testing as a primary outcome. G2G was a 6-week text message-based HIV
risk behavior reduction program originally designed for ASMM. Active treatment arm content focused on
providing HIV prevention information, increasing HIV prevention motivation, and increasing HIV prevention self-
efficacy relative to an information-only healthy lifestyle control arm. The G2G pilot RCT showed adolescents in
the active treatment arm were >3x more likely to report being tested for HIV at follow-up versus those in the
control arm, even though only a minority of messages focused on testing. We propose to update G2G with the
latest HIV prevention and testing science, make content inclusive of TGD, and test its effectiveness on the
outcome of validated HIV testing (e.g., photo of test result). Moreover, widespread adoption of digital HIV
prevention programs has lagged due to lack of attention to implementation throughout software development,
intervention design, and testing. For instance, who should implement digital HIV prevention/testing interventions
for teens (e.g., direct-to-consumer, clinics) remains an open question, and involving potential implementers in
the development process can ensure intervention success; best practices for updating content and technology
for digital HIV prevention/testing programs to prevent their obsolescence are lacking; and there is a lack of
consensus on how best to reach SGM adolescents for such programs. We propose a Hybrid Type 1 trial that will
establish G2G effectiveness and identify best practices for implementing digital HIV prevention/testing for teens
via three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will collaborate with a youth advisory council to add content reflecting our
increased emphasis on HIV testing and update gender inclusivity and cultural relevance of existing content. With
prospective implementers’ input, we will also modernize the G2G software platform with an eye toward
implementation. In Aim 2 we will test G2G effectiveness on HIV testing in a nationwide randomized controlled
trial with 360 ASMM/TGD aged 13-18. Finally, Aim 3 will convene a experts in ASMM/TGD youth research and
service provision to identify and achieve consensus in processes of, requirements for, and barriers/facilitators to
reaching and engaging ASMM/TGD for HIV testing/prevention. The goal of Aim 3 is to inform, develop, and
disseminate concrete tools to ensure HIV prevention programs reach ASMM/TGD. The panel will also
recommend potential implementation models and adaptations needed to scale up G2G in real world settings."

Extracellular histones are nuclear proteins released to the extracellular environment during tissue destruction or
injury. Emerging evidence implicates them as danger associated molecules with immunostimulatory capability.
The receptor-signaling mechanisms responsible for their tissue or cell-specific effects are poorly understood. In
recent studies, we detected elevated plasma levels of histones in burn patients as well as animals. Administration
of histones caused microvascular leakage and endothelial hyperpermeability-characteristic pathology underlying
multiple organ dysfunction following burns, whereas histone inhibitors attenuated burn-induced barrier leakage.
Moreover, we obtained novel evidence for the critical role of C-type lectin receptor 2d (Clec2d)-mediated tyrosine
kinase signaling in endothelial response to histones. Built on these intriguing findings, this study will characterize
the release, pathophysiological function, and molecular mechanisms of histones as an important contributor to
burn-induced endothelial barrier injury in edema-prone tissues, including lungs and gut/mesenteric microvessels.
We propose three aims: Aim 1 to characterize circulating histones in burn patients and animals correlated with
organ dysfunction; Aim 2 to determine the causal effects of histones on microvascular hyperpermeability during
burns; Aim 3 to explore the molecular mechanisms by which histones induce endothelial barrier breakdown. The
specific mechanistic hypothesis to be tested is that following thermal destruction of tissues, injured cells release
histones into the circulation where they directly interact with the vascular endothelium by binding to Clec2d and
activating downstream intracellular signaling mediated by Syk/Src-FAK; these tyrosine kinases phosphorylate
proteins that constitute cell-cell junctions and cell-matrix focal adhesions, thereby triggering their conformational
changes and leading to increased permeability. This novel pathway will be tested in innovative experiments that
incorporate newly developed imaging techniques and molecular assays into a comparative analysis of burn
patients, human organs, and animal/cell models. Through this translational study, we expect to gain new insights
that will not only shift the current paradigms in vascular endothelial cell biology, but also fill the gaps of knowledge
in understanding burn pathophysiology. Identification of circulating histones as a key mediator of burn-induced
tissue/organ injury may lead to the development of new diagnostics and therapies for thermal trauma."
10772131,"ABSTRACT
This project aims to understand of how mitochondrial carbon trafficking and bioenergetics are regulated by
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), a protein that is highly responsive to nutrient and energetic cues and
one that has received much attention as a potential therapeutic target. PDK4 is a member of a family of pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase enzymes (PDK1-4) that phosphorylate and inactive the mitochondrial pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (PDC). By converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the PDC connects glycolysis to the
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), which generates reducing equivalents needed for ATP synthesis. Notably, PDK4
is one of the most robustly induced genes/proteins in response to acute energy stresses–such as fasting,
exercise and consumption of a high fat meal. PDK4 is also strongly induced by acute exposure to fatty acids
and/or other ligands that activate the PPAR family of transcription factors. This remarkable level of
nutrient/energy-induced regulation is unique to PDK4 (as compared with PDKs1-3), raising the possibility that
PDK4 has distinct metabolic functions. The major conceptual innovation and central premise of this proposal
stems from new and exciting evidence from our laboratory that PDK4 phosphorylates and regulates proteins
beyond the PDC. Preliminary studies used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to assess the phospho-
proteome of hearts and/or skeletal muscles from mice in which the PDK4 gene was overexpressed or ablated.
In aggregate, the findings support a working model wherein PDK4 phosphorylates and regulates multiple
mitochondrial enzymes and proteins in response to lipid stress. Accordingly, the project seeks to test hypothesis
that PDK4 plays a central role in mediating lipid-induced phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins beyond the
PDC, which in turn modulates carbon trafficking and bioenergetics in manner that confers metabolic resilience.
To test this hypothesis, we will combine gain- and loss-of-function mouse models with several state-of-the-art
molecular profiling tools (mass spectrometry-based proteomics, phospho-proteomics, metabolomics and stable
isotope metabolic flux analysis), a sophisticated mitochondrial diagnostics platform, and comprehensive
physiological assessments to delineate the PDK4 interactome and its critical physiological functions."

The proposed work is for a cooperative agreement between the Iowa State University
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL) and the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine Vet-
LIRN program to provide support in the following areas:
1) To participate in FDA/Vet-LIRN sanctioned sample analysis for chemical contaminants.
2) To provide analytical data to support potential regulatory use.
3) To participate in additional projects such as small scale methods development, method
 validation, and matrix extension for analysis of chemical contaminants.
4) To participate in the Vet-LIRN AMR Monitoring Program as a source laboratory.
These activities are designed to support the FDA in strengthening coordination of veterinary
diagnostic laboratory efforts in enhancing the national food safety system.
The ISU-VDL is a full-service laboratory, fully accredited by the AAVLD, which provides cutting-
edge diagnostic services to the State of Iowa and beyond. The case load at the ISU-VDL is
unique in the nation because it is predominantly food-animal related. Iowa is a major food
animal producing state. The laboratory is not only the first line of defense in the area of food
safety to food animal producers across the country, but is also heavily engaged in protection of
companion animal health. This project will specifically address issues related to chemical
contamination leading to animal illnesses or death. A significant amount of our food animal
products from Iowa are exported overseas to the EU and Asia markets which are sensitive to
food safety. Participation in this cooperative agreement program will not only benefit the FDA,
but the lab and the State of Iowa as well because all aspects of this project add value to our
product, namely, accurate and timely analysis of test results to protect animal and human health
from chemical contaminants.
The ISU-VDL is well-equipped and staffed to positively impact the needs of the FDA as outlined
in the FOA. Specifically, we have the necessary infrastructure to support training, participate in
quality assurance processes and proficiency tests, and share data to support national capacity
development. We will quickly and accurately test diagnostic samples to assist the FDA in case
investigations. As members and long-term participants in the Food Emergency Response
Network (FERN) and also as founding members of Vet-LIRN, we have demonstrated that we
have the infrastructure to report out results accurately and efficiently. The quality of our work
product is overseen by an independent Quality Assurance Unit. In summary, we have the
resources and infrastructure to deliver our work product in a timely manner. We are ready to
collaborate with the FDA on this grant if the application is successful."
10783326,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research demonstrates that substance-use disorder, including opiate use disorder, affects one's decision
making and reward processing resulting in impaired goal-directed behaviors. However, there remains a lack of
understanding of the neurobiology that underlies persistent reward-seeking despite value changes that would
normally alter goal-directed behavior. The neuropeptide S (NPS) system, made up of the peptide and its receptor
(NPSR1), drives reward-seeking behaviors, however the underlying mechanism is not understood. We
generated both NPS-Cre and NPSR1-Cre driver mouse lines for accessing and examining the key circuit
components of NPS/NPSR1-mediated behaviors. I isolated a population of NPS-containing cells adjacent to the
locus coeruleus (LC) and found that these neurons project to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a region with dense
expression of NPSR1. I found that these neurons respond to delivery of reward-predictive cues as well as
consumption, but to a lesser extent. I then preliminarily tested the effects of oral fentanyl self-administration on
this population and uncovered a bidirectional response to delivery of the conditioned stimulus (enhanced
activity), and fentanyl reward (quiescence). In this proposal, I first aim to determine the dynamics of OFCNPSR1
neuronal ensembles during natural- and drug-seeking behaviors (Aim 1) using two-photon microscopy.
This aim seeks to further investigate OFCNPSR1 activity during self-administration of fentanyl reward as well as
how devaluation of either a natural or drug reward is modulated by OFCNPSR1 activity. My second aim is to
examine how hindbrain NPS neuron activity and neuropeptide release impact OFC encoding during
reward-seeking behaviors (Aim 2). This aim serves to close this gap in knowledge by using multi-site fiber
photometry to simultaneously image hindbrain NPS, and OFC neuron activity during reward-seeking behaviors.
Finally, in the R00 portion of this grant, I will expand the scope of this study by determining the sufficiency of
the OFCNPSR1-Basolateral Amygdala (BLA) projection in driving drug-seeking behaviors (Aim 3). I found
that OFCNPSR1 neurons are connected with the BLA. In addition, the BLA expresses NPSR1, however, the source
of endogenous NPS to the BLA is unknown as well as any modulation the OFCNPSR1 neurons may provide to this
region. This aim serves to uncover the source of BLA NPS as well as investigate the role of BLANPSR1 neurons in
reward-seeking behavior and how this activity may be affected by OFCNPSR1 projections. I will utilize a series of
complimentary cutting-edge neuroscience techniques to dissect the role of the OFCNPSR1 neurons in drug-
seeking behavior. The central goal is to aid in future investigation of whether NPS signaling represents an
important avenue for altering drug-seeking behavior. This proposal provides substantial new training in SLM, in
vivo calcium imaging of network and single-cell activity, neuropharmacological and molecular viral manipulations,
and career development skills for transition as an independent academic investigator."
10928177,"ABSTRACT: UNDERSTANDING GENETIC COMPLEXITY IN SPINA BIFIDA
 Among neural tube defects (NTDs), myelomeningocele (spina bifida:SB), is a devastating but survivable,
human structural malformation. Up to 70% of SB cases are attributed to genetic predisposition, with intrauterine
environment precipitating SB manifestation in those at risk. Despite decades of research into genetic factors that
underlie NTDs in mouse models, translation to human risk assessment and amelioration of SB cases remain
elusive. This is largely attributable to limitations of the typical candidate gene approaches used in genetic studies
of human NTDs. Here, our comprehensive systems biology approach to mutation burden in whole genome
sequence (WGS) analyses is illuminating molecular pathways to human SB through interrogation of protein
coding and non-coding regions, and introduces machine learning to select, in an untargeted fashion, genes with
SB discriminatory potential based on gene enrichment by rare, likely deleterious protein coding variants.
 The project extends our comprehensive genomic effort, generating new WGS on 200 recently collected
patient-parent trio (600 genomes) samples. Studies aim to identify specific gene drivers of human SB, illuminate
gene-gene interactions leading to SB, and improve mechanistic understanding of this complex birth defect.
 Aim 1 uses family study and systems biology approaches to seek genes with transmitted or de novo rare
variants suggesting SB-association. This begins assessment of parental vs de novo, “second hit”, contributions
to SB. Analyses include protein-coding and noncoding sequence single nucleotide variants (SNVs), rare copy
number variants (rCNVs), and state-of-the art computational probes leveraging genome 3D structure.
 Aim 2 tests the functional significance and interactions of these detected genes and variations to: (a) use
CRISPR edited isogenic, double heterozygous human stem cells in a novel SOSRS, 3-D in vitro method to
evaluate proliferation, self-organization, and differentiation, (b) test the transcriptional impact of these mutations
using bulk and single cell RNAseq in mutagenized cells.
 Aim 3 examines double/multiple-heterozygous protein coding mutations using existing and CRISPR-
edited mice to test the histological and gene expression impact of gene interactions on NT closure.
 Our computational approaches are highly innovative in the field, using machine learning to build network
models of human SB risk. We then apply advanced technology for the functional testing of these genetic risk
models, including gene editing of human stem cells, compared to isogenic controls, and mice for cellular and
systems based hypothesis testing in vitro and in vivo, along with evaluation of the cell-type gene expression
changes induced by these variants. Insights from our studies will pave the way for a precision medicine capability
to individualize NTD prevention and care for families and the hundreds of thousands of patients living with SB."
10929476,"This proposal addresses one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in vision: the molecular and cellular
mechanism responsible for building and maintaining the light-sensitive organelle of vertebrate photoreceptor cells,
the outer segment. The outer segment is a ciliary structure filled with a stack of disc membranes, which provide
vast surfaces for light capture and harbor proteins comprising the phototransduction machinery. Discs are renewed
on a daily basis in order to counteract the adverse effects of light exposure, and the fidelity of disc renewal is critical
for maintaining photoreceptor health and normal vision. It is now well-established that the formation of each new
disc begins with an evagination of the ciliary plasma membrane driven by an expansion of branched actin network
in a mechanism akin the formation of lamellipodia in motile cells. What remain entirely unknown are the molecular
mechanism that initiate the formation of each new disc with the striking periodicity of approximately 80 times per
day in mammals. Pinpointing this mechanism is the overall goal of this application. Our recent work shows that this
actin network is nucleated by the WAVE protein complex whose unique subunit composition is specifically fitted to
perform this function. Because WAVE complexes mediate between the upstream signaling pathways and
downstream actin networks, this opens doors to elucidating the entire mechanism responsible for the periodic
assembly and disassembly of actin at the disc morphogenesis site. To accomplish this goal, we will combine the
efforts of two laboratories, which will contribute unique expertise and two complementary models of genetically
modified animals: mice and Xenopus frogs. Our proposed experiments will investigate the regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton dynamics, including that in living photoreceptors, by two classes of regulatory molecules: small
GTPases and phosphoinositides. Elucidating these mechanisms is critical for advancing our understanding of basic
photoreceptor cell biology and pathobiological mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration frequently
associated with defects in outer segment morphogenesis."
11076176,"One of the most prevalent diseases is atrial fibrillation (AF), which contributes to at least 180,000 deaths annually
and is expected to affect twelve million people in the U.S. by 2030. Excessive atrial fibrosis increases resistance
to therapy and decreases AF-free survival in AF patients by creating a substrate for atrial reentrant arrhythmias.
Increased interstitial fibrosis is caused by dysfunctional atrial cardio-fibroblasts (ACFs) that secrete excessive
collagen into the extracellular matrix. However, detailed molecular mechanisms of the signaling pathways
regulating ACFs are yet to be uncovered, which could enable the development of a novel treatment for AF. The
Wehrens Lab in collaboration with Dr. Reilly (Univ. of Oxford) has recently identified calcitonin (CT) as a paracrine
signaling molecule that is released from cardiomyocytes and suppresses atrial fibrosis. The study showed that
CT overexpression ameliorates AF progression in a novel murine model of spontaneous AF. Moreover, it found
that treating human cultured ACFs with CT inhibited BMP1 cleavage activity and reduced collagen deposition.
BMP1 is a zinc-dependent protease that cleaves and activates several profibrotic substrates, including the TGF-
β large latent complex (LLC) to release secreted TGF-β, a profibrotic signal protein. However, the roles of BMP1
that are regulated by CT have yet to determined. While the previous study suggests that CT treatment
ameliorates AF development in mice, it also found that ACFs from AF patients are resistant to CT treatment
because the CT receptor (CTR) is downregulated as AF progresses. The hypothesis is that a reduction in CT
receptor activation on ACFs leads to enhancement of BMP1 activity, more TGF-β LLC cleavage, and thus more
atrial fibrosis and AF progression. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether BMP1 activity mediates
the regulation of TGF-β by CT in human ACFs, and Aim 2 will determine whether Bmp1 knockout protects against
the development of atrial fibrosis and AF in mice. These studies will provide a more detailed understanding of
the signaling pathway downstream of CT in atrial fibrosis and AF and offer a candidate for a novel gene therapy
approach to reduce atrial fibrosis for the treatment of AF. To accomplish these goals, the proposed training plan
includes learning the relevant research skills such as optical mapping, telemetry ECG recording and analysis,
and histology for analyzing fibrosis. An additional aspect of the training plan involves shadowing cardiologists
throughout the Texas Medical Center as they care for patients with AF and other arrhythmias and practicing
clinical skills during graduate school at the San José Clinic. The research environment is likewise well suited to
the project and training goals and includes dedicated lab spaces for molecular biology studies, mouse
electrophysiology and telemetry recording, mouse surgery, and optical mapping as well as a mentor and
postdoctoral associates who are committed to ensuring the project is successful. In addition to helping to achieve
the proposed research goals, the training plan and environment will also enable career goals of becoming a
physician-scientist and integrating basic science research with patient care to be achieved."
10934353,"The physician-scientist workforce struggles to attract racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in
medicine (URiM), including individuals who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native
Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander. Because the national research agenda is often set by those conducting
scientific studies, increasing the diversity of the physician-scientist workforce has the potential to bring greater
focus on issues that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. Notably, racial and ethnic minority
physician-scientists are more likely to pursue scholarship related to racial/ethnic health inequities.
Prior work has demonstrated that research career intentions evolve significantly during medical school and that
research career intentions at graduation are associated with tangible downstream measures of research
success, including subsequent receipt of NIH funding. Our preliminary data show marked disparities between
URiM and non-URiM students in research career intentions during medical school.
We propose a 5-year, longitudinal, mixed-methods study to identify trajectories (i.e., evolution over time) of
research career intentions, and determinants thereof, in 400 URiM (based on race and ethnicity) students
matriculating into MD programs and to compare these with trajectories and determinants in 200 non-URiM
students. We will examine experiences at the individual level, such as quality of mentorship and experiences of
discrimination, as well as experiences at the institutional level, such as URiM representation in the school's
leadership. The aims are to: 1) identify trajectories of research career intentions among URiM students
throughout medical school training and make comparisons with trajectories in non-URiM students; 2) identify
student- and institutional-level predictors of research career intention trajectories in URiM students and make
comparisons with predictors in non-URiM students; 3) use qualitative methods to characterize nuanced, lived
experiences related to evolution of research career intentions. Quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated
using a convergent approach at the levels of study design, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.
This study is significant because it will identify potentially influential timepoints and predictors of change in
research career intention among URiM MD students that can be used to increase the racial and ethnic diversity
of the physician-scientist workforce. This diversity can help mitigate health disparities by broadening the national
research agenda and increasing research participation by underrepresented populations. Our assessment of the
roles of racism and discrimination in shaping research career intentions is innovative. The impact of our findings
will be enhanced by our strong partnerships with national organizations, including medical education leaders at
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and Association of American Medical
Colleges (AAMC) to disseminate our findings. This study will form the basis of a future proposal to conduct
follow-up of the cohort assembled in this study through residency and into early- and mid-career positions."
10906024,"Project Summary / Abstract:
In preclinical models, norepinephrine released by sympathetic nerves during chronic stress have been
demonstrated to promote an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through activation of the β2-
adrenergic receptor (β2AR) on various cells including immune cells. This sequence of events could be
detrimental to the treatment outcome in cancer patients who are experiencing increased levels of stress. Innate
lymphoid cells (ILCs), specifically type II ILCs (ILC2s), have been demonstrated as a small but critical cell
population within the TME. However, there is little known about the mechanisms that regulate ILC plasticity and
function in the TME. Even though ILC2s express high levels of β2AR, how stress impacts ILC2 activity within the
TME is not yet known. In new preliminary data, we have observed a correlation between increased ILC2s and
decreased tumor volume in knock out mice lacking the β2AR. Furthermore, our data suggests a shift in ILC2
plasticity toward an anti-tumor phenotype upon loss of β2AR signaling by single-cell RNA sequencing. Therefore,
we hypothesize that β2AR signaling activated by chronic stress drives the immunosuppressive function of ILC2s,
suppressing the anti-tumor immune response within the tumor microenvironment. We will interrogate the role
β2AR signaling plays as a rheostat in ILC development and plasticity into the helper ILC subsets by the two aims
proposed here. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of β2AR signaling on common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)
differentiation into ILC2s and ILC2 plasticity. Utilizing in vitro cultures of wildtype and β2AR-/- CLPs and ILC2s
with a β-AR agonist treatment, we will analyze the changes in ILC subset ratios due to β2AR signaling. We will
also elucidate the molecular mechanism by which these changes occur using both targeted and high-throughput
methodologies. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of β2AR signaling on ILC2-mediated tumor progression
using IL-5creβ2-ARfl/fl conditional knockout mice. The changes in the TME and tumor growth in mice with a
conditional β2AR knock out in ILC2 will be analyzed using spectral flow cytometry. Overall, this project will utilize
in vitro and in vivo models and other state-of-the-art techniques to understand how chronic stress through β2-
AR signaling hampers effective ant-tumor immune response in tumor microenvironment."
10876933,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This NIH F30 application describes plan for mentored research and career development
for the PI, Gelare Ghajar-Rahimi. The scientific premise of this proposal is focused on the response of the kidney
endothelial system to acute kidney injury (AKI), a major complication in up to 20% of hospitalized and 60% of
critically ill patients. Despite the high mortality rate and incidence, targeted therapies to treat AKI have not been
successfully developed. Homeostasis of lymphatic and blood endothelial cells is vital to maintaining kidney health
and influences AKI pathogenesis. In response to injury, kidney lymphatic vessels (LV) undergo a process of
expansion termed lymphangiogenesis (LA) that mitigates kidney damage; density of peritubular blood capillaries
decreases, contributes to sustained hypoxia and impairs kidney function. Enhancing LA while simultaneously
impeding peritubular capillary rarefaction therefore holds immense promise as a therapeutic approach. These
two populations have never been studied concurrently in the context of AKI, limiting our ability to develop
endothelia-modulating therapies. Here, I aim to elucidate the cellular origins of de novo LA and the mechanisms
governing the endothelial remodeling following AKI. My preliminary data and existing literature suggest that 1)
de novo LA arises from a progenitor population of pre-existing lymphatic endothelial cells (rather than myeloid-
lineage as some older studies posit) and 2) the divergent responses of blood and lymphatic endothelial
populations to injury may be explained by the influence of NF-kB signaling within injured proximal tubule cells.
My central hypothesis is that that damaged proximal tubules, through NF-kB signaling, promote transcriptional
changes in endothelial cells that contribute to lymphatic expansion and vascular rarefaction. I will test this
hypothesis through advanced microscopy and single cell transcriptomics and a variety of in vitro and in vivo
experiments, including the use of an inducible lymphatic reporter mouse and mice deficient in NF-kB expression
in proximal tubules. These findings will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which
kidney endothelial populations respond to injury and could establish NF-kB as a novel therapeutic target in AKI.
The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by co-mentors Anupam Agarwal, MD, and James George,
PhD. Included in the training plan are experiences that will help Gelare develop in three major areas: 1) rigorous
lymphatic and kidney research, which includes developing familiarity with the existing literature, critical evaluation
of data, and training in the responsible conduct of research; 2) rigorous training in advanced bioinformatics and
next-generation sequencing analysis and 3) career and professional development, including grant and
manuscript writing, scientific communications, and the translation of research findings to clinical applications.
This proposal drives the development of skills required for rigorous scientific research, critical molecular biology
and advanced bioinformatics skills necessary for the PI’s future career as a physician-scientist focused on
cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease."
10748362,"Defects in neuroepithelial progenitor self-renewal and differentiation can result in profound neurodevelopmental
disorders including devastating birth defects such as microcephaly. The long-term objective of the proposed
studies is to understand how neuroepithelial progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation are coordinated. This
proposal specifically focuses on a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is expressed early in mouse
neuroepithelial progenitor cells and, as differentiation proceeds, the lncRNA transcript is processed to yield a
microRNA that is involved in neuronal differentiation. Moreover, the lncRNA physically interacts with key
microcephaly proteins but the functional relationship between the lncRNA and these proteins is unknown. The
major questions addressed in three Aims are as follows. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the lncRNA functions
- independent of the miRNA - in regulating neuroepithelial progenitor proliferation and survival. Aim 1 creates
cell lines and mouse models with specific deletion mutations, including a small deletion of this locus observed in
a patient with microcephaly, for functional studies. Aim 2 will explore the cellular mechanism underlying the
microcephaly phenotype, preliminary data which suggests a mitotic arrest. Moreover, Aim 2 will address the
hypothesis that the lncRNA functions as a scaffold to help maintain sister chromatid cohesion through its
interactions with the Cohesin complex, which is also implicated in microcephaly. Aim 3 will explore the
mechanism underlying the temporal-spatial difference between the lncRNA host transcript and the embedded
miRNA. Our overall goal is to discover new mechanisms that coordinate neuroepithelial progenitor cell
proliferation and differentiation, as well as to decipher how this unexplored lncRNA mechanistically acts to allow
normal brain growth. Harnessing the potential of neuroepithelial progenitor cells holds promise for the treatment
of neuronal injury and neurodegenerative diseases, and dysfunction of neuroepithelial progenitors is at the root
of numerous neurological disorders. Our studies will provide mechanistic links between a novel lncRNA and
known microcephaly proteins to greatly extend our knowledge of this profound brain disorder."
10948078,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Oxytocin is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide primarily produced and secreted from the
paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Widespread expression of the oxytocin receptor
(OXTR) across various brain regions allows oxytocin to mediate a wide range of effects on behavior. Though
classically known for its functions in mediating social and maternal behavior, a growing body of evidence from
both animal models and human studies indicates that the neuropeptide oxytocin is a potent anorexigenic signal
and a promising target for obesity pharmacotherapy development [1-4]. Indeed, intranasal oxytocin for weight
loss is currently under investigation in an active clinical trial [5]. The interest in the oxytocin system as a target
for obesity treatment is based, in part, on findings showing that intranasal oxytocin reduces intake of palatable
foods in humans [6], and that these effects are more potent in participants with obesity [7]. A deeper
understanding of the neural pathways and behavioral processes mediating oxytocin's effects on food intake
and food-motivated behavior is imperative given the clinical potential for this system.
 Oxytocin has been most widely studied for its influence on social behavior. Food intake regulation is
heavily influenced by social factors in both humans and rodents, yet the extent that oxytocin's influence on
these two related fundamental behaviors is interconnected has not been previously investigated. Further,
many of the behaviors modulated by oxytocin show sexual dimorphism, including both social behaviors and
food intake control [8, 9]. Here we focus on the dorsal hippocampus (HPCd) as a candidate brain region where
these functions overlap as HPCd oxytocin signaling facilitates social memory in sexually dimorphic ways [10]
and this region has been recently linked to food intake control [11]. Our preliminary results show that HPCd
oxytocin delivery in male rats reduces intake when isolated in the home cage, yet increases food intake in the
presence of a familiar, but not an unfamiliar conspecific. Aim 1 experiments build off these findings using a
novel social eating paradigm and both pharmacological and virogenetic approaches in males and females to
investigate how HPCd OXTR signaling modulates food intake in social context- and sex-specific ways. Our
additional preliminary data reveal that central oxytocin enhances social transmission of food preference
(STFP) learning in a conspecific familiarity-dependent manner. A recent paper identified a role for the HPCd in
mediating STFP learning through dopamine signaling [12]. Aim 2 experiments will build off these findings to
investigate whether the HPCd is a site of action mediating oxytocin's effects on STFP (Aim 2), and will utilize
pharmacological, neuroanatomical, and in vivo imaging strategy to assess the extent to which oxytocin and
dopamine systems interact to regulate eating in a social context- and sex-dependent manner (Aim 3).
Collectively, these experiments will reveal novel neural, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms mediating
oxytocin's effects on food intake control."
10884212,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like anti-PD-1 have increased overall survival in NSCLC, but most patients still do
not respond to treatment. Cancer vaccines that target tumor-specific antigens, known as neoantigens, may
increase the efficacy of ICIs and other immunotherapies by expanding neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells that
can recognize and destroy tumor cells. Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulatory process
that allows cells to produce different mRNA and protein sequences from the same gene. Alternative splicing is
broadly dysregulated in many cancer types including NSCLC and may generate novel peptide sequences absent
from normal tissue that can be recognized as neoantigens by CD8+ T cells. To identify alternative splicing-
derived neoantigens in NSCLC, we used long-read RNA sequencing to comprehensively map full-length mRNA
isoforms in NSCLC tumors and predict the proteins they encode with high accuracy. We found 145,914 predicted
peptides that were specific to tumors and shared by up to 70% of NSCLC patients. To identify which of these
peptides might be immunogenic, we used immunopeptidomics to directly sequence peptides bound to MHC
Class I in three NSCLC cell lines. We identified 21 peptides that are bound to MHC Class I on NSCLC cells and
are encoded by tumor-specific alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. These splicing-derived peptides are
potentially shared neoantigens that might represent vaccine targets for NSCLC. Therefore, Aim 1 will test
whether any of these 21 splicing-derived peptides can be recognized by CD8+ T cells from NSCLC patients. We
will examine whether patient CD8+ T cells can proliferate, secrete cytokines like interferon-gamma, and lyse
target cells in response to these peptides. The experiments proposed in Aim 1 will provide crucial insight into the
frequency and immunogenicity of alternative splicing-derived neoantigens in NSCLC. Aim 2 will examine which
regulators of alternative splicing are driving production of these peptides. To this end, we will leverage publicly
available databases to identify splicing factors whose expression in tumors or target binding sites suggest an
association with the mRNA isoforms that code for the 21 splicing-derived peptides. We will use targeted genetic
approaches to study whether candidate splicing factors directly regulate peptide-coding isoform splicing in vitro.
This work will highlight mechanisms that can drive the production of tumor-specific splicing-derived peptides and
may reveal novel targets that can be exploited to enhance NSCLC immunogenicity. Altogether, these studies
may identify candidates for new immunotherapies, including personalized NSCLC cancer vaccines that can be
used to treat multiple patients who share expression of immunogenic splicing-derived neoantigens. This proposal
will provide me excellent training that will facilitate my career goals as a physician-scientist who leverages
advances in genomics and immunology to improve care for patients with cancer."

10853011,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is an inflammatory disease of unclear pathogenesis that
remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Immune responses play a central role
in the evolution of this chronic disease, and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibit critical functions
to regulate inflammation. We have shown the level of expression of CD39, an immunosuppressive
ectonucleotidase, on Tregs to be genetically associated in humans with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). Although select SNPs for CD39 have been linked to Crohn disease, no studies have examined whether
alterations in Treg CD39 catalytic activity, and changes in extracellular ATP scavenging with adenosine
generation, impact manifestations of ASCVD. Similarly, a naturally occurring antisense ENTPD1-AS1 has been
shown to decrease CD39 expression in Crohn’s patient Tregs. Inhibition of ENTPD1-AS1 with a specific self-
delivering FANA CD39 antisense (FANA-CD39-AS) oligonucleotide were shown to increase CD39 expression,
providing a therapeutic option to modulate Treg phenotype. Our overall experimental goal is to elucidate the
impact of genetic regulation of Treg CD39 expression in ASCVD. The central hypothesis is that genetic mutations
resulting in decreased Treg CD39 activity and altered purinergic responses drive ASCVD due to the inability to
adequately resolve inflammation. We will test this hypothesis by conducting functional genomic experiments, in
addition to using novel murine experimental model systems, and develop clinical studies, examining isolated
cells and patient biospecimens. The proposal consists of two Aims. In SA1, our investigative team will determine
how Treg expression of CD39 activity impacts atherosclerosis in a validated experimental system. This will be
done using CD39 Treg-specific conditional knock-down and knockout murine models with multiple readouts of
T cell and myeloid activation responses, and adoptive transfer studies, In SA2, we will examine the regulation of
CD39 expression on human Tregs and examine the impact of CD39 modulation on immune function and
inflammation in clinical studies of ASCVD. We have assembled a collaborative team with clinical and
experimental expertise in ASCVD, immunology, vascular biology, genetics, and biostatistics. Completion of the
proposed aims will develop understanding of the role of Tregs, and specifically expression of CD39 and altered
purinergic responses, in ASCVD, this most important and significant disease. Translation to clinical practice will
be facilitated by identification of important biomarkers and novel targets, inclusive of CD39 and related pathways
of adenosinergic signaling, for therapeutic intervention in ASCVD."

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is an idiopathic, non-inflammatory, age-related fibrotic disorder resulting in
compression of the median nerve that affects 10 million Americans annually. Despite the prevalence, cost, and
societal impact of CTS, little progress in its treatment and prevention has been made in the past 50 years,
primarily due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of disease etiology. Aging is a major risk factor not only
for CTS, but also for fibrosis and cellular senescence. Senescent cells exhibit a senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) that is important for wound healing; however, failure to limit this response
appropriately leads to fibrotic disease phenotypes. Our preliminary data shows that markers of cellular
senescence, including senescence associated β-galactosidase, p16Ink4a, p53; immune evasion markers, as well
as SASP factors are increased in both the tissue and cells of the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) of CTS
patients. Further we have found that type II interferon ɣ (IFNɣ) is expressed in the SASP, and that it induces
immune evasion markers. Moreover, targeting senescent pathways in human SSCT cultures using the
senolytics dasatinib + quercetin reduces markers of senescence and fibrosis. Thus, our central hypothesis is
that senescent cell accumulation in the SSCT is causally implicated in pathological aging and fibrosis found in
CTS and that elimination of these senescent cells in the SSCT will attenuate the progression of this
pathological fibrosis and thus alleviate disease progression. Importantly, we have developed a rabbit model of
CTS and progressive SSCT fibrosis that will allow us to study disease mechanisms in vivo. Therefore, to test
this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) elucidate the mechanism by which IFNɣ promotes
senescence and immune evasion in the SSCT, 2) determine the contribution of senescence to fibrosis in CTS,
and 3) evaluate senolytic therapy in vivo. This work will significantly and fundamentally advance our
understanding of SSCT fibrosis in CTS, which is a disease of aging and is associated with multiple age-related
metabolic co-morbidities. Our discovery of increased senescent fibroblast expression of type IFNɣ in fibrotic
tissue and cells could provide a novel therapeutic target for resolution of tissue fibrosis. The innovative aspects
of this project are: it will critically test the heretofore untested hypothesis that senescent cells promote CTS,
address fundamental questions about disease-related senescent cells, test the novel hypothesis that targeting
senescence cells will be a novel therapeutic strategy for CTS and for the first time explore the role of IFNɣ on
CTS pathology. This work aligns well with the “Geroscience Hypothesis” which postulates that interventions
that slow the aging process will simultaneously delay the appearance or severity of many chronic age-related
diseases. CTS is associated with multiple co-morbidities and thus, in addition to advancing the field of aging
and fibrosis biology, novel targeted strategies for CTS treatment and prevention derived from these studies
could rapidly be translated into new, non-surgical therapies for the millions of people who suffer with CTS."
10755602,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We will advance the quantitative understanding of how human muscle structure impacts function, in
health and disease; and we will share the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resources used to
generate this knowledge freely with the muscle research community. At every level of biological
complexity, muscle structure significantly influences muscle function. These properties include the
intermediate-scale relationships known as muscle architecture: the shape and orientation of a muscle’s fibers
with respect to its mechanical line of action. Our understanding of how muscle architecture affects muscle
function remains incomplete, however, and our tools for studying these relationships are insufficiently
developed. As a result, there are critical gaps in our understanding of how pathologically altered muscle
architecture in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) impairs in vivo, whole-muscle function
and exacerbates these muscles’ risk of further injury. To provide this knowledge, we will advance the
technology and application of quantitative MRI techniques such as diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), overcoming
several remaining technical challenges and developing an improved understanding of muscle architecture and
function. Aim 1 is to validate MRI methods for quantifying muscle architecture in a broad range of states of
muscle health and disease, at rest and during contraction. We will validate DTI fiber-tracking algorithms for
quantifying the architecture of healthy, atrophied, inflamed, and fat-infiltrated muscles, and we will develop and
validate methods that combine DTI fiber-tracking and rapidly acquired 3D images to quantify muscle
architecture during contraction. Aim 2 is to advance the quantitative understanding of the functional impact of
muscle architecture in healthy and dystrophic human muscle. We will quantify the relationships among muscle
architecture and force generation, strain development, and the sufficiency of peripheral oxygen supply. The
outcome of this work will be a newly identified physiologic mechanism of injury in DMD and the scientific
foundation for using advanced structural and functional MR imaging to evaluate and guide therapy. Aim 3 is
distribute data and software for MRI-based muscle structure-function analysis. A whole-body imaging dataset
will be made publically available. Also, a software toolkit for processing these data will be made freely available
and supported through collaborations. Overall, we will develop optimal methods for analyzing DTI data from
healthy and diseased muscles and integrating these data with those available from other MRI sequences. We
will create new knowledge about the relationships between muscle structure and function and how they are
impacted by disease. By developing these advances into a freely available dataset and toolkit, we will enable
musculoskeletal researchers worldwide to apply these methods in applied physiology and translational studies."

This K01 SERCA award will provide protected research time and mentoring to Diane Peters, DVM, MS, PhD
as she establishes an independent biomedical research career. Dual-trained as a veterinarian and
pharmacologist, Dr. Peters has a strong background in comparative medicine, animal models of human
disease, in vivo pharmacology, and protease biology. Through completion of the training and research aims
outlined in this proposal, she will expand her knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and build an
advanced technical skill set, to include immunofluorescent imaging, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and
gastrointestinal phenotyping methods, that will form a solid foundation for her planned independent research
program. IBD is a chronic condition that negatively impacts patient quality of life and is associated with a high
public health burden. There is no cure for IBD and a large percentage of affected individuals are unresponsive
to all available treatments. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is zinc metallopeptidase that is highly
overexpressed in the two main subtypes of IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The promise of GCPII
as a therapeutic target in IBD has been demonstrated in multiple independent preclinical studies, which have
shown that small molecule GCPII inhibitors have significant anti-colitis activity in three mechanistically-distinct
mouse models. While it is apparent that GCPII upregulation is relevant in both human and mouse IBD,
knowledge gaps exist regarding its function in disease. This K01 SERCA research will yield critical new data
relevant to the biology of GCPII in IBD. Specifically, in Aim #1 GCPII expression will be defined in normal and
IBD-affected gastrointestinal tissues of human and mouse IBD. In Aim #2, a novel knock-in mouse will be
generated that overexpresses human GCPII in the ileum and colon, followed by longitudinal characterization of
barrier function, gastrointestinal inflammation, microbiome composition and visceral pain response. It is
hypothesized that the localization of GCPII overexpression will be conserved in human and mouse IBD and
that adult mice with forced ileum and colon GCPII overexpression will spontaneously develop colitis.
Successful completion of these research aims will (1) increase our understanding of GCPII dysregulation in
IBD, (2) identify GCPII+ target cell populations with relevance to ongoing to drug development efforts and (3)
yield a novel mouse model of IBD that may have increased similarity to human disease. The proposed
research will be supervised by a multidisciplinary team of expert scientists and clinicians including: Dr.
Barbara Slusher, Director of Johns Hopkins Drug Discovery, Dr. Pankaj Jay Pasricha, Director of the Johns
Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology, Dr. Cynthia Sears, Director of the Johns Hopkins Germ Free
Murine Core, Dr. Robert Anders, Gastrointestinal Pathologist, Dr. Christine McDonald, expert in
Gastrointestinal Barrier Function, and Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck, Gastrointestinal Pathologist and expert in
Mucosal Immunity, who are well-suited to mentor Dr. Diane Peters in her translational IBD research career."

Periodontal disease affects millions of individuals in the US alone and has been substantiated as a precursor
to other debilitating systemic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our laboratories have shown that expression of certain microRNAs
(miRNAs) are elevated in murine polymicrobial periodontitis. The current paradigm is that miRNAs are
generally involved in fine-tuning gene expression. However, our in vitro studies have demonstrated that miR-
146a is a dominant miRNA that can be up-regulated 30 to 200+ fold during lipopolysaccharide stimulation and,
more importantly, that this increase is sustained for days. We have demonstrated that miR-146a is a key
regulator in endotoxin-induced tolerance and cross-tolerance using a monocyte/macrophage-based system.
Similarly, we have demonstrated that miR-132 is a dominant miRNA in peptidoglycan-stimulated monocytes
and can induce cross-tolerance. In the current proposal, these dominant miRNAs will be examined using in
vitro and in vivo systems to critically determine their role in our established murine model of periodontitis with 4
major well-characterized periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella
forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) and Streptococcus gordonii as early colonizer. The overall hypothesis is
that these miRNAs are the dominant miRNAs regulating toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1-signaling pathways. Four
Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will define the mechanistic role of these miRNAs, including
mapping of target mRNAs, in primary human oral epithelial cells in reference to human monocytes. Specific
Aim 2 will determine the expression kinetics of the dominant miRNA in mono- or time-sequential polymicrobial
infection-induced periodontitis in mice and examine the relative effects of TLR2 and TLR4 using gene knockout
mice. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the relative contribution of these dominant miRNAs in this periodontitis model
using specific miRNA knockout mice. Specific Aim 4 will investigate the association of these dominant miRNAs
as biomarkers in gingival crevicular fluid and gingival tissues in chronic periodontitis and correlation with
therapeutic outcomes. The long-term goal is to determine how extensively these dominant miRNAs can serve
as functional biomarkers and they regulate innate immune response pathways contributing to periodontitis. In
future studies, this mouse periodontitis model will become critical to help develop manipulation of these miRNA
functions and/or the TLR pathway into novel therapeutics for periodontitis. Since innate immune response is
known to play critical roles in many other diseases, our findings will likely be applicable to other chronic
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."
10755606,"This proposed Research Career Scientist award is to support the activities of Dr. Courtney Van Houtven,
who is an experienced Department of Veterans Affairs investigator, allowing her to expand her scientific, men-
toring, and service contributions. Dr. Van Houtven leads research studies that test care models to improve the
function and independence of older adults with functional limitations and the function of their informal caregivers.
The overarching goal of her research agenda is to enable at-risk Veterans to remain at home as safely as pos-
sible and for as long as possible. This research is important because there are 9.8 million Veterans over age 65
and 5.5 million Veterans receive informal care in order to remain at home. The majority of Dr. Van Houtven’s
research has been conducted in the VA healthcare system. Dr. Van Houtven used a VA HSR&D funded Career
Development Award to gain mentorship and training to design and test interventions.
 Her 116 published articles are in top-tier health economics, health services research, and geriatrics journals.
A Google Scholar query shows that her work has earned 4,011 citations with an h-index of 28 (8/2020). Dr. Van
Houtven has led or co-led five VA studies, representing over $13 million in VA grant funding, and been co-I
on 13 VA studies. Her research contributions include testing the effectiveness of a skills training program for
caregivers of Veteran patients with functional impairment in an RCT, called HI-FIVES (JGIM 2019). An adapted
version of HI-FIVES called iHI-FIVES has been implemented at 8 VA sites using a stepped wedge cluster ran-
domized RCT as a part of the Optimizing Function and Independence QUERI. The Program Office has requested
that iHI-FIVES be a part of its performance standards to expand services to caregivers. Additionally, Dr. Van
Houtven directs the partnered evaluation of the VA Caregiver Support Program with a team from Durham ADAPT
and the VA National Caregiver Support Program. Over the past six years, she has measured program impacts
and provided feedback to the program office detailing how the program is improving the lives of caregivers and
Veterans and where the program can improve. Besides publishing 10 articles for the evaluation program, she
supported congressional testimony of the SecVA (2017) and filled rapid requests from Program Office leaders.
 In addition to Dr. Van Houtven’s research activities, she is helping build the next generation of VA researchers
through mentoring. Today she mentors 4 VA CDAs (2 as primary, 2 as co-mentor), 1 K-awardee, and has
served on 10 dissertation committees. Her VA service engagement includes contributions to VA Caregiver Sup-
port Program strategic planning, chairing the metrics committee of the Choose Home Initiative, performing grant
reviews for HSR&D/QUERI, and participating in SOTAs and special VA initiatives. Her professional stature can
be assessed by national and international invited talks, such as from the National Academies of Sciences, En-
gineering, and Medicine, National Institutes of Health, and London School of Economics; through impactful pub-
lications (e.g. senior author on HSR&D 2017 article of the year, Thorpe et al); and, activities such as her coedi-
torships, such as at Medical Care Research and Review. In 2019 she co-founded the VA Caregiver Collabora-
tive, comprising of leading VA caregiver researchers. Dr. Van Houtven is recognized internationally as the lead-
ing scholar in economics of informal care research.
 The protected time allowed by a Research Career Scientist award will allow her to expand her contributions
to the VA HSR&D mission, with a focus on improving care for Veterans with functional impairments and the lives
of caregivers. Dr. Van Houtven’s proposed activities for the award period include: 1) leveraging the Function and
Independence Core in the Durham COIN to expand the VA Caregiver Collaborative; 2) advancing methods in
person-centered measurement and advancing methods in economic evaluation of implementation studies; and,
3) recruiting, training and mentoring fellows and early career investigators to build expertise in care models for
functionally impaired Veterans and caregivers, especially focused on health equity."
10755627,"ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the leading cause of death in the US and are costly to
the nation. Despite ongoing prevention efforts, socially and economically disadvantaged populations continue
to bear the highest burden of CVDs. There is growing evidence that social determinants of health can play a
role in producing such disparities in CVD. Yet current interventions designed to reduce disparities in CVD
seldom focus on the social determinants of cardiovascular health across multiple domains and levels of
influence but tend to focus on individual-level factors. Furthermore, when designing interventions, policymakers
have to consider the trade-offs between interventions that maximize health in the general population and those
that minimize health disparities and failure to reach a balance between these can result in increased health
disparities and suboptimal population health. Therefore, to efficiently reduce disparities in CVD—coronary
heart diseases and stroke, there is a pressing need for assisting policy decision-making in the design of
sustainable and affordable targeted health interventions that integrate social factors across domains and levels
of influence and which targets the socially and economically disadvantaged populations. This K01 proposal will
apply several analytic approaches including key informant interviews, the synthetic control method and
simulation modeling and systems science (SMSS) methods to evaluate the impact and costs of intervention
strategies that have the potential to efficiently reduce CVD health disparities. To carry out this proposal, Dr.
Nianogo will (1) identify interventions and policies that are implemented in California which focused on the
social determinants of cardiovascular health across multiple domains and levels of influence, (2) investigate
the impact of three societal policy interventions on CVD incidence; (3) develop a computer simulation model to
project the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of interventions and policies targeting disadvantaged
subpopulations, high-risk subpopulations. Findings from this study help identify targeted health interventions
that have the potential to reduce health disparities in CVD and inform policy decision-making.
 This K01 proposal builds on the candidate’s previous research that developed a computer simulation
model (Virtual Los Angeles Cohort—ViLA) to study the prevalence and incidence of obesity and type 2
diabetes among a representative sample of U.S. persons born in Los Angeles and followed from birth to age
65. The proposal will be pursued within the context of a strong mentorship that has adequate extensive
experience and expertise on intervention research, CVDs, health disparities and simulation modeling that is
necessary for the success of this project. UCLA provides an adequate environment to conduct such innovative
research. Throughout this proposal, the candidate will gain skills in SMSS and CVD disparities research; these
skills are critical to providing Dr. Nianogo with the means and knowledge to become a successful independent
investigator in computational epidemiology and SMSS and to secure future R01 funding."

Naltrexone (NTX) has been proven as an important therapy in helping patients overcome opioid addition and in
preventing overdose. Past usage of NTX has been shown to be both extremely safe and effective. Unfortunately, one
of the major problems with NTX is noncompliance in therapy. To combat this issue, a system must be developed to
deliver NTX for longer durations than currently available with a more patiently friendly format, specifically the duration
of action, injection quantity/volume, and syringe needle size. With the basis of this program supporting the discovery
and development of medications to prevent and treat opioid use disorders and overdose, rapid advancement towards a
viable product for new dose regimens and ease of administration for increased adherence should be one of the first,
scientifically sound, and robust choices moving forward.
PLGA-based drug delivery systems have been used successfully in a number of small molecule products and are the
most widely utilized and studied biocompatible polymer systems in controlled release. Therefore, the regulatory and
development hurdles with the FDA will be `lower' than with other novel excipients or technologies. The goal of this
research and product development plan is to submit a phase I application for a 2-month NTX formulation with favorable
release kinetics and a patient-friendly format. Our preliminary data indicate two types of current, laboratory based
systems can provide both a high drug loading and controllable release kinetics resulting of NTX for at least 2 months.
The Specific Aim of this project is to optimize and bridge our laboratory scale 2-month injectable NTX delivery
formulation to phase 1 clinical trials using 380 mg of NTX with a microparticle size of less than 100 µm for a less
painful injection The Sub-Aims for the UG3 phase are: (i) Establish the design space for the two 2-month NTX (2M-
NTX) formulations: Early Release (ER) and Delayed Release (DR); (ii) In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluations of 2M-
NTX-ER and 2M-NTX-DR formulations; and for the UH3 phase (iii) GMP manufacturing scale-up of the lead candidate
formulation; (iv) Lead candidate formulation nonclinical characterization; and (v) 505b2 IND submission for a phase I
clinical trial. The innovation in this technology is the ability to control the NTX release kinetics while eliminating the
initial burst; based on our mechanistic understanding of the PLGA microparticle formation process, using PLGAs with
specific molecular properties, and providing tight control over the manufacturing conditions. This innovation has
allowed us to design two specific types of formulations to aid in combating the opioid epidemic: (1) ER providing near
zero-order release kinetics for two months and (2) DR providing an initial lag phase of 7-10 days, where minimal NTX
release occurs, so it can be administered to patients who are still under the influence of opioids without precipitating
withdrawal symptoms. PLGA-based microparticle formulations have previously been scaled and have been shown to
be safe based on the approximate 20 FDA approved products currently on the market. The significance of this research
and product development is the final outcome of this project will ultimately provide a new, readily viable, essential tool
to help patients overcome opioid dependence."
10756973,"Project Summary
Affective disorders are highly prevalent in women and associated with significant morbidity and
mortality, particularly during times of reproductive transition, including the transition to
menopause. Unraveling the pathophysiology of affective disorders is challenging because
depressive syndromes are heterogeneous and have diverse etiologies. Thus, studies aimed at
identifying biomarkers to improve the prediction of susceptibility and illness course as well as
treatment response in affective disorders have yielded inconsistent results. We propose to
address this challenge by studying symptoms that initially present during the menopause
transition and thus have a common endocrine trigger. We believe that studying a relatively
homogeneous group of participants with similar biological mechanisms of symptom onset will
increase the likelihood of elucidating the pathogenesis of perimenopausal-onset symptoms. This
proposal will use simultaneous positron emission tomography and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (PET-MR) to examine relations between reward-related striatal activation
measured by fMRI and tonic and phasic striatal DA activity measured by [11C]raclopride PET in
a transdiagnostic sample of women with varying severities of perimenopausal-onset (PO)
anhedonia and psychosis. Specific Aim 1 will examine associations between PO anhedonia and
psychosis symptom severity and reward-related striatal activation measured by fMRI and tonic
and phasic striatal DA activity measured by [11C]raclopride PET. Specific Aim 2 will examine
relations between anhedonia reductions due to estradiol administration, relative to placebo, and
changes in PET-MR metrics related to reward processing. Specific Aim 3 will examine relations
between PO psychosis reductions due to estradiol, relative to placebo, and changes in PET-MR
metrics related to reward processing. Our central hypotheses are that the mesolimbic dopamine
system is impaired during reward processing in PO anhedonia and psychosis, that the effects of
estradiol administration will be associated with normalization of neural responses to rewards
measured by fMRI and striatal dopamine functioning measured by PET, and that the degree of
change in striatal functioning measured by fMRI and PET will be associated with the magnitude
of change in PO anhedonia and psychosis symptom severity. The results of this project will
increase our understanding of anhedonia and psychosis vulnerability during the menopause
transition and have the potential to deliver validated molecular imaging targets to use in future
mechanistic clinical trials of novel treatments for perimenopausal-onset psychiatric disorders."

Generating an appropriate antibody response is critical for protection against reinfection and for the effectiveness
of vaccination, particularly in the context of viral diseases. In addition to well-studied quantitative parameters
such as antibody titer and affinity, other, more qualitative parameters related to the clonal composition of the
response also play critical roles in antibody-mediated protection. These include antigen and epitope specificity,
which is key to viral neutralization capacity and antibody breadth, and overall clonal diversity, which strongly
influences the degree of immunodominance and therefore the ability of viruses to escape immunity by mutation.
Despite their importance, such “ecological” aspects of GC biology remain poorly understood and systematically
understudied at the mechanistic level.
Our long-term goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how the competitive waxing and waning of B
cell clones at the various stages of the immune response shapes the ultimate composition, specificity, and
protective efficacy of serum antibody. In our previous studies, using multicolor “Brainbow”-based B cell fate-
mapping models, we focused on the germinal center (GC) and memory phases of the response, revealing how
highly diverse early responders are funneled towards oligoclonality, first progressively by GC selection (including
in chronic gut-associated GC) and then dramatically by secondary boosting. We now propose to extend our work
using these same tools to investigate the clonal dynamics of prolonged selection in long-lived virus-induced GCs
(Aim 1) and of the progressive differentiation of plasmablasts and plasma cells from GC precursors (Aim 2). We
also propose a new “molecular fate-mapping” system to determine how clonal dynamics impact the ultimate
composition of serum antibody (Aim 3). This allows us to investigate the B cell biology of serum-level phenomena
such as antigenic imprinting/original antigenic sin, immunodominance, and viral escape.
We expect our findings will provide greater mechanistic understanding of how the composition and protective
effectiveness of serum antibody is determined by the dynamics of B cell clonal competition, with implications for
the design of effective vaccination strategies for influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2."

The hippocampus is important for learning and memory and is highly susceptible to aggregation of microtubule-
associated protein tau (MAPT) and neurodegeneration. Hippocampal and neocortical atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) brains demonstrates degeneration predominantly in large glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in association cortices
while inhibitory interneurons and primary cortices are resistant to MAPT accumulation and degeneration. However, the
molecular mechanisms that cause damage and death of susceptible neurons are not understood. Developing a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing vulnerability of excitatory neurons to damage and identifying
pathways that regulate tau-mediated neurodegeneration will be essential to unraveling the pathogenesis and
progression of AD and identifying potential therapeutic targets. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify pathways
that make excitatory neurons susceptible to tau accumulation and neurodegeneration, and identify potential therapeutic
targets for AD. One important limitation is the cellular heterogeneity of the mammalian brain. To overcome the cellular
heterogeneity, this proposal will innovatively use single cell RNA sequencing in fresh AD human brain tissue and viral
translating ribosome affinity purification (vTRAP) in a mouse model of tauopathy to generate transcriptional profiles of
excitatory and inhibitory neurons from vulnerable and resilient regions of the brain in the context of aging and
neurodegeneration. Global gene co-expression networks for excitatory and inhibitory neurons will be constructed
through Weighted Interaction Network Analysis (WINA) and Multiscale Embedded Gene co-Expression Network
Analysis (MEGENA). WINA and MEGENA derived modules will then be associated with AD and the top key drivers of
the modules most associated with AD will become the candidate targets for experimental validation. We will also identify
distinct and intersecting pathways from glutamate and tau mediated toxicities specifically in the pyramidal neurons of
CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Bacterial artificial chromosome TRAP (BAC-TRAP) reporter mouse lines in
conjunction with models of glutamate dyshomeostasis (EAAT2-/-) and mutant human tau (P301S) will be used to
generate translational profiles of CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus at various stages of disease progression.
Further, we will also evaluate the role of EAAT2, the major glutamate transporter, in tau accumulation, trans synaptic
tau spread, immune dysfunction and neurodegeneration, and its potential as a therapeutic target using genetic (viral
vector) and chemical (riluzole) approaches. This proposal will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of
excitatory neuronal susceptibility and resilience of inhibitory neurons in AD, identify potential new therapeutic targets for
tau-mediated neurodegeneration and provide a mechanistic understanding of glutamate transporter EAAT2 as a
mediator of inflammation and spread of tau pathology. A better understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms of AD is crucial for the development of novel and more effective therapeutic targets. This proposal
has the potential to make a significant impact to the field of AD by uncovering novel mechanisms of disease and
identification of specific therapeutic targets."
10764211,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In the United States, alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~15% of adults with the prevalence of binge drinking
on the rise in adolescents and young adults. AUD represents a major issue to healthcare given that chronic
excessive alcohol consumption in humans is associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and
cancer while acute alcohol intoxication can prove lethal. Economically, AUD represents a massive burden due
to loss of productivity and associated healthcare costs. Recently, the endocrine hormone fibroblast growth
factor 21 (FGF21), known for its potent metabolic effects, was found to significantly reduce alcohol
consumption via signaling through its obligate co-receptor, β-klotho, in the brain. Importantly, single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in both the FGF21 and β-klotho genomic loci are highly associated with increased
alcohol consumption in humans. Our preliminary data demonstrates that FGF21 treatment markedly
suppresses alcohol consumption in mice previous subjected to chronic alcohol exposure. Furthermore,
excessive alcohol consumption promotes FGF21 secretion from the liver representing a homeostatic feedback
loop to regulate alcohol consumption. However, the mechanism of FGF21 action in the brain and the neuronal
target(s) for these effects has not been determined. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the neural
circuit(s) regulating FGF21-mediated suppression of alcohol intake. The aims of this grant are to 1) determine
the direct neuronal target(s) of FGF21 in the CNS mediating inhibition of alcohol intake, and 2) determine how
FGF21 modulates reward circuits to regulate alcohol intake and preference. To accomplish these aims, we
have generated novel animal models and tools to examine these experimental aims. These studies will provide
new fundamental insights into the regulation of alcohol intake by peripheral endocrine signals acting on the
central nervous system. In addition, these studies may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of
AUD."

Recent development of transcriptome-wide approaches to detect modified nucleotides has revealed an
expanding repertoire of modified nucleotides in messenger RNA. RNA modifications represent a new layer of
eukaryotic gene regulation. Pseudouridine (Ψ) is a modified nucleotide that is prevalent in human mRNAs and
can be dynamically regulated in different conditions. However, the endogenous functions of Ψ in mRNA are not
currently understood. We have shown that nascent pre-mRNA is pseudouridylated co-transcriptionally at
thousands of locations by multiple Pseudouridine Synthases (PUSs). We found that pre-mRNA Ψs are
enriched in regions important for splicing regulation and overlap splicing factor binding sites. Genetic
manipulation of Ψ synthases leads to widespread alternative splicing and individual Ψ directly affect splicing in
vitro. PUSs have been linked to a wide range of diseases, including cancer. High expression of pre-mRNA Ψ
synthases correlates with decreased survival in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) and rewiring of gene
expression by alternative splicing is important for HCC pathology. NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence
Award seeks to define PUS-dependent alternative splicing networks in HCC cells (Aim 1), identify molecular
mechanisms by which Ψs regulates pre-mRNA splicing (Aim 2) and investigate mechanisms by which Ψ is
deposited in pre-mRNA co-transcriptionally (Aim 3). During the mentored phase of this award Dr. Martinez will
identify PUS-dependent alternative splicing in HepG2 cells by sequencing based methods for Ψ detection and
alternative splicing analysis.
splicing
Dr. Martinez will determine the effect of Ψ on the binding of candidate Ψ-sensitive
factors, whose binding sites are enriched for overlapping Ψ locations, using biochemical approaches.
During the independent phase, Dr. Martinez will define the HCC specific pre-mRNA Ψ landscape and identify
PUS-dependent HCC specific alternative splicing events by profiling Ψ, and corresponding splicing changes in
primary normal and HCC cells. Her elucidation of mechanisms of Ψ-mediated splicing regulation in HCC cells
will uncover potential disease related modes of splicing regulation. During
the
K99
and
R00
portion
of
the
award
Dr.
Martinez
will
determine
how Ψ synthases are recruited to nascent pre-mRNA by investigating
mechanisms of recruitment to chromatin and association with Pol II by a combination of chromatin- and co-
immunoprecipitation experiments and measuring extent of pseudouridylation in relation to transcription
dynamics using a novel sequencing approach. The pathology of disease-linked Ψ synthases may be due to
dysregulation of their pre-mRNA targets. Therefore, defining and characterizing the effect of PUS-dependent
pre-mRNA Ψs in pre-mRNA processing will help explain how these enzymes contribute to disease. The
Pathway to Independence Award will allow Dr. Martinez to gain the necessary expertise (e.g. technology
development and computational approaches to discover RNA modifications, techniques to study transcriptional
coupling) and professional skills (e.g. mentoring and management) to become a competitive candidate for an
academic position at a major research university."
10764215,"Organ transplantation remains the definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage organ
failure. Maintenance of functional allografts requires organ recipients to stay on immune-
suppressive drugs. However, most allografts have a limited lifespan because of the chronic
rejection initiated by the host alloimmune responses. The majority of immunosuppressive
treatments are targeted to the effector immune cells, such as T cells, leaving the root of
alloimmune responses—alloantigen presentation—untouched and leading to an immune
equilibrium which eventually is shifted toward graft rejection. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) with user-
defined specificity could be harnessed to induce immune suppression at desired tissues. They
also preserve the ability to tolerize antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through contact-dependent
cellular crosstalk. Our vision is to develop a robust allospecific immune regulatory strategy that
restricts alloimmune T cell responses at both the effector site (allograft) and the alloantigen
presentation site(graft draining lymphoid tissue) to shift the immune equilibrium to long-term
suppression in the allograft while keeping the remainder of the host immune system fully
operational. By leveraging the ability of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to recognize any desired
target and a lymph node targeting molecular vaccine to specifically deliver the target to lymph
node APCs, we will engineer an orthogonal synthetic vaccine to bridge crosstalk between CAR
Tregs and APCs via the CAR-directed interaction with its cognate bio-inert ligand synthetically
displayed on APCs. This synthetic vaccine-mediated crosstalk will have two outcomes: 1) APC-
to-CAR Treg signaling promotes CAR Treg expansion and migration to the allograft for targeted
suppression with enhanced regulatory functions. 2) CAR Treg-to-APC signaling tolerizes APC to
restrict alloreactive T cell priming and to promote the generation of induced regulatory T cells
(iTregs), which enforces a self-sustaining immunosuppression cycle via “infectious tolerance”. We
will evaluate the synthetic crosstalk in murine allotransplantation models. If successful, this
platform technology could be implemented across a broad landscape for precision control of
pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, graft-versus-host disease, and
transplant rejection."
10764319,"Project Summary
Benzodiazepines (BZs) are effective and safe when used appropriately, but their utility is limited by unwanted
side effects like misuse and reduced safety when combined with other drugs. Individuals with substance-use
disorders (SUDs) misuse BZs as much as 20x greater than the general population, and the rising number of
overdose deaths attributed to BZs are largely driven by opioid co-administration. Given the high rates of polydrug
use among individuals who also misuse BZs, preclinical evaluations of BZs should consider the polydrug
scenarios in which they are being misused. The goal of this research is to identify pharmacological determinants
of BZ misuse, with the goal of identifying BZ-type ligands with reduced abuse potential in polydrug situations.
We reported previously that nonselective, partial-efficacy BZ ligands or those that lack intrinsic efficacy at a1-
subunit containing GABAA (a1GABAA) receptors have reduced abuse potential relative to traditional BZs.
However, our data suggest that the degree to which these BZ-type ligands exhibit abuse potential depends on
the subject’s drug history. This new application will use choice models to evaluate the overall hypothesis that
drug experience is a key determinant of the role of GABAA receptor subtypes in the abuse potential of BZ-type
ligands. A key finding from our choice research is that efficacy at a1GABAA receptors may be necessary for self-
administration of BZs in cocaine-experienced subjects, but not required for enhancement of cocaine choice. It is
unknown whether this pattern of effects is observed with other drugs of abuse, in particular opioids. Moreover,
the pharmacological mechanism underlying these effects is unknown, with possibilities including (1) a differential
role for a1GABAA receptors in reinforcement-enhancing vs. reinforcing effects of BZs alone, or (2) differences in
overall intrinsic efficacy, irrespective of subtype selectivity. We will address these potential mechanisms in two
Aims organized by unique approaches. In Aim 1, we will use drug vs. drug choice to evaluate the extent to which
BZ-type ligands varying in efficacy and selectivity will enhance or attenuate drug choice when delivered as a
combination with cocaine, heroin, or alprazolam in separate groups of subjects. In Aim 2, we will use drug vs.
nondrug choice to evaluate the hypothesis that nonselective, partial modulators or a1-sparing BZs will have
reduced reinforcing effects when delivered alone in subjects with a history of cocaine, heroin, alprazolam, or
food choice. A significant addition to our groups of monkeys with different reinforcement histories will be the
food-experienced animals, providing a quantitative model of drug-naïve individuals’ initial exposure to drug
taking. BZ use among individuals with a SUD, in or out of treatment, is increasingly common and is associated
with increased risk of BZ misuse and overdose. Testing the hypotheses proposed will provide critical information
for understanding how past and current drug use affects the abuse liability of BZ-type drugs."
10764224,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL COMPONENT
 This application is a competing renewal of the “Squirrel Monkey Breeding and Research Resource”
(SMBRR) P40 OD010938 which has received continuous NIH grant support since 1980. The SMBRR is the
only national research resource of squirrel monkeys available to NIH grantees, intramural research programs
of federal agencies including the FDA, NSF, and the NIH, and other sponsors of biomedical research (private
foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations). Because Bolivian squirrel
monkeys are no longer available from source countries, and there are no other breeding colonies of pedigreed
squirrel monkeys available for biomedical research, the SMBRR is a unique research resource that cannot
be duplicated or replaced. The scarcity of squirrel monkeys, difficulties associated with captive breeding, as
well as the challenges associated with their care and use in research, all contribute to the need for this national
research resource. The SMBRR has integrated multiple disciplines into a program designed to meet the needs
of investigators who utilize its resources. In the upcoming years, the SMBRR will continue to improve the
resources it provides and continue to add new information about the biology and research value of squirrel
monkeys. Squirrel monkeys continue to be an important animal model in neuroscience research, drug
addiction research, malaria vaccine research, and fundamental evolutionary biology. Over the next five years,
the SMBRR will focus on refining the animals and related resources to meet the needs of the scientific
community. The aims of the Resource Core Component address our continued commitment to meeting the
needs of the research community for access to squirrel monkeys and information about using squirrel monkeys
in research. We will explore the causes of perinatal mortality in a retrospective epidemiology study. We will
produce a long read genome sequence from a Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis and extend our BioBank to
include specific DNA sources from the resource. The Applied Component research projects focus on basic
research projects that will enhance biomedical models using squirrel monkeys. These studies include defining
and characterizing the different classes of monocytes in squirrel monkeys, as well as characterizing the gut
microbiome in differing age classifications of animals. We will also begin to test memory in our adult and
geriatric squirrel monkey populations using computer assisted learning methods. The overall goals of the
SMBRR are to provide a national research resource of squirrel monkeys; provide squirrel monkey
derived biological materials; provide education and training opportunities to scientists wishing to work
with squirrel monkeys, colony managers, and animal caregivers; and provide investigators with
facilities and expertise to conduct studies using squirrel monkeys."
10764707,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Paget’s Disease (PD) is usually diagnosed in patients >50 years of age, and is characterized by focal bone
lesions (PDLs) that progress from an initial lytic to a mixed osteolytic-osteoblastic phase, due to rapid new bone
formation. PD patients rarely develop new PDLs beyond those present at diagnosis. The primary cellular
abnormality in PD resides in the osteoclast (OCL). However, the mechanisms responsible for the highly focal
nature of PDLs, why PD is diagnosed in elderly patients, especially in patients harboring genetic mutations
linked to PD, and the mechanisms driving the exuberant resorption/formation in PD, are unclear. We showed
that OCLs from 70% of PD patients express measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP), and transgenic mice
with MVNP targeted to OCLs (MVNP mice) develop PDLs and the abnormal OCLs characteristic of PD. MVNP-
expressing OCLs and OCLs from PD patients are hyper-responsive to RANKL and express high IL-6 levels,
which induce high levels of IGF1 in OCLs (OCL-IGF1) to promote osteoblast (OB) differentiation in MVNP mice.
Importantly, OCLs from PD patients but not normal donors also express increased IL-6 and IGF1. We confirmed
OCL-IGF1’s role in PD and normal bone remodeling in vivo by generating WT and MVNP mice with targeted
deletion of Igf1 in OCLs. We found that MVNP mice but not MVNP mice lacking OCL-Igf1 developed PDLs.
Thus, high OCL-IGF1 levels in PD may be required to induce PDLs. However, these results do not explain why
PDLs occur in aging patients or animal models and persist locally for long periods. These observations are
most readily explained by stochastic changes in a long-lived bone cell population, most likely osteocytes
(OCys). In this proposal we will test the Hypothesis: that pagetic OCL precursors, which are hyper-responsive
to RANKL, home to specific skeletal sites containing senescent, pre-lesional OCys that produce or induce
locally increased RANKL. As PD-OCLs numbers increase, they hyper-secrete sufficient IL-6 and IGF-1 to
decrease Sost/sclerostin, increase expression of Wnts, block OCy differentiation and act directly on OB to
enhance new bone formation. In preliminary studies, we found that OCys in PD (PD-OCys) express lower
levels of OCy maturation markers, and display markedly reduced dendritic processes. Further, the percentage
of sclerostin+ OCys adjacent to PDLs in MVNP mice was significantly lower compared to MVNP mice without
PDLs or WT mice, and that IGF1 suppressed sclerostin expression in OCys. Importantly, similar morphologic
changes occurred in OCys in bone samples of a PD patient, but not a normal donor. These results suggest
that OCys may be key contributors to the pathogenesis of PD. To further test this hypothesis, we will: Aim 1.
Characterize OCL-IGF1’s effects in PD and PD-OCys, identify the molecular mechanisms involved, and test if
increased OCL-IGF1 is sufficient to induce PDLs and PD-OCys. Aim 2. Determine the role of senescent OCys
in the location, development, progression and persistence of PDLs and PD. We will assess if prolonged
exposure of PD-OCLs to normal OCys, or shorter exposure to OCys in older mice suffices for PDLs to develop."

Lung inflammation is one of the profound contributors to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The
initial acute lung inflammation in response to infection or tissue injury leads to profound infiltration of leukocytes
and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Myeloid cells, including macrophages, are key players mediating
the onset and resolution of acute lung inflammation. However, the triggers that reprogram macrophages to
control excessive inflammation remain incompletely understood. Recent work has demonstrated a key role for
microRNAs (miRNAs) in inflammatory diseases. However, little research has been done to assess the
functional role of miRNAs in macrophages in the context of controlling lung inflammation. We hypothesize that
control of lung inflammation involves the transcriptional induction of specific miRNAs in macrophages. Our
study has identified microRNA-147 (miR-147) to be dramatically increased in recruited macrophages during
lung inflammation. The induction of miR-147 is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1A. Functionally, miR-
147 controls macrophage inflammation in vitro, and myeloid-derived miR-147 dampens lung
inflammation in vivo. We identified and confirmed the mitochondria complex associated protein
NDUFA4 as a leading miR-147 target. New and exciting preliminary data indicated that by targeting
NDUFA4, miR-147 dampens the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα in
macrophages. Additional evidence supports that inhibition of succinate oxidation and concomitant
histone hypermethylation contributes to the miR-147/NDUFA4 mediated effect. Finally, overexpression of
miR-147 improves the recovery from lung inflammation in vivo. Here, we test the hypothesis that the miR-
147/NDUFA4 axis represents an endogenous protective pathway in macrophages to control lung inflammation.
The following three aims have been proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will use state-of-art miR-
147 reporter mice to study the transcriptional regulation of miR-147 and investigate how miR-
147/NDUFA4 axis controls macrophage inflammation in vitro. In Aim 2, we will perform proof-of-principle
studies in human ARDS and employ cutting-edge transgenic mice to investigate the functional role of
miR-147/NDUFA4 axis in macrophages during lung inflammation in vivo. In Aim 3, we will further explore
the therapeutic targeting of miR-147/NDUFA4 axis in modulating lung inflammation. The completion of the
proposed study will identify miRNA targets as an innovative therapeutic approach for ARDS."
10764709,"Abstract: Segmental long bone defect surgeries require large devitalized allograft
transplantations to replace missing host bone segments; however, significant problems often
arise due to the impaired ability of the devitalized allograft to incorporate into the host bone.
Recently, several discoveries in our lab have provided the basis for selecting, expanding and
delivering of a substantial number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which retain their original
stem cell characteristics, to be utilized in skeletal therapeutic applications: i) Notch2-selected and
Notch activation by recombinant Jagged1 (JAG1) ligand expanded MSCs possess enhanced
potentials for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation; ii) MSC sheets generated in
temperature-responsive culture dishes exhibit a more robust effect on allograft incorporation into
the host bone when transplanted to the site of the defect as a tissue-engineered periosteum
surrounding the implanted graft; iii) Notch signaling induces rapid TWIST1 expression in MSCs.
Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that cell sheets generated with JAG1 expanded
Notch2 positive MSCs on thermo-responsive culture dishes will significantly enhance critical
segmented bone defects healing in a femoral allograft repair mouse model. To test this hypothesis,
we will first to determine whether Notch2-selected and JAG1 expanded MSC sheets significantly
enhance allograft healing and incorporation using our pre-clinical femoral allograft mouse model,
as compared to cell sheets derived from traditionally isolated and expanded MSCs. Second, we
will examine whether TWIST1 is require for JAG1-mediated MSC proliferation and maintenance
in culture. Finally, we will determine how Notch activation by JAG1 involved in MSC sheet-
induced angiogenesis. Data generated by this proposal will likely 1) identify optimized cell
populations for generating tissue engineered periosteum (next generation MSC sheets), 2)
validate a novel therapeutic approach for enhancing the repair of massive devitalized bone
allograft and lead to advances in understanding the mechanism underlying MSC sheet-induced
tissue repair, and 3) pave the path for large pre-clinical animal studies and subsequent clinical
trials."

Sepsis affects millions of Americans annually and is a leading cause for intensive care utilization. Currently no
therapies exist to target the abnormal host response that is widely acknowledged to contribute to multi-organ
dysfunction and death from severe infection. The applicant has received continuous R01 support from the
NHLBI since 2007-2008 to research the host vascular response in sepsis. Our group has identified the Tie2
receptor and its ligands, the Angiopoietins, as an important switch in the endothelium that may govern
essential elements of the vascular response to sepsis. We have proposed that Angiopoietin-2, an antagonist
of Tie2 that is induced during sepsis, potentiates vascular leakage and thereby contributes to acute respiratory
distress arising from sepsis and related conditions. Since Angiopoietin-2 can be measured peripherally, we
have also proposed that its circulating concentration may predict the risk of adverse outcomes from sepsis and
may enable clinicians to track the host vascular response in a quantitative and operator-independent fashion.
Finally, we have recently found evidence that polymorphisms at the TIE2 locus itself may inform the level of
gene expression, and in turn, how well or poorly an individual's blood vessels respond to the stress of sepsis.
This body of work to which we and many others have now contributed suggests that we are on the cusp of
developing breakthrough personalized medicine approaches based on the host vascular response in sepsis.
Such advances could revolutionize the care delivered in our ICUs.
This application seeks to develop the core hypothesis that the Tie2 axis may be a crucial determinant of the
host vascular response in sepsis through the following three themes: (1) create humanized mouse models of
the Tie2 axis using cutting-edge genome engineering to model the human host vascular response, and its
genetic determinants, in a physiological context; (2) identify major mechanisms by which Tie2 and the
endothelium regulate hemostasis in sepsis; and (3) study the crosstalk between the microcirculation and
metabolically active organs to understand how the host vascular response and dysmetabolism collaborate to
drive multi-organ dysfunction.
The outstanding qualifications of our team in the Tie2 field, genetic epidemiology, thrombosis research, and
metabolism uniquely position us to deliver an unprecedented and integrated molecular view of sepsis from the
perspective of blood vessels that is not only highly responsive to the challenges in sepsis research identified by
global leaders, but could fundamentally alter paradigms of patient care in the ICU."

The intestinal pathogen Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and is responsible for
more than 250 million cases of dysentery annually, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths. The disease results
from epithelial cell infection in the colon, leading to mucosal ulceration, vascular lesions and massive immune
cell infiltration. Various animal models have been used to model various aspects of the disease, but none of
these models recapitulated the colonic symptoms of human shigellosis. We have recently shown that infant
rabbits experience all the symptoms of human shigellosis, including epithelial fenestration in the colon,
vascular lesions, immune cell infiltration, and bloody diarrhea. Here, we propose to use the infant rabbit model
of shigellosis to investigate the role of host factors in the disease and clarify aspects that are controversial in
the field. In Aim1, we will determine the route of intestinal cell infection in the colon. The prevalent view is that
S. flexneri invades the epithelium via M cells, a notion that was derived from studies conducted in the small
intestine of adult rabbits. Our preliminary data however suggest that in the colon, S. flexneri directly invade
epithelial cells. In Aim2, we will clarify the exact role of neutrophils in shigellosis. We will determine if they are
the cause of extensive damage inflicted to the colonic tissue, as previously suggested, or if they are indeed
beneficial and required for confining the infection process to the mucosa. In Aim3, we will determine the
mechanisms supporting S. flexneri interaction with macrophages and dendritic cells, and their role in regulating
the resolution of shigellosis."

Cytochromes P450 (CYP) form one of the largest enzyme superfamilies on Earth and can be divided
into two groups based on their substrate preferences: those metabolizing a vast array of xenobiotic
molecules (e.g., drugs and pollutants) and those with very strict requirements towards their
physiological substrates (e.g., steroids and vitamins). Sterol 14α-demethylases (CYP51) represent a
very special P450 family, which is currently regarded as the evolutionary progenitor for all existing
P450s. CYP51 enzymes are found in all kingdoms of life. With sequence identities across phyla as low
as 22-25%, they catalyze the same three-step regio- and stereo-specific reaction that involves two
successive hydroxylations followed by the C-C bond cleavage. The CYP51 reaction is an essential step
in the biosynthesis of sterols and serves as the major drug target for the treatment of fungal infections
in humans and plants. We have validated CYP51 druggability across phylogeny, including protozoa
(trypanosomes, leishmania, amoebas) and human. We determined 35 CYP51 X-ray structures and
successfully applied structure-based drug design to build an in-house chemical library of novel
pathogen-selective inhibitors, which are non-toxic and have favorable pharmacokinetics. Our work has
revealed the conserved molecular basis for CYP51 catalysis, species-specific variations substrate
preferences and sensitivity to inhibition, and has enabled identification of CYP51 orthologs in >1000
bacterial organisms, justifying prokaryotic ancestry of the enzyme. We have also discovered that, as
part of conservation from bacteria to human, CYP51 catalysis involves large-scale conformational
rearrangements in the P450 molecule. The goals of our research under MIRA support will be to
combine the strength of different techniques of biochemistry, molecular and structural biology
(crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, computational approaches) in order to understand how
conformational dynamics governs CYP51 throughout the catalytic cycle, mediates allosteric regulation,
specificity in molecular recognition and intermolecular assemblies of multi-component electron transfer
systems. We will gain new mechanistic insights into CYP51 enzyme function and inhibition, as well as
uncover the structural basis for its possible role in P450 diversification. The current set of proteins
available for comparative analysis comprise CYP51s form endoplasmic reticulum of higher and lower
eukaryotes (vertebrates, fungi, and protozoa), their endogenous electron donor partners cytochrome
P450 reductases, and the natural CYP51-ferredoxin fusion protein from the cytoplasm of a sterol-
making bacterium. Enzymes from plants that contain multiple CYP51 genes will be added as the
research program progresses."
10756925,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Secondary bacterial infection following influenza (super-infection) can lead to cytokine storm (an overexuberant
immune response) that often leads to pneumonia and death in patients. Our work focuses on the molecular
mechanisms by which the immune system returns to homeostasis after microbial infections. Taking a holistic,
systems approach, we investigated the inflammatory responses during a single (influenza or Staphylococcus
aureus) and super-infection (influenza/S. aureus). We conducted transcriptional and lipidomic analyses in
samples from a mouse super-infection model. Our lipidomic analysis was focused on eicosanoids because they
play critical roles in inducing and resolving inflammation. When compared to single infections, we discovered an
overproduction of a subset of eicosanoids during super-infection. These lipids (anti-inflammatory CYP450 lipid
mediators, primarily DHET) can activate the nuclear receptors and transcription factors PPARa and PPARg.
During influenza single infection, moderate induction of CYP lipids (primarily EET) during the resolution phase
allows for appropriate anti-inflammatory responses to promote the return to homeostasis. We hypothesize that
while EET promotes the physiological resolution of inflammation after microbial infections, DHET produced at
an aberrant level during super-infection leads to the alteration in macrophage polarization and inhibition of
bacterial clearance. The failure to control the bacterial pathogen amplifies the immune signals to recruit additional
immune cells which eventually cause irreversible tissue damage. We will take the following approaches during
single and super-infection to investigate the effects of the eicosanoid-PPAR axis on the inflammatory response.
First, we will determine the effects of perturbing the eicosanoid-PPAR axis on the resolution or amplification of
inflammation during single and super-infection. We will use chemical inhibitors in combination with genetic
models to determine whether the animals will be protected from or succumb to disease during single and super-
infection. We will determine the lipidomic profiles to assess the specific effects of the inhibitors have on the
eicosanoid metabolism networks. We will also determine the bacterial/viral loads, cellularity, pathohistology, and
targeted transcriptional profiling of macrophages. Second, we will determine the mechanism by which
eicosanoid-activated PPARα/γ modulates immune signaling, macrophage polarization and immune metabolism
in vitro. Macrophage polarization (classically or alternative activated) can amplify or resolve inflammatory
responses. We will determine the potency of different CYP450 metabolites to activate PPARα/γ within mouse
and primary human macrophages. We will determine how eicosanoids (CYP450 metabolites) affect the immune
signaling, macrophage polarization, and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, While the induction of inflammation has
been the subject of active investigation, the mechanisms underlying the resolution of inflammation have been
elusive. By gaining insights into the resolution of inflammation during single and super-infection, we will develop
novel therapeutic targets for infection- and immune-related human diseases."

Daily oral PrEP has been scaled up in Kenya for numerous populations, including young women with substantial
risk for HIV. For many young women who start oral PrEP, numerous studies have demonstrated that
discontinuation rates are high and they unlikely benefit from long-term HIV protection. Newer PrEP products that
are longer acting, including dapivirine-eluting vaginal rings and intramuscular injections of cabotegravir, offer 1-
2 months of protection and less dependence on the user to remember to take a daily pill. Following WHO
guidelines, these products are being integrated into clinical guidelines in Kenya and other countries. For daily
oral PrEP, a key strategy for efficient scale up was integration into existing programs, such as those for
reproductive health care (e.g., family planning, antenatal, postabortal care) and we have been studying ways to
optimize integration of PrEP into these settings. Through implementation science research protocols, we have
been working with public clinic staff to introduct PrEP, train providers to delivery PrEP, develop linkages between
clinics and national supply chain mechanisms for PrEP, and support providers and programs to overcome
challenges. Despite documented high levels of interest in PrEP yielding high frequency of PrEP initiation – 13-
35% of eligible women ages 15-30 years in our family planning and post-abortal clinic partners – we have
continued to see high levels of program drop out, non-adherence, and only moderate ability to track whether
PrEP is re-started in alignment with fluctuating sexual behavior and potential exposure to HIV. These barriers to
PrEP continuation are driven by young women’s needs for PrEP products that afford discretion, convenience,
and safety.
It is yet unknown whether the availability of multiple HIV PrEP products in a PrEP program will yield a degree of
choice, support longer term use of PrEP, and ultimately, greater HIV prevention coverage. Through a multi-step
process invoking formative work and a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, the research team proposes to
determine whether the availability of a suite of PrEP options yields greater HIV protection coverage over a 3-
and 6- month period relative to periods when only daily oral PrEP is available. The proposed study aims to: 1)
develop a pathway to add injectable cabotegravir and dapivirine ring into existing PrEP services offered through
in reproductive health clinics in Kenya leveraging qualitative and community-based research methods, 2)
determine whether integration of injectable cabotegravir and dapivirine ring into existing PrEP programs
improves PrEP uptake and persistence among young women accessing reproductive health services via a
stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in 12 facilities, and 3) interrogate potential weak points in the PrEP
choice intervention including: a) provider hesitancy and client experiences, b) quality of choice-based HIV
prevention counseling."
10786148,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A fundamental challenge in developmental biology is to dissect how one multipotent cell differentiates into a
specific cell type. Most studies are limited to 1-dimensional genomic data that measure transcription level (RNA-
seq), protein binding intensity (ChIP-seq), and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq). These datasets lack direct
evidence of communication between various regulatory elements that accommodate gene regulation and
differentiation. To solve this problem, we will leverage cutting-edge 3D genome technologies, ChIA-PET and
ChIA-Drop. By enriching for specific protein factors CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and RNA Polymerase II
(RNAPII), one can interrogate chromatin architecture and gene regulation in aggregated bulk cells (ChIA-PET)
and in a single molecule (ChIA-Drop). We will exploit the highly dissimilar genomes in F1 hybrid mouse strains
derived from mating a laboratory mouse and a wild mouse to assign high-throughput sequencing reads to
parental origin, thereby unraveling the allele-specific gene expression and chromatin interactions. We propose
to: (i) determine whether allele-specific interactions between regulatory elements and methylation status in
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) drive allele-specific gene expression, (ii) quantify cell-to-cell heterogeneity
of multiplex chromatin interactions. We will subsequently differentiate mESCs into three lineage-specific
precursors ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm in vitro. By performing ChIA-PET, we can identify which, if any,
of the pre-established interactions among enhancers, promoters, and CTCF persist or vanish after this process.
ChIA-Drop data will potentially capture the dynamics therein. Throughout the K99 and R00 phases, we will
continue to develop computational algorithms that can: (i) quantitatively assess reproducibility of replicate
experiments, (ii) identify statistically significant differential interactions, and (iii) trace and quantify single-
molecule dynamics and heterogeneity of allele-specific multiplex interactions. To succeed in these aims, the
investigator will expand her knowledge domain to developmental biology and receive additional hands-on
experimental training in 3D genome mapping technologies and mouse embryonic stem cell culture, harvest, and
differentiation techniques. Together, these genome-wide communication links between regulatory elements and
architectural protein will provide insights into gene regulation and genomic imprinting mechanisms during
gastrulation."
10759524,"Recent decades have dramatically changed our view of RNA. While RNA was initially believed to be barely
a passive messenger in the transfer of genetic information from DNA to proteins, it is now clear that RNA is
an exciting and underexplored regulatory molecule that will continue to deliver new discoveries in biology
and medicine. Our research program strives to capitalize on these exciting future discoveries by exploring
chemical modifications to modulate the structure and function regulatory RNAs. The long-term goals are to
1) develop novel RNA chemical modifications for fundamental studies and biomedical applications, and 2)
explore new modes of sequence-specific recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our research
program comprises two distinct but interrelated projects: 1) novel backbone modifications to improve
specificity of regulatory RNAs, and 2) triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to modulate structure and
biological activity regulatory RNAs. Project 1 replaces internucleotide phosphates with amides and other
non-native linkages in short interfering RNAs and RNAs associated with clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The goals are to optimize the activity and sequence specificity of these
RNAs. The premise is that backbone modifications will remodel and improve RNA-protein interactions and,
hence, modulate the activity and specificity. Project 2 explores chemically modified PNA as a ligand for
sequence-specific conformational and functional control of biomedically important dsRNA. The goals are to
develop PNAs that shift between alternative structures of complex RNAs and to improve the cellular uptake
of PNA. The premise is that nucleobase-modified triplex-forming PNAs are uniquely suited for sequence-
specific recognition of dsRNA and will enable recognition of biologically important non-coding dsRNA. New
future directions will focus on biological activity of PNAs, especially, in phase-separated membrane-less
organelles. The projects involve collaborations with structural biochemists (Martin Egli, Janez Plavec),
biological chemists (Naoki Sugimoto), and biotech companies (Korro Bio, Inc.). The two projects share a
common theme of designing chemical modifications that take advantage of charge complementarity
between the RNA target and the ligands and proteins interacting with RNA. The overreaching idea is to
develop RNA chemical modifications and RNA binding ligands that avoid unproductive electrostatic
repulsion and capitalize on productive electrostatic attraction while concurrently enhancing sequence
specificity of molecular interactions. This thrust grows out of our recent discoveries that RNA is unusually
receptive to chemical modifications that neutralize the negative charge of phosphate backbone, both in RNA
itself and in RNA binding oligonucleotide analogues. If successful, our research will contribute to addressing
key gaps in RNA interference, CRISPR, and PNA technologies for recognition of therapeutically relevant
RNAs, and will open doors for development of unique research tools and new therapeutic strategies."

The health of the brain vasculature is essential for Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from the deposition
of amyloid proteins onto blood vessels, and is observed in a very high percentage of patients with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), as well as in AD animal models. It has been proposed that central nervous system (CNS)
macrophages are important in keeping the brain clean of toxic depositions. Microglia are the most abundant
macrophages in the CNS. There are also non-microglial macrophages, which in this application are called
Border-Associated macrophages (BAM). Our central hypothesis is that microglia, due to its parenchymal
location, keeps clean the brain from unused neural connection, while BAM, which have a perivascular location,
exert similar functions but targeting the vasculature. The dominant population (70-80%) of BAM in young adult
mice is comprised of cells that express high levels of CD206, Lyve1, CD38 and Tim4, and low levels of MHC
class II molecules (CD206HI MHC IILO). Imaging studies show that these cells are tightly associated with the
blood vasculature, displaying a high capacity to endocytose macromolecules injected into the blood circulation.
Our data show that BAMs’ endocytic capacity is impaired in aged mice as well as mice with CAA. It is, however,
difficult to study the role of BAMs without the availability of specific reagents. We have developed three mouse
strains, Lyve1-Cre X Maf f/f, LysM-Cre Maf f/f, and Csf1r-Cre Maf f/f that lacks CD206HI MHC IILO BAMs but have
an intact microglial compartment. This is the first genetic tool that can be used to specifically target perivascular
macrophages in the brain. CD206HI BAM-deficient mice have expanded brain vasculature in your mice, and
exaggerated amyloid deposition in a mouse model of CAA. We therefore believe that BAM are important to
maintain the vasculature, and that our genetic tool will be useful in clarifying BAM’s function."

Watts is a community in Southeast Los Angeles that has faced systematic disinvestment, discrimination,
and resource deprivation, resulting in health disparities across multiple domains including high rates of
diabetes and obesity, high pollution burdens and limited employment opportunities. Watts residents,
almost exclusively people of color, (73% Latinx and 25% Black/African American), have a life expectancy
twelve years lower than other parts of Los Angeles, largely due to decades of neglect the community has
faced. This proposal builds on the work of the existing Watts Rising Collaborative (WRC) to address this
neglect through a community-led approach to develop and evaluate an intervention that will address
two primary structural factors that contribute to these disparities and health outcomes: access to
resources and food insecurity and economic instability. The project will be developed through a
partnership between the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, the University of California Los
Angeles and Charles Drew University as well as the 50 members of the WRC and Watts residents. We
will employ an intervention mapping process to refine an intervention that will develop a network of
community gardens that will provide opportunities for increased access to healthy foods, green space
and physical activity as well as entrepreneurial opportunities for businesses utilizing food from the
gardens. Ultimately, we anticipate the intervention will decrease rates of preventable chronic disease in
Watts and provide opportunities for workforce development. This intervention has the potential to
positively affect the entirety of the Watts community of approximately 40,000 residents."

 Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a major complication and the leading cause of death and disability in
patients with diabetes. Effective treatment to improve outcomes is lacking, and prognosis remains poor
for patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Thus, there is a growing unmet clinical need for novel
therapeutic approaches in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Exercise is an effective strategy for the prevention
and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly
understood. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is the most common form of RNA modification in
eukaryotes. METTL3, a m6A methyltransferase, has been implicated in cardiac development and cardiac
injury, however, little is known about the role of METTL3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy and cardiac benefit
of exercise in diabetes. Our preliminary studies found that (1) Cardiac METTL3 is downregulated in
diabetes and is upregulated by exercise. (2) Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of METT3 cancels
beneficial effects of exercise on hearts from diabetes. (3) In vitro in primary cardiomyocytes,
overexpression of METTL3 protects cardiomyocytes from high glucose and palmitate-induced oxidative
stress and cell death. (4) METTL3 regulates YBX-1 in diabetic hearts. We hypothesize that METTL3 is
sufficient/necessary in cardiac benefits of exercise in diabetes and its does so through YBX-1. We will
test this hypothesis in three specific aims: (1) to determine the role of METTL3 in cardiac response to
exercise in diabetes, (2) to examine the effects of METTL3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy, and (3) to examine
the mechanisms by which METTL3 regulates diabetic cardiomyopathy. We anticipate that these studies
will shed new lights into the role of m6A (e.g., METTL3) in the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Moreover, these studies will establish clinically relevant approaches targeting METTL3 to combat
cardiomyopathy in patients with diabetes.

Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) has its first incidence peak in the adolescent and young adults (AYA)
years. Despite the success of chemotherapy and radiation in younger children and older adults,
there has been a gap in survival for AYA. In addition, this group is at risk for decreased access
to clinical trials. With the availability of antibody drug conjugates and immunotherapies that can
treat HL, there is a promise that we can reduce the morbidity of historic chemotherapy and
radiation regimens that limit long term overall survival further in AYAs and in black and Hispanic
patients. In her role as the Scientific Chair of the HL committee in the Children’s Oncology
Group (COG), Dr. Castellino’s goal is to accelerate the incorporation of immunotherapy and
CD30-targeted cellular therapy into children and AYAs through collaborative trials with the
NCTN groups both for initial therapy and for relapsed and refractory disease. She also plans to
deliver trial designs that incorporate emerging tumor-microenvironment and host biology in HL
for better risk stratification and response-based approaches. On a national level she also
proposes advances through leadership in the NODAL data commons and through analyses
linking trial data to extant epidemiologic data and post treatment follow up. At the institutional
level, as the Program leader for Leukemia and Lymphoma at the Aflac Cancer and Blood
Disorders Center of the Winship Cancer Institute, she proposes to lead systematic quality
initiatives to enhance trial enrollment in AYAs and in patients of under-represented race and
ethnicity in Georgia. Her leadership of the leukemia and lymphoma biorepository can be
extended to creating infrastructure to bank lymphoma tissue which can enhance translational
work toward precision trial designs for relapsed HL and rare lymphomas. The effort support
through the R50 award would allow her time to accelerate trials in lymphoma nationally and to
enhance AYA accrual locally. Her experience and productivity to date position her for success in
the role of the R50 Clinical Research specialist."
10782930,"Substance use disorders (SUD) are characterized by pathological behavioral engagement with rewarding stimuli
despite negative outcomes. There has been a concerted effort to identify the neural correlates of reward receipt,
as well as the systems-level processes that govern chronic cannabis use disorders, a growing problem in the
US. There remains a lack of mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic neurobiology which underlies behavioral
engagement, a fundamental process in drug seeking behavior. As such, the primary goal of this pathway to
independence proposal will be to receive in depth neuroscience training, facilitating new skills in a series of
cutting-edge approaches which will provide a deeper understanding of the underpinnings of neuromodulatory
regulation of engagement in reward-seeking behaviors, and how these mechanisms are altered with chronic
cannabinoid use. The Nucleus Accumbens(NAc) represents an important reward network hub known to regulate
reward engagement and the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse. The NAc receives dense innervation from
the Paraventricular Thalamus(PVT), which receives visceromotor and interoceptive inputs from the
hypothalamus and hindbrain, and projects widely across the forebrain to regulate a variety of motivated
behaviors. The PVT is a highly heterogenous structure, and recent studies examining the PVT-NAc circuit have
shown conflicting results, partially driven by a lack of genetic and anatomical specificity within the PVT. The
neuromodulatory peptide neurotensin(NTS) is selectively expressed in the anterior PVT and our preliminary data
demonstrates that these neurons send excitatory projections to the NAc, which are enriched with the cannabinoid
1 receptor(CB1R) and tightly regulated via endogenous cannabinoid(eCB) signaling. In this proposal, we first aim
to understand how eCB modulation of aPVT projections to the NAc regulates behavioral engagement. Our
preliminary experiments demonstrate that aPVT projections to the NAc are inhibited during behavioral
engagement and excited upon disengagement, in both rewarding and aversive contexts. In tandem with our
electrophysiology data demonstrating retrograde eCB inhibition of PVT terminals, we will determine when and
how eCBs are released in vivo to modulate aPVT input to ultimately affect behavioral engagement. Our second
aim will be to determine how the activity of projection defined NAc neurons is causally linked to eCB
production and reward seeking behavior. In this aim, we will use 1-photon imaging to record the activity of
specific aPVT-NAc projection ensembles. We will multiplex this high-resolution neural data with novel machine
learning behavioral tracking algorithms to directly correlate neural activity with discrete aspects of reward seeking
behaviors. Finally, in the R00 portion of this grant, I will expand the scope of this study to other aPVT output
regions to determine how the aPVT regulates cannabinoid seeking behaviors through divergent efferent
projections across the forebrain. The training received under this proposal will facilitate my transition to
heading my own independent academic research laboratory focused on decoding neuromodulation in SUD."

The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide
Colm Travers, MD, with the mentorship, training, and research experience needed to become an
independent clinician scientist and leader in neonatal pulmonary outcomes research. His long-term career
goal is to reduce the increasing burden of respiratory morbidity among the 360,000 survivors of preterm birth
per year in the US through novel observational and interventional studies and large scale multi-center clinical
trials of interventions that reduce lung injury. To achieve these goals and transition to independence, Dr.
Travers and his mentors developed a comprehensive research and career development plan that includes
mentorship from an exceptional team of scientists with proven track records of mentorship; intensive didactic
training including completion of a Master of Science in Public Health in Outcomes Research; and a research
plan that is purposefully designed to provide experiential learning in advanced research methods to study
pulmonary outcomes among preterm infants. Survivors of preterm birth are at increased risk for wheeze,
asthma, and abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs) during childhood. Studies of lung function in preterm
infants have been limited by the difficulties with completing infant PFTs, restricting the ability to measure
illness severity, assess response to treatments, and understand developmental lung health trajectories. Dr.
Travers recently completed two prospective cohort studies using an innovative non-invasive oscillometry
technique to quantify pulmonary mechanics in spontaneously breathing term and preterm infants. His early
work observed that differences in lung mechanics between term and preterm infants can be reproducibly
measured and persist until discharge. In the research plan outlined in this K23 proposal, Dr. Travers will
expand upon this novel work, and his specific research aims are directly aligned with his training plan as
follows: (1) To determine the extent to which differences in lung mechanics between healthy term infants
and preterm infants with and without lung disease after birth persist until discharge from hospital or 40 weeks’
postmenstrual age, (2) To quantify changes in lung mechanics among preterm infants receiving medications
for lung disease, and (3) To determine the extent to which abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics detected
before discharge persist and predict longer-term pulmonary outcomes at 24 months. A non-invasive method
to measure lung mechanics and predict longer-term pulmonary outcomes before discharge from hospital can
fundamentally change our understanding of the effect of early postnatal lung development on lung function
in preterm infants. In addition, a non-invasive bedside device that objectively measures response to
treatments would be both a vital research and clinical tool. Building upon the skills and insights acquired
through the proposed training and research plan, Dr. Travers will apply for an R01 to determine the effects
of early interventions and therapies on lung mechanics and pulmonary health in early childhood."

Synapses are fundamental to nervous system function and information processing in the normal and
pathological brain. They are highly dynamic structures capable of supporting high firing rates and displaying a
broad range of plasticity. A detailed picture of the molecular interactions occurring within a synapse is required
to understand how synaptic protein dynamics ultimately shape activity in the nervous system in health and
disease.
In this proposal, we will investigate Munc13 and complexin (CPX), both highly conserved molecules that are
crucial for proper synaptic function. Mice lacking complexin die at birth, and loss of a single isoform is
associated with profound locomotor, sensory, and behavioral deficits. A human Cpx1 point mutation is
associated with severe intellectual disability and seizures, and CPX expression is altered in a host of
psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease.
Although it is well-established that complexin plays a major role in synaptic function, its mode of action is
controversial: there is evidence for both facilitatory and inhibitory roles of this protein in the regulation of
synaptic transmission. Munc13 is a large synaptic hub protein that coordinates several proteins involved in
synaptic vesicle fusion, and human mutations are associated with ALS, fatal myasthenia, microcephaly, and
severe autism. We propose to study the molecular mechanisms underlying Munc13 and CPX function at the
synapse using a unique and powerful combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches including physiology,
quantitative imaging, behavioral assays, genetics, and protein/lipid biochemistry.
We have developed innovative methods of investigating protein interactions in vivo by monitoring the dynamics
of proteins exchanging between neighboring synapses using photoactivatable GFP. We will deploy these
methods in C. elegans as a model system in which to study the protein interactions of CPX as well as domains
of Munc13 and their binding partners in a functional synapse. By mutating either the pGFP-tagged protein or
its binding partners, we have established that affinity changes lead to mobility changes. We will also elucidate
the structure of CPX and Munc13 protein domains that mediate critical membrane interactions using a
combination of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Detailed structure-function analyses will be
conducted on a domain of Munc13 recently discovered in our lab.
The experiments proposed here will provide new insights into the mechanisms that control neurotransmitter
release, its modulation, and use-dependent plasticity in the brain."
10771120,"Summary:  Many  chemotherapeutics  kill  cancer  cells  by  inducing  DNA  damage  interfering  with  DNA 
replication. Replication forks can reverse to aid the repair of DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutics, and 
BRCA  proteins  are  key  to  protecting  the  reversed  forks  from  nucleolytic  degradation.  In  absence  of  BRCA, 
reversed  replication  forks  are  extensively  degraded  by  nucleases,  leading  to  chemosensitivity.  Moreover, 
chemoresistance has been linked to the restored ability of BRCA-­deficient cells to protect forks from degradation 
through  mechanisms  that  remain  unclear.  Thus,  understanding  how  cells  protect  stalled  DNA  replication  forks 
and promote their recovery is critically important for developing and improving strategies for cancer therapy. In 
this application, we combine the expertise from the Zou and Vindigni laboratories to investigate the mechanisms 
of  DNA  replication  fork  protection  and  recovery  in  BRCA1-­proficient  (Aim  1)  and  -­deficient  (Aim  2)  cells.  The 
Zou lab has extensive experience in the ATR signaling pathway, which is crucial for stabilizing the genome during 
DNA replication. The Vindigni lab has discovered principal steps of the fork reversal pathway. Working together, 
we  have  uncovered  a  number  of  new  players  involved  in  fork  protection.  In  the  preliminary  studies  leading  to 
Aim  1,  we  found  that  ATR plays a  previously unrecognized  role  in protecting  stalled/reversed  replication  forks 
from  nucleolytic  degradation  in  BRCA1-­proficient  cells.  We  also  showed  that  ATR  is  required  for  the  efficient 
recovery of stalled forks. Based on this premise, we hypothesize that ATR acts locally at stalled replication forks 
to protect reversed forks from nucleolytic degradation and to promote their restart after drug removal. Aim 1 will 
determine  the  mechanisms by  which  ATR protects  stalled/reversed forks and promotes  fork  restart in  BRCA1-­
proficient cells. In the preliminary studies leading to Aim 2, we have investigated how stalled forks are protected 
and how they recover in cells lacking BRCA1. We found that extensively degraded replication forks in BRCA1-­
deficient  cells  can  recover  through  a  pathway  mediated  by  Rad18  and  Ubc13.  Furthermore,  when  BRCA1-­
deficient cells acquire PARP inhibitor resistance, fork protection is restored via a PALB2-­dependent mechanism, 
which  relies on ATR  activity.  Notably,  both  Ubc13  and  PALB2  are  functionally  linked  to the  E3  ubiquitin  ligase 
RNF168, raising the possibility that Ubc13, RNF168, and PALB2 may act in the same axis to protect stalled forks 
and  promote  fork  recovery  independently  of  BRCA1.  We  hypothesize  that  both  Ubc13  and  PALB2  have 
unanticipated  roles  in  fork  recovery/protection  in  the  absence  of  BRCA1,  and  their  functions  may  be  linked  by 
RNF168.  Aim 2  will  investigate how  Ubc13 promotes  fork  recovery  in BRCA1-­deficient  cells,  how PALB2 and 
ATR  protect  stalled  forks  in  BRCA1-­deficient  PARP  inhibitor-­resistant  cells,  and  whether  a  Ubc13-­RNF168-­
PALB2 axis promotes both fork protection and fork recovery in the absence of BRCA1. Collectively, these studies 
will transform current models of fork stabilization and recovery in BRCA1-­proficient and -­deficient cells, providing 
a mechanistic basis for new therapeutic strategies that exploit the replication stress in cancer cells.   "

Approximately 8,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with germ cell tumors (GCTs) each year, and the vast
majority are young men who develop testicular GCTs. Most patients are cured with conventional
chemotherapy, although 30% recur, and half of such patients ultimately succumb to their disease. Given the
long life expectancy of these patients, when death from GCT occurs, it accounts for among the greatest
number of life years lost of any non-childhood malignancy representing. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that GCTs exhibit an extreme burden of reciprocal loss of heterozygosity (RLOH) and high
degree of mitochondrial priming for apoptosis. The goal of this proposal is to dissect the molecular features
that initiate RLOH in GCTs, determine the relationship between RLOH and defect DNA checkpoints as tumors
progress, and evaluate the ability of functional assays to identify highest risk disease prior to chemotherapy
initiation. The long-term objective is to enable new mechanisms of patient stratification and identify new
therapeutic targets for chemoresistant GCTs, currently an area of unmet medical need with extremely limited
therapeutic options under investigation. This proposal is unique in that it leverages the extensive and novel

leading to chemoresistant germ cell tumors, and 3) To assess the clinical utility of pluripotency markers as
prognostic for GCT outcomes. These studies will define the meiotic defects underlying RLOH in GCTs, identify
the secondary molecular defects that initiate lethal chemoresistance, and reveal targets for enhanced patient
stratification and therapeutic development. In addition, these efforts will accelerate development of new
computational algorithms that explore integrative molecular analyses of both the genome and epigenome to
address specific hypotheses regarding oncogenic development and progression to chemoresistance that may
have broad applicability. Finally, this project will accelerate the clinical and molecular characterization of GCTs,
explore the underlying biology driving this rare tumor type, and serve more broadly as an innovative model for

The primary goal of this application is to determine the mechanisms by which pancreatic triglyceride lipase
(PNLIP) variants increase the risk for chronic pancreatitis (CP) in humans. Proteotoxicity caused by misfolded
mutant digestive enzymes has been recognized as a novel trypsin-independent mechanism for CP, referred to
as misfolding CP. Recent studies indicate that the development of CP is often a process of discrete recurrent
acute pancreatitis (RAP) driven by genetic risk factors. Restoring proteostasis in the presence of misfolded
proteins is an attractive therapeutic strategy to stop RAP and prevent progression to end-stage disease in
misfolding CP patients. Critical knowledge gaps remain in understanding how misfolded proteins contribute to
pancreatitis onset and progression primarily stemming from the paucity of animal models that recapitulate
misfolding CP in humans. We have developed a pre-clinical model of human PNLIP T221M disease. PNLIP
has no known role in trypsinogen activation or trypsin inactivation. In vitro, PNLIP T221M misfolds and causes
proteotoxicty by triggering unmitigated ER stress. Our preliminary data show that Pnlip T221M mice exhibit
progressive pancreatic acinar atrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and apoptotic and necrotic cell
death; the pathological changes occur as early as at 1 month and become severe at 3-4 month. Our working
hypothesis is that proteins encoded by risk variants of PNLIP cause CP by gain-of-function proteotoxicity
through protein misfolding. To test this hypothesis, first we will systematically characterize Pnlip T221 mice
including CP-like phenotypes, secondary complications, and the susceptibility to pancreatic injury when being
challenged with ethanol feeding. Second, we will methodically investigate early biological responses triggered
by pancreatic expression of pathogenic PNLIP T221M in mice to uncover potential novel targets to halt or
prevent disease onset and progression. Third, we will assess the prevalence of protein misfolding and
proteotoxicity underlies the disease mechanism of PNLIP variants of uncertain significance (VUS) found in CP
patients using cell cultures and another mouse model of Pnlip F300L. Completion of these studies will
establish mutation-induced misfolding of digestive enzymes as a relevant disease mechanism in the
pathogenesis of CP and will identify potential therapeutic targets to stop RAP and prevent CP."

Radiotherapy and chemoradiation for head and neck cancer treatment exposes normal tissues to radiation,
which has many devastating effects and often results in difficulty with communication and swallowing. While
muscle weakness and fibrosis are possible etiologies for disruptions in critical communicative and deglutition
functions following radiation, very little research has been performed on underlying biological changes within
muscles of the head and neck following radiation, or possible treatments for these lasting negative effects.
Skeletal muscles can adapt at multiple levels of structure and function to changing demands. Exercise training
of the tongue, or enhanced muscle contraction via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may be
beneficial for preventing or reversing muscle tissue damage. However, controlled research examining these
putative benefits has not been performed and optimal treatment modalities have not been established. Our
hypothesis is that radiotherapy and chemoradiation-induced decline in speech and swallowing function is
largely due to alterations in tongue muscle structure and function. Further, we hypothesize that tongue
exercise or NMES will result in phenotypic changes in extrinsic tongue muscles that will improve tongue
muscle function. To examine these clinically-relevant issues, we will use a rat model to test two different
tongue treatment paradigms (tongue exercise; NMES) for remediation of radiotherapy and chemoradiation-
induced muscle damage. The proposed research has two specific aims: 1) To determine how treatment
modality affects morphological, biochemical, and physiological changes in radiotherapy and chemoradiation-
induced muscle damage of the tongue, 2) To discover how tongue exercise and/or NMES treatment affects
functional measures of deglutition following radiotherapy/chemoradiation. This work is innovative and
significant because the mechanisms by which tongue exercise or NMES can prevent or treat the effects of
radiation- or chemoradiation-induced communication and swallowing dysfunction is largely unexplored. Our
animal model and treatments are analogs to treatments used in human patients and follow the Institute of
Medicine guidelines for increasing probability of translation. Further, this work is highly significant in providing a
basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying the potential of therapeutic interventions for radiation- and
chemoradiation-induced cranial impairments. Translation of findings will assist with increasing the
effectiveness of treatments for radiation- and chemoradiation-induced tongue muscle impairments that are so
prevalent in patients with head and neck cancer."

This project will assess the medium-term impact of a large-scale national anti-poverty program on disease and
health risk of mature adults (age 45+) and young adults (age 20-26). We build on a longitudinal randomized
control trial designed to evaluate the impact of an unconditional cash transfer program in a low-income setting.
A fourth wave of data on the study population will include new measures of immune response, disease risk,
and cognitive capacity. Combing these measures with information from previous waves, including the pre-
intervention period, will allow us to map out the biological, behavioral and economic pathways through which a
cash transfer program influences health at two points in the life-cycle.
Specifically, we will exploit the exogenous change in income evoked by random assignment to early-entry
treatment condition to estimate the causal effect of income poverty on immune function, and the role of stress
in mediating this relationship. We will also estimate the causal effect of the cash transfer on a range of
indicators of disease risk. Half the young adults in our sample were exposed to the cash transfer during their
critical adolescence years, allowing us to estimate the impact of the cash on their disease risk. By providing
estimates for both mature and younger adults, we can observe whether the hypothesized relationship vary
across the life-course. The proposal addresses the National Institute of Ageing's Goal B to `better understand
the effects of personal, interpersonal, and societal factors on ageing, including mechanisms through which
these factors exert their effects.' Within Goal B, the proposal responds to objective B1: `Illuminate the pathways
by which social, psychological, economic, and behavioral factors affect health in middle-aged and older adults.'"
10784678,"The vast majority of all trauma-related amputations in the United States involve the upper limbs.
Approximately half of those individuals who receive an upper extremity myoelectric prosthesis eventually
abandon use of the system, primarily because of their limited functionality. Thus, there continues to be a need
for a significant improvement in prosthetic control strategies.
 The objective of this bioengineering research program is to develop and clinically evaluate a prototype
prosthetic control system that uses imaging to sense residual muscle activity, rather than electromyography.
This novel approach can better distinguish between different functional compartments in the forearm muscles,
and provide robust control signals that are proportional to muscle activity. This improved sensing strategy has
the potential to significantly improve functionality of upper extremity prostheses, and provide dexterous intuitive
control that is a significant improvement over current state of the art noninvasive control methods. This
interdisciplinary project brings together investigators at George Mason University, commercial partners at
Infinite Biomedical Technologies and clinicians at MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital and Hanger Clinic.
Specific Aim 1: To develop and test a compact research-grade sonomyographic prosthetic system
We will develop and evaluate a compact low-power embedded system for sonomyography. We will optimize
and implement algorithms for real-time classification and control with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). We
will then integrate ultrasound imaging transducers within test prosthetic sockets for testing on individuals with
transradial limb loss in a laboratory setting. We will complete system integration and testing and evaluate the
sonomyographic signal quality with changes in arm position and socket loading.
Specific Aim 2: To evaluate performance of sonomyographic control compared to myoelectric control
We will compare the performance of SMG vs myoelectric direct control with mode switching in myoelectric-
naïve subjects with transradial amputation. Assessment will be performed using a virtual reality Fitts’ law task
as well as clinical outcome measures using a terminal device. The primary outcome measure will be the
SHAP and secondary outcome measure will be the Clothespin Relocation Task. We will assess intuitiveness
of control using gaze tracking, and also study quality of movement. We will also compare the performance of
SMG vs myoelectric pattern recognition with proportional control in subjects who have been trained on a
commercial PR system using the same outcome measures.
The successful completion of this project will lead to the first in human evaluation of an integrated prototype
that uses low-power portable imaging sensors and real-time image analysis to sense residual muscle activity
for prosthetic control. In the long term, we anticipate that the improvements in functionality and intuitiveness of
control will increase acceptance by amputees."
10784718,"It is well-known that in most people, cognitive abilities decline with age. With the elderly population growing
(20% of Americans will be over 65 by 2030), this represents a significant public health concern. However, not
all older adults show this pattern of decline. We and others have demonstrated that some individuals seem to
be resilient to age-related decline, even in the setting of biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
neuropathologic changes. Understanding the factors that promote resilience in older adults could point to new
approaches to achieve healthy aging in all adults.
In our recent studies of aging, we identified substantial heterogeneity within older adults in memory
performance and both brain anatomy and connectivity, such that some older participants (60-80 yrs.) were
indistinguishable from young adults (18-32). These remarkable individuals offer the opportunity to investigate
the biobehavioral mechanisms that contribute to successful aging.
Our findings indicated that successful agers (who showed preserved anatomy within and connectivity between
multiple limbic and paralimbic structures that subserve motivation, affect, and cognition) exhibited a distinct
neural response to challenging tasks when compared to typical agers. Crucially, successful agers also differed
in their subjective experience of the task, rating the arousal caused by the task as significantly more pleasant.
Together, these results suggest that individual differences in the response to increasing arousal during difficult
cognitive tasks contribute meaningfully to cognitive outcomes in aging.
Here, we introduce the Arousal along the Challenge/Threat Continuum (ACT-C) model, which hypothesizes
that arousal can be helpful or harmful to cognition, depending on how it is expressed in the brain and the body
In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis of the ACT-C model, that individual differences in the
experience of affect, and its neurobiological and autonomic physiological correlates predicts cognitive
performance in aging. We propose that increased effort and cognitive performance will be associated with a
tendency to subjectively experience arousal more as challenge than as threat (Aim 1), an autonomic
physiological response to difficult tasks previously associated with a challenge interpretation (i.e. decreased
vascular resistance, Aim 2), and a neural ‘challenge’ pattern involving increased mid-cingulate activity and
communication between networks (Aim 3). Crucially, we predict that these motivational, physiological, and
neural factors will be associated with improved performance even in individuals with evidence of preclinical AD.
This research, if successful, will provide much-needed insight into the biological mechanisms by which affect
and motivation support cognitive aging. The outcomes of this research could point the way to neural and
physiological biomarkers predicting successful aging, which could be used to evaluate interventions to promote
successful aging, including in people with biomarker evidence of Preclinical AD."
10784720,"Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Numerous studies have confirmed that physical exercise
has positive effects in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. The majority of the studies examining
the effect of physical exercise in animal models of neurodegeneration have reported neuroprotection, improved
memory and cognitive performance. The molecular mechanisms of the interactions between the non-neuronal
systems involved in the physical/aerobic exercise and brain, however, remain poorly understood. The
antiaging protein, α-Klotho, has well-known neuroprotective activity, and recent studies demonstrated that systemic
elevation of α-Klotho protein in transgenic mice or injection of soluble α-Klotho fragment, enhanced cognition and
neural resilience in young, aging, and a murine disease model. Recent reports have suggested that α-Klotho levels
decline in brain of animal models of AD. It has been recently shown that physical aerobic exercise increases the
circulating levels of α-Klotho, and we have found that direct muscle contraction via neuromuscular electrical
stimulation significantly enhanced α-Klotho expression in the hippocampus. These findings raised the novel
hypothesis that skeletal muscle may be a regulator of circulating α-Klotho. We posit that muscle-induced stimulation
of α-Klotho may play a role in the beneficial effect of exercise on cognitive outcomes. Importantly, it has been
established that signals from periphery to the CNS are transmitted through mechanisms highly specific to choroid
plexus (CP) epithelium, and physical exercise increases the release and amount of extracellular vesicles into the
circulation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that α-Klotho is detectable at high levels in exosomes isolated from
plasma, and that muscle contractile activity increases the release and amount of α-Klotho-containing exosomes in
circulation. We also show that the exosomal cargo can transmit a signal to cells in vitro, thus affecting the expression
level of intracellular proteins. We hypothesize that the effects of physical exercise on CNS are results of signals
generated in peripheral muscles and transmitted to the brain via the CP epithelium. The signals are associated
with and depend on increased circulating levels of anti-aging protein,α-Klotho, released by muscles within
exosomes. This interdisciplinary research will integrate the expertise of AD researchers experienced with AD animal
models, analysis of AD-like pathology and omix approaches (R. Koldamova & I. Lefterov), established researchers
in biology of α-Klotho, rehabilitation, and aging (F. Ambrosio) and cell biology (C. St Croix). The goal of this proposal
is to further our understanding of the interactions between α-Klotho expression in skeletal muscles, physical activity
and brain, and to elucidate the relationship of age-related changes in skeletal muscle and progression of AD. Aim 1:
To determine if the effects of physical exercise on phenotype and gene expression in the hippocampus and cortex
are mediated by α-Klotho. Aim 2: To reveal the effect of muscle training on exosomal cargo in plasma and CSF,
and to integrate their proteomic and miRNA profiles with the phenotype and brain transcriptomes. Aim 3: To
elucidate the role of Choroid Plexus and α-Klotho in communicating signals from peripheral muscles to CNS."
10784722,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In response to PAR-20-036: Getting to Zero: Understanding HIV Viral Suppression and Transmission in the
United States, we propose a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study that will evaluate an innovative
clinic-level intervention featuring an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) application (CHESS) and peer-
driven social support. Within the infrastructure of a large HIV/AIDS Service Organization offering an integrated,
patient-centered model of care in Colorado, Missouri, Texas and Wisconsin, we will implement an mHealth
system designed to close information gaps, build intrinsic motivation, and develop behavioral skills needed for
sustained adherence to treatment. Peer support will be provided through activities delivered by patients
recruited and trained to serve as peer mentors. The mHealth system and peer mentoring will be integrated into
the existing care model, known as the HIV Medical Home. We hypothesize that the integrated intervention will
increase the proportion of patients with viral suppression and reduce missed clinic appointments by supporting
three needs: (1) It will facilitate real-time, community-based capture of data reflecting social and behavioral
determinants known to precede lapses in HIV care (e.g., housing and food insecurity, unhealthy alcohol or
drug use, or poor medication adherence); (2) It will improve engagement in care by increasing social
connectedness among patients, and between patients and peer mentors; and (3) It will support retention in
addiction treatment and mental health care that help maintain engagement in HIV care. Project Year 1 will be
devoted to planning and refinement of the intervention in close collaboration with organizational leaders and
people living with HIV who are members of the local communities. Beginning in Project Year 2, we will conduct
a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of the intervention in seven clinics. We will leverage data collected
through the integrated electronic health record system serving all seven clinics to test intervention
effectiveness on viral suppression and retention in care. We also will conduct an implementation cost analysis
and cost-effectiveness analysis to inform future sustainment of the intervention model. The study builds on a
solid foundation of prior research demonstrating the promise of mHealth and peer strategies for enhancing
engagement in HIV and addiction treatment and care for other complex conditions. The findings from this
study, if successful, will contribute a new and innovative set of tools with high potential impact for improving
HIV viral suppression in multiple geographic settings."
10763764,"Membrane transporters are essential for cellular life and are generally understudied compared to other
membrane proteins, such as GPCR and ion channels. The long-term goal is to pursue a fundamental mechanistic
understanding of membrane transporters closely related to human diseases. In this proposal, the overall
objective is to extend our previous research on members of human SLC and bacterial siderophore ABC importers.
The rationale is that, with detailed knowledge about the structure-function relationship of these membrane
transporters, it will be possible to design small molecules explicitly targeting them to have physiological effects.
To accomplish the goal, we expect to pursue the following three projects: 1) understanding the substrate
selectivity and promiscuity; 2) probing the connection between transporters’ unique structural features and their
function; and 3) searching for small molecule inhibitors/activators of the transporters. The approach involved in
this proposal is multidisciplinary, including biochemistry, structural biology, microbiology, cell biology, molecular
dynamics simulation, and various methodologies of biophysics. This proposal is significant because it is expected
to reveal the basic molecular mechanisms of essential membrane transporters and provide scientific justification
for further development of drugs targeting these transporters."

The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein spike (Env) mediates viral entry into target cells. Because Env is the only
viral protein on the virion surface, it is central to the development of potential vaccines and small-molecule
entry inhibitors. Env is a uniquely flexible molecular machine, and deep understanding of its immunogenicity
and susceptibility to inhibition requires an appreciation of its atomically resolved conformational dynamics.
Structural studies using truncated, solubilized, and stabilized Env constructs have yielded detailed atomic
models of its main open and closed conformational states. Emerging structural studies of full-length Env
support identification of asymmetric closed conformations as the “default intermediate state” (DIS), revealing
details of a potentially pivotal role of quaternary asymmetry in Env conformational dynamics. At the same time,
both single-molecule FRET (smFRET) and crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) of Env suggest the
existence of at least one, sometimes dominant conformational state that has not been structurally
characterized. This “State-1” conformation nonetheless seems relevant for both immune recognition and
susceptibility to small-molecule inhibitors. We will leverage advanced Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods
including targeted MD, temperature-accelerated MD, and string method to provide atomic level models for the
opening of HIV-1 Env from closed (State 2) to open (State 3) conformational states and to identify critical
structural changes separating State-2 from the poorly understood State-1 Env. The MD simulation methods we
use will incorporate biases from multi-perspective smFRET and XL-MS, and they will in turn provide direction
for expanding the set of Env constructs used in those experiments, establishing an iterative approach that
progressively better defines transition mechanisms and State 1. An atomic-level understanding of HIV-1 Env
conformational dynamics, identification of a yet to be structurally characterized pre-triggered conformational
states, as well as the mechanism of Env activation for fusion will inform immunogen design and antiviral
therapies."

90% of individuals diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, but the underlying
mechanisms that govern sex bias in autoimmune disease are not understood. Susceptibility to SLE increases
with the number of X chromosomes carried by an individual, and increased expression of X-linked genes has
been found in women with SLE. These findings suggest that gene expression from two X chromosomes likely
contributes to female-biased SLE pathogenesis. The dosage of X-linked gene expression in mammals with more
than one X chromosome is balanced by epigenetically silencing one X chromosome through X-chromosome
inactivation (XCI). XCI is maintained in somatic cells by association of repressive epigenetic features with the
inactive X chromosome (Xi), including coating of the Xi with the long non-coding RNA Xist. Despite these
repressive features, some genes have been shown to escape silencing from the Xi. Our lab discovered that B
cells, a key cell type in SLE pathogenesis, have “dynamic” maintenance of XCI, where naïve B cells lack visible
Xist RNA signal yet demonstrate re-localization of Xist RNA to the Xi upon activation. Dynamic XCI maintenance
is disrupted and X-linked immune genes are aberrantly expressed in SLE B cells, suggesting that impaired
localization of repressive epigenetic marks on the Xi may cause aberrant escape of immune genes from the Xi,
enhancing B cell activity. “Age-associated B cells” (ABCs) are emerging as a critical cell type in female-biased
autoimmunity and respond robustly to signaling through the TLR7 pathway. Several TLR7 pathway members
are X-linked and have been identified as risk variants in SLE. To determine the importance of contributions from
the X chromosome in female-biased SLE, I will define epigenetic features of the Xi in ABCs and elucidate the
impact of perturbed XCI maintenance in the B cell compartment on SLE pathogenesis. In Aim 1, I hypothesize
that ABCs have dynamic XCI maintenance, and that X-linked immune-regulatory genes escape silencing in
ABCs. I will isolate murine splenic B cells and visualize the association of repressive epigenetic features with the
Xi during differentiation and activation of ABCs and perform allele-specific RNA sequencing to determine genes
that escape silencing in ABCs. In Aim 2, I will build on my preliminary data that demonstrates that female mice
with a B cell-specific Xist deletion yielding perturbed XCI (“Xist cKO”) are more susceptible to spontaneous and
chemically-induced SLE-like disease. I hypothesize that impaired XCI maintenance in female Xist cKO mice
leads to upregulation of immune-regulatory X-linked genes, yielding B cells that differentiate more readily into
effector populations and produce more antibodies upon stimulation. I will assay transcriptional and functional
characteristics of B cells from female Xist cKO mice at steady state and during the development of spontaneous
and chemically induced SLE. Investigating the epigenetic mechanisms of XCI maintenance in ABCs will reveal
how genetic contributions from the Xi are critical for ABC function, and for the first time will illuminate an X
chromosome-based mechanism that underlies female-biased autoimmunity."

Nigeria has the 4th highest global burden of HIV and an uncontrolled epidemic. Among youth aged 15-24, HIV
incidence remains high and rates of viral suppression low. The HIV epidemic in Nigeria's youth is highest in
men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW). Although external (i.e., non-governmental)
funders support key population-focused centers to increase access to HIV services for MSM and TW, their
reach is limited by dwindling and unsustainable funding. Efforts to improve the capacity of government clinics
to reach and care for young MSM (YMSM) and young TW (YTW) as well as to implement effective, scalable,
youth-specific interventions with enhanced prevention, improved case-finding, and increased ART access and
adherence support for youth living with HIV (YLH) are critical to turn around lagging indicators across the HIV
prevention and care continuum. However, to-date, no interventions have undergone rigorous effectiveness and
implementation research in Nigeria's complex sociocultural milieu. iCARE Nigeria is a successful NICHD-
funded PATC3H research partnership investigating two youth-specific interventions to improve: (1) HIV case-
finding and linkage-to-care among YMSM and YTW, and (2) adherence and viral suppression among largely
vertically-infected YLH on ART. Each intervention combines evidence-based peer navigation and mHealth
strategies adapted to the local context; feasibility and efficacy were shown in a pilot study (UG3). We herein
propose iCARE Plus, to scale out and test effectiveness and implementation outcomes on enhanced versions
of the iCARE interventions within the newly formed PATC3H-IN. The iCARE Plus Clinical Research Center
(CRC) will conduct hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials that will utilize an EPIS (Exploration, Preparation,
Implementation, and Sustainment) framework to contextualize intervention implementation in youth aged 15-24
through new Clinical Research Performance Sites (CRPSs) in HIV “hotspots” across Nigeria's six geopolitically
distinct zones. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 (Preparation): Implementation preparation will be carried out at
selected government clinics in the HIV hotspots, while increasing their capacity and capability to provide
services to YMSM and YTW. Aim 2 (Implementation): Test the effectiveness and implementation outcomes of
enhanced versions of the iCARE interventions on: 1) HIV case-finding, linkage-to-care and PrEP uptake
among YMSM and YTW and 2) viral load suppression in previously unstudied YLH newly-diagnosed and
initiating ART. Aim 3 (Sustainment): Promote sustainment of the iCARE initiative and the implementation
science capacity development goals of PATC3H-IN by developing a sustainability plan, including economic
considerations that leverage ongoing formative research funded by an NICHD supplement, in collaboration
with youth, clinic administrators and health ministries and develop IS capacity, building on our Adolescent HIV
Prevention and Treatment Implementation Science Alliance (AHISA)-funded iTRAIN project."
10888174,"SUMMARY: Opioid use disorder and opioid overdose death rates in the United States reached unprecedented
levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how endogenous opioid activity affects natural reward
seeking is crucial to understanding the neuropharmacological basis of opioid use disorder. Previous research
implicates the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which refers to dopamine neurons projecting from the Ventral
Tegmental Area (VTA) to the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), in reward and addiction. Recent studies show that
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) containing neurons in the VTA (VTAGABA) provide local inhibition of dopamine
neurons that synapse onto the NAc, thus playing a role in regulating reward behaviors. Importantly, these
VTAGABA neurons contain a variety of G-protein coupled receptors, specifically the µ-opioid receptor (MOR).
However, the exact role of these receptors and their signaling play in VTAGABA neurons and consequent
regulation of natural reward is unknown. The source of endogenous opioid neuropeptide onto these MORs, and
how these impacts signaling and activity has not been described. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
µ-opioid receptor signaling on VTAGABA neurons is regulated by afferent endogenous opioid peptides, resulting
in disinhibition of VTAGABA neuron excitability. This results in control of dopamine neuron activity, and ultimately
the expression of natural reward-seeking. This proposal directly addresses NIDA's Priority Scientific Area 1 that
aims to further understand the molecular, neuropharmacological and circuit changes induced by drug use. Aim
1 will isolate the role of endogenous µ-opioid peptides in the VTA on dopamine signaling and natural reward-
seeking. Aim1A uses ex vivo two-photon imaging and neuropharmacology approaches to visualize VTAGABA and
VTA DA dynamics. Aim1B will investigate the effects of MOR ablation in the VTA on dopamine activity and
behavior. Aim 2 will isolate the source and dynamics of endogenous µ-opioids in the VTA during natural reward
behavior. In Aim 2A, I will use viral tracing techniques to anatomically visualize inputs from the lateral
hypothalamus (LH) to the VTA. Aim 2B will test the effects of endogenous µ-opioid signaling on VTAGABA and
DA activity in the NAc during reward seeking behaviors. In Aim 2C, I will use molecular approaches including
CRISPR gene-editing and a recently developed µ-opioid biosensor (µMASS1) to understand the spatiotemporal
aspects of MOR signaling in VTAGABA neurons during reward seeking. This career development training and
series of experiments will provide insight into the role of endogenous MOR signaling on dopaminergic activity
and natural reward-seeking. For this proposal, I will train in slice electrophysiology, two-photon slice imaging,
gene-editing, molecular neuropharmacology, and behavioral approaches to understand how specific
neuropeptides regulate reward circuits. This F31 proposal will greatly advance my career development plan and
prepare me for a career as an independent, academic neuropharmacologist."

The proper functioning of learning, memory, and cognition requires the activity-dependent strengthening of
excitatory synapses in the hippocampus via a process known as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP can be
impaired in ex vivo hippocampal slices by incubation with the peptide amyloid-β (Aβ); increased concentrations
of this peptide are highly associated with early synaptic deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive
neurodegenerative disease. LTP is known to require the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII),
and specifically its localization to excitatory synapses, driven by direct binding of CaMKII to the NMDA-type
glutamate receptor GluN2B. This localization of CaMKII to excitatory synapses is impaired by incubation with
Aβ, revealing a potential mechanism underlying Aβ-induced synaptic deficits. Interestingly, the impairments of
LTP and CaMKII movement caused by exogenous Aβ incubation are alleviated by loss of the amyloid precursor
protein (APP). While the proteolytic cleavage that APP undergoes to form Aβ is well-characterized, this apparent
downstream role as a mediator of Aβ-induced impairment remains largely unexplored. Importantly, individuals
with Down syndrome (DS), a genetic developmental disorder, express increased levels of APP due to triplication
of the APP gene. As loss of endogenous APP “desensitizes” neurons to the synaptic deficits caused by Aβ, it
may conversely be true that these increased APP levels “sensitize” neurons to the effects of Aβ. Initial results
indicate that APP is not only necessary to mediate CaMKII impairments caused by exogenous Aβ, but also
sufficient to impair CaMKII-GluN2B binding in heterologous cells, further implicating APP as a direct mediator of
downstream Aβ-induced CaMKII impairments. Thus, this proposal will investigate various aspects of APP’s role
as a mediator of Aβ, including whether neurons expressing higher levels of APP are more sensitive to Aβ-induced
synaptic impairments, which domain(s) of the APP protein are necessary to mediate these impairments, and
which specific mechanism(s) downstream of APP and Aβ are driving impairments in LTP-related CaMKII
movement. To answer these questions, we will be utilizing several different genetic mouse lines, including a
model of DS, various mutant constructs of APP, and a recently developed photoactivatable CaMKII. The results
of the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide valuable insight into the role of APP in driving synaptic
impairment (underlying hippocampal memory deficits) caused by Aβ in both AD and DS."

Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic human retrovirus affecting over 20 million people
worldwide. HTLV-1 infection can cause adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) and other serious inflammatory diseases.
Estimates report that 5-10% of HTLV-1 infected patients will develop a serious condition such as ATL, which has
poor 4-year survival and high relapse rates. HTLV-1 has persistent infection rates across the globe and reaches
up to 45% prevalence in certain communities. Despite this impact on human health, there are no direct-acting
antivirals (DAAs) or vaccines against HTLV-1. HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are from the same viral family and encode for
a homodimeric aspartyl protease crucial for cleavage of functional proteins from viral polyproteins. The activity
of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 protease is essential to their viral life cycles. The Schiffer laboratory has extensive
experience with viral protease crystallography and inhibition, especially with viral proteases for HIV-1, HCV
NS3/4A, and SARS-CoV-2 main protease. This expertise uniquely positions me to design, synthesize, and
characterize potent, resistance-thwarting protease inhibitors against HTLV-1 protease. Resistance-preventing
DAA design is essential because of the selective pressure applied during DAA treatment. An ideal and proven
strategy for developing a highly potent and resistance-preventing viral protease inhibitor is to target the active
site through rational design using the substrate envelope. The substrate envelope for HTLV-1 protease has not
been characterized and we lack a detailed understanding of the protease substrate specificity. I hypothesize that
by translating strategies from our design of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, namely characterizing HTLV-1 protease’s
substrate specificity, I can design potent and resistance-preventing DAAs for HTLV-1 protease.
Aim 1: Characterize the structural basis for HTLV-1 protease substrate specificity. HTLV-1 protease
cleaves six substrates by recognizing cleavage sites between individual proteins of the viral polyprotein. I will
investigate the molecular basis of this recognition underlying protease specificity by determining cocrystal
structures of the protease with bound substrates. The conserved volume inhabited by the substrates will define
the substrate envelope and inform inhibitor design for HTLV-1 protease. Aim 2: Rationally design, synthesize,
and characterize inhibitors of HTLV-1 protease to optimize potency. HIV-1 and HTLV-1 proteases share an
active site amino acid sequence identity of 45% and high structural similarity. Therefore, I will begin inhibitor
design by testing a selection of our in-house HIV-1 protease inhibitors, which have already shown low (1 µM) to
moderate (30 nM) potency against HTLV-1 protease. I will combine experimental inhibition assays with cocrystal
structure analysis to identify lead compounds for inhibitor design. I will leverage substrate specificity of the
protease by moving inhibitor design towards compounds that mimic the shape of substrates, leveraging the
substrate envelope (Aim 1), and the interactions between protease and substrate. I aim to produce novel, highly
potent (sub-nM) inhibitors that will be promising DAAs for further investigation against HTLV-1."
10881972,"Due in part to recent advances in screening and treatment, the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, continues to increase each year. The uptake of guideline-recommended computed tomography (CT) imaging surveillance semiannually for 2 years and annually for up to 5 years following curative-intent therapy is increasing rapidly in the U.S., despite unclear evidence regarding its benefit in reducing mortality. Furthermore, clinical trials of CT imaging surveillance have not been reported among U.S. populations with NSCLC. This gap in research is alarming and portends a low quality of evidence in clinical guidelines. Currently, no comprehensive lung cancer surveillance data source exists that catalogs real-world lung cancer surveillance utilization patterns and downstream outcomes, both of which are necessary to develop evidence-based recommendations for surveillance following curative-intent therapy. This project, Advancing Precision Lung Cancer Surveillance and Outcomes in Diverse Populations (PLUS2), will create this unique data source to study, understand, and optimize lung cancer surveillance and downstream outcomes. Building on the extant infrastructure and preliminary data from the lung cancer screening registry of the PCORI- and NCI-funded OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium, a network of community practices that serve Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, PLUS2 will leverage multilevel data from electronic health records, claims, and system-level factors for patients with early-stage NSCLC who have completed curative-intent therapy (n~27,217; median age 70) from 2012-2022 (retrospective cohort) and 2022-2025 (prospective cohort). The overarching goal of the project is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of lung cancer surveillance strategies, principally semi-annual versus annual CT surveillance, in relation to long-term outcomes among diverse patients with early-stage NSCLC within the U.S. population. By generating previously unavailable real-world data from NCI’s Lung Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) for use in validated simulation models, this proposal responds directly to calls to improve patient-centered decision-making in lung cancer surveillance candidates for whom the net benefits of surveillance are currently uncertain.

The long-term goal of this research program is to understand how genetic interaction among loci
(or ‘epistasis’) contributes to phenotypic variation. To achieve this objective, we will pursue two
parallel research trajectories. First, we will continue our ongoing work to characterize the
genetic and molecular mechanisms that cause spontaneous and induced mutations to show
different effects across genetically distinct individuals. These ‘background effects’ are important
to human health because they complicate efforts to predict, prevent, and treat disease based on
personalized genomic data. We recently used combinatorial DNA barcoding and CRISPR
interference (‘CRISPRi’) to screen thousands of protein-coding genes in yeast for background
effects in 170 progeny from a cross. With these data, we identified 815 background effects,
quantified how background effects shape the phenotypic variance in populations, and mapped a
subset of loci causing these background effects. Here, we will extend our work by
comprehensively dissecting the genetic bases of hundreds of these already identified
background effects, examining the environmental contextuality of these background effects, and
determining how certain ‘hotspot’ loci shape the effects of many different genetic perturbations.
Second, we have developed an approach for cloning segments of natural chromosomes and
assembling them into synthetic chromosomes that can replace the native chromosomes in cells.
This method opens new opportunities for characterizing epistasis without a need for mating or
meiosis. As proof-of-principle, we showed that a single chromosome could explain nearly the
entire difference in the abilities of two yeast species to grow at high temperature. Half of this
effect was due to epistasis between different chromosomal segments. Here, we will improve the
scalability, versatility, and portability of our technique, and will use it to determine how epistasis
shapes trait differences and isolation between yeast species and genera. Our two research
directions will produce detailed insights into epistasis that advance efforts to understand and
predict the relationship between genotype and phenotype."

This project will create a massive microdata resource comprising the entire population of the United States in
1950. The 1950 Census is ideal for research on aging: people who were young in 1950 can be linked to myriad
sources describing their health and well-being from mid to later adulthood, allowing a prospective view of aging.
By linking the 1950 Census to recent health surveys, administrative records, and the national death index,
investigators can pursue prospective analyses of the impact of early life conditions—including socioeconomic
status, parental education, local environment, and family structure—on later health and mortality. The database
will cover the entire population with full geographic detail, providing contextual information on childhood
neighborhood characteristics, labor-market conditions, and environmental conditions. The 1950 data will enable
transformative research to uncover the effects of early life conditions on health and well-being in later life,
including cognitive impairment. The database will make a permanent and substantial addition to the nation’s
statistical infrastructure and will have far-reaching implications for research across the social and behavioral
sciences.
The project involves (1) transcribing 8.3 billion keystrokes of data describing the demographic and economic
characteristics of all individuals, families, households, and group quarters present in the U.S. in 1950; (2)
evaluating data quality through random blind verification and comparison with published census tabulations; (3)
converting approximately ten million different open-ended census responses into numeric classifications
compatible with previous and subsequent census data; (4) data cleaning, including editing and imputation of
inconsistent and missing data values; (5) developing metadata and documentation, including full descriptions of
data processing methods, detailed analysis of comparability issues, and comprehensive machine-processable
metadata; and (6) incorporating the database into the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) data
access systems for free dissemination to the scientific community.
The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise and
experience in large-scale data creation, integration, and dissemination. The project is a collaboration with the
nation’s largest producer of genealogical data. This public-private partnership allows a highly cost-effective use
of scarce resources for shared infrastructure for population and health research."
10764251,"Genomic copy number variation (CNV) in a part of human chromosome 1 emerged recently in the
human lineage by repeated segmental duplications and rearrangements. CNVs here have been associated
with autism, schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders in multiple genome-wide association
studies. However, the gene(s) in this interval that contribute to these phenotypes have not been established.
We recently identified a family of 3 genes, ​NOTCH2NLA​, -​B and -​C that reside in this locus, are highly
expressed during early brain development and are capable of promoting cortical neuron stem cell maintenance
and proliferation. In this proposal ​we test the hypothesis that NOTCH2NL genes are required for normal
human brain development and alterations in their gene dosage contribute the neurological phenotypes
observed in patients with 1q21.1 distal deletions and duplications. This will be accomplished in Aim 1 by ​resequencing this genomic interval ​in diverse human population samples using new long genomic fragment sequencing technologies that will enable us ​to identify the NOTCH2NL alleles present in the human population ​and structural variation present in this highly repetitive genomic region​. This information will inform ​subsequent sequence analysis of 14 samples
harboring pathogenic 1q21.1 CNV events that may implicate specific NOTCH2NL loci and variants in
these disorders. This information will be used to develop ​high throughput, cost-effective assays to
identify the specific NOTCH2NL alleles present in large genomic DNA collections from patients with
1q21.1-associated neurological disorders. In Aim 2, we will ​test the activity of the various NOTCH2NL
alleles identified in 2 ways. First, examine the ability of each NOTCH2NL allele ​to promote NOTCH signaling
using reporter based assays​. Second, we will test the activity of specific NOTCH2NL alleles ​to promote
normal cortical organoid formation using isogenic CRISPR engineered pluripotent stem cell lines that
differ only by the specific NOTCH2NL alleles present. The ability of specific alleles to rescue defects in the
balance of neural stem cells and cortical neurons associated with loss of NOTCH2NL will be measured by
single-cell RNA Sequencing, bulk gene expression measurements and histology. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test
whether ​heterozygous, large-scale 1q21.1 deletions similar to those observed in patients have similar
or more severe defects in early brain development as assayed by our human pluripotent stem cell
cerebral cortex organoid assay using the analysis methods described for Aim 2. We will then ​test the ability
of NOTCH2NL and other genes in locus to rescue any defects observed. The experiments outlined here will improve our understanding of the specific biological defects resulting from 1q21.1 CNVs that ultimately lead to complex neurological disorders. These methods can be applied to other repetitive genomic loci implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases."

Astrocytes are ubiquitous CNS glial cells that make extensive contacts with neurons. Astrocytes serve diverse roles, including ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter clearance, synapse formation/removal, synaptic modulation, and contributions to neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are widely implicated in disease and in regulating animal behaviour. Astrocytes are thus critical components of neural circuits and their behavioral outputs. How astrocytes perform such varied physiological roles is a topic of intense worldwide investigation with many fascinating open questions. An exciting discovery made by us and others over the last few years is that astrocytes are heterogeneous, displaying CNS region and neural circuit-specific properties and functions. Exploring the molecular basis and function of astrocyte diversity within specific neural circuits is emerging as an important, innovative research frontier. One outstanding open task is to understand functions of molecularly defined astrocytes in specific CNS areas and to determine how they regulate neural circuits and contribute to behaviors associated with those nuclei. We address this topic for a specific population of Crym+ (protein: μ-crystallin) striatal astrocytes in relation to motor and goal-directed behavior. Interestingly, Crym is downregulated in postmortem striatal tissue in some basal ganglia diseases, implying that understanding how these astrocytes regulate neural circuits physiologically may, in the long term, inform about disease mechanisms. However, almost nothing is known physiologically about either μ-crystallin or about Crym+ striatal astrocytes in the CNS. Based on unexpected and exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that striatal astrocytes defined by Crym regulate essential astrocyte-neuron interactions within CM striatal microcircuits that control motor and goal-directed behavior. The preliminary data to support this hypothesis are compelling and new. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate how striatal astrocyte-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Crym deletion affects MSNs and astrocytes. Specific Aim 2 will study MSN activity in vivo during behavior following striatal astrocyte Crym deletion. Specific Aim 3 will explore molecular mechanisms of striatal astrocyte Crym (μ-crystallin) in relation to striatal-dependent behaviors. Completion of these aims will advance markedly our understanding of striatal astrocyte-neuron interaction mechanisms and of μ-crystallin. We believe our studies will also be paradigmatic for understanding astrocyte diversity within neural circuits and the functions that such specializations serve in relation to the striatum and the basal ganglia circuitry."

Targeting mitochondria has emerged as a key strategy for bacteria to hijack host cell physiology and
promote infection. Mitochondrial dysfunction shapes innate immune response and promotes inflammatory
responses. Several studies have shown that defective oxidative DNA damage repair pathways are associated
with mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases. Base excision repair (BER) is the
predominant pathway that corrects small base lesions caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
(RONS).
BER is the major pathway for the repair of oxidative DNA lesions and is present in both nucleus and
mitochondria by similar mechanisms that share many of the core BER enzymes. DNA polymerase beta
(POLB) and gamma (POLG) are involved in maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity. The 5’-
deoxyribophosphodiesterase (5’-dRP lyase) functions of POLB is more active than POLG 5’-dRP lyase
function to remove the 5’-dexyribose phosphate group (5’-dRP). In addition, we characterized 5’-dRP lyase
deficient POLB (L22P point mutation)] that results in loss of 5’-dRP lyase function as a model to examine
whether absence of 5’-dRP lyase impairs mitochondrial function and contributes to aberrant inflammatory
response. Our preliminary data show that BER deficient cells significantly accumulate mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) damage. Moreover, we found that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection exacerbates DNA damage
and inflammatory response in 5’-dRP lyase deficient mice. However, there are no data to explain how the BER
defect (
5’-dRP lyase deficient POLB) influences mitochondrial DNA mediated innate immune response and its
potential impact on induction of inflammation associated human diseases. In this application, we will examine
how defective BER associated mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cytosolic nucleic acid sensor mediated
innate immune inflammatory response. Based on our highly significant and encouraging preliminary findings,
we will test the hypothesis that defective BER promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and provokes
cytosolic nucleic acid mediated signaling in H. pylori associated inflammation. In this study, we propose
three specific aims as follows: i) Determine whether BER deficient cells release mtDNA in the cytoplasm; ii)
Determine whether aberrant repair of mtDNA modulates
innate immune signaling in vitro and in vivo; and iii)
Define how the effects of aberrant BER (5’-dRP lyase deficient POLB) with H. pylori infection contribute to
cytosolic nucleic acid sensor mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory response. Completion of the
proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insight into how impaired mtBER and extracellular bacterial
infection contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction related inflammation. Further, unlocking cytosolic surveillance
and signaling upon extracellular bacterial infection may reveal new opportunities for future immune based
therapeutic strategy."

 The cranial neural crest (NC) contributes to the formation of many craniofacial structures including the
bones and cartilage of the face, tooth dentin and peripheral ganglia. Cell signaling regulates different aspects
of cranial NC specification, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and differentiation and disruptions in
this developmental program results in many cranial NC-derived craniofacial birth defects including
craniosynestosis, Treacher Collins and CHARGE syndromes, and cleft palate. BMP signaling plays a crucial
role during the specification and differentiation of cranial NC, and more recently, BMP signaling was shown to
control cranial NC EMT. A mechanistic understanding of the role of BMP signaling during cranial NC
development is essential to develop novel preventative and therapeutic measures against craniofacial
defects.
 This proposal will determine the molecular mechanism of BMP gradient formation in the chick
gastrula, and how this gradient regulates the formation of cranial cell types including neural, cranial NC,
placode and epidermal fates. These experiments will use in vivo and in silico approaches to test the
hypothesis that extracellular BMP ligands are produced primarily by the cranial NC and are actively shuttled
over long distances to signal most strongly in the nonneural ectoderm. Next, quantitative expression analysis
and live imaging will be used to establish the timeline of BMP signaling during gastrulation and neurulation,
and analysis of the resulting datasets will determine population- and single-cell-level responses to BMP
signals. Differences in signal timing and strength will then be correlated with direct input into different target
genes. Finally, the role of BMP target genes Id1/2/3/4 and Fibin during cranial NC EMT will be investigated
using in vivo functional analyses. Together, the results of these aims will provide a comprehensive
understanding of the regulation and roles of BMP signaling events during early cranial NC development.
 In addition to identifying targets for translational avenues to prevent craniofacial birth defects, the
mentored phase of this proposal will provide Dr. Michael Piacentino with necessary training as he prepares to
begin his independent career. Dr. Marianne Bronner's lab at California Institute of Technology, and his
assembled advisory council, provide the necessary tools, expertise, and training environment to efficiently
execute the proposed aims and establish Dr. Piacentino's independence. This training will be instrumental as
Dr. Piacentino begins his independent research program and will provide the experience needed to make
lasting impacts on the field of BMP signaling during craniofacial development."

Basic research has fueled a revolution in how complex diseases are treated. As our understanding of T cell
activation improves, so will our ability to leverage the latest findings for translational purposes. For example,
synthetic receptors could be used to redirect T cell specificity and functions to treat numerous diseases if they
are able to integrate with a T cell’s intracellular signaling machinery in a way that mimics the native 5-module
receptor complexes that naturally drive T cell responses to peptide antigens presented by MHC molecules
[receptor module = the T cell receptor (TCR); signaling modules = CD3γε, CD3δε, CD3ζζ; coreceptor module =
CD4/CD8]. We have therefore advocated for biomimetic engineering of synthetic receptors. However, our
basic and translational work in this space, along with the basic research from other labs, have taught us that
doing so requires a better understanding of coreceptor function. At present, controversy surrounds how the
TCR-CD3 complex and CD4 work together on the outside of a CD4+ T cells to relay pMHCII-specific
information across the cell membrane. And, on the inside of CD4+ T cells, the dominant paradigm that is
thought to describe pMHCII-specific signal initiation is not supported by recent results of experiments that were
designed to directly test this model. The current proposal will therefore interrogate the molecular mechanisms,
both outside and inside of CD4+ T cells, by which CD4 contributes to pMHCII-specific responses. We will
leverage advances in computational analysis of protein evolution, and co-evolution, to guide structure-function
analysis of the putative docking site for CD4 and TCR-CD3-pMHCII units. We will also work to purify TCR-
CD3-pMHCII-CD4 assemblies for structural characterization. Finally, we will investigate the molecular
mechanisms by which motifs in CD4’s transmembrane, cytoplasmic juxtamembrane, and intracellular regions
work to help initiate and regulate pMHCII-specific responses. Our results will inform our basic understanding of
CD4+ T cell activation, and therefore guide biomimetic engineering of synthetic receptors for therapeutic
purposes."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoma, is a significant clinical problem, with only
60% of patients cured. Mechanisms for how DLBCL, an immune cancer, evades host defenses are poorly
understood. Growing evidence suggests that the human gut microbiota (GMB) plays important roles in regulating
innate and adaptive immunity, and is associated with therapeutic outcome in multiple solid tumor types. Based
on this connection, we hypothesize that the GMB influences lymphoma behavior by altering the anti-tumor
immune response. Our preliminary data provide compelling evidence that DLBCL patients: a) have distinct
GMB compositions in which many commensal families are lost; and b) show chronic activation in central and
effector memory T cells. However, the connections between GMB and lymphoma remain poorly understood,
limiting the development of targeted therapies. The overall goal of the proposed research is to investigate
longitudinally the impact of GMB signatures on clinical response and systemic immunity in DLBCL.
Thus, our specific aims are: Aim 1: To investigate in untreated DLBCL the association between the GMB and
treatment response using 16S and full metagenomic shotgun sequencing of stool samples from 300 patients
pre-treatment, during treatment, and at 12 months, a validated endpoint for clinical outcome; Aim 2: To evaluate
the potential bi-directional associations between GMB and DLBCL by tracking concurrent stool and weekly blood
samples which we will analyze with novel Bayesian timeseries methods for a subset of 50 DLBCL patients daily
during the first 14 days of treatment, and then in follow-up as in Aim 1; Aim 3: To investigate functional
relationships between immune activation and microbial diversity, including translocation of microbial products
from the gut into the blood and expansion of antigen-specific T cells directed against poor outcome microbes.
The scientific premise is supported by extensive pilot data and rigorous application of established methods.
The proposed study is highly innovative, as it will be the first large scale longitudinal and prospective
investigation of the GMB in lymphoma, using state of the art methodologies such as, full metagenomic shotgun
sequencing, AbSeq, and Bayesian time series analysis. This research has the potential to significantly advance
lymphoma research by identifying the GMB and systemic immune pathways that impact treatment failure in
DLBCL, and it may provide the biologic insights for new personalized therapeutics. We will build on our findings
to develop personalized microbial-based therapies, which could range from dietary changes that would favor
growth of organisms we demonstrate to be beneficial, to targeted probiotic therapy and/or fecal transplantation to
reduce microbes we show are deleterious. Because gut bacteria are modifiable, our findings could lead in the
future to the implementation of tailored microbial-based therapies, a new and minimally toxic treatment paradigm
for DLBCL patients, a significant unmet medical need."
10781964,"NMR-Based Rapid Fluid Assessment: Device Design and Signal Processing
PROJECT SUMMARY
Our goal is to develop a portable, non-invasive, measurement of volume status to improve quality
of life and reduce morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Maintenance of euvolemic
status and proper fluid balance are critical for health and improved outcomes for renal,
cardiovascular, and many other disease types as well as in healthy populations prone to
dehydration such as athletes and soldiers. Our laboratory has previously constructed a portable
single sided magnetic resonance (MR) sensors that is capable of resolving individual fluid
compartments (subcutaneous, intramuscular, etc.) within tissue. This sensor was used in a pilot
clinical trial with end stage kidney disease patients. Quantitative MRI results on these patients
demonstrated that the first sign of fluid overload among hemodialysis patients is an expanded
skeletal muscle extracellular fluid (ECF) space. The early stage nature of the technology was
evident in that study as the portable sensor could not unambiguously differentiate skeletal muscle
tissue from subcutaneous tissue.
 The proposed research includes the design of a new portable low-field MR sensor and
improved signal processing that will allow it to capture the same quantitative assessment of
volume status currently achievable with quantitative MRI (qMRI). We measure local fluid
distribution in the target in vivo tissue compartment. In the case of fluid volume status, our
hypothesis is that a localized skeletal muscle measurement is representative of systemic fluid
distribution based on results from a prior study1. The optimized sensor will have the sensitive
region of the magnetic field designed to target the skeletal muscle. The existing and newly
designed portable MR sensors will be used to measure intramuscular fluid distribution in end stage
kidney disease patients undergoing dialysis treatment as well as in healthy athletes experiencing
exercise induced fluid loss. The sensor measurement will allow for quantification of volume
overload (hypervolemia) or depletion (hypovolemia) and allow for its use in clinical decision
making. Dialysis patients and athletes are the target population for the following proposal. The
rapid reduction in fluid volume during a dialysis session and exercise respectively provides the
ideal clinical context for performing repeated fluid status measurements."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortality among people living with HIV, causing one in
three deaths world-wide. In southern Africa, interaction between TB and HIV epidemics has led
to increased transmission of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), critically undermining both TB and HIV-
related treatment targets. Bedaquiline (BDQ) is the first new TB drug in over 40 years, and the
World Health Organization recommends the inclusion of BDQ in DR-TB treatment allowing for
more effective, entirely oral DR-TB treatment. Despite challenges, BDQ rollout in South Africa
has been highly successful in reducing TB associated-mortality and improving cure rates.
Dolutegravir, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, formulated as part of a once-daily combination
antiretroviral therapy (ART), is newly available in the South African public health system.
Tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (TLD) is superior to older comparator regimens, protective for
discontinuation due to adverse events, and has minimal interaction with BDQ.
 The availability of TLD and BDQ has radically transformed the treatment paradigm for DR-TB
HIV but advances in dual adherence support are needed to realize the benefits of new
therapeutics for patients, and to prevent emergent resistance. Patient-centered adherence
support strategies using psychosocial support and mHealth (health practices supported by mobile
technologies) approaches may improve DR-TB HIV outcomes.
 The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate an integrated intervention to enhance adherence
to BDQ and TLD. Using a Bayesian, adaptive randomized trial design, this project will efficiently
evaluate the relative contribution of psychosocial support and cellular-supported mHealth
adherence support, in combination and separately, to improve clinical and biological outcomes
for HIV and TB. BDQ adherence measured using cellular-enabled electronic pill boxes, will allow
us to determine optimal adherence thresholds associated with TB culture conversion. We will
use a model-based approach to characterize socio-behavioral mechanisms of action for the
different intervention arms (including potential non-response), and modifiable factors that present
barriers and facilitators to adherence. We will also evaluate the effect of DR-TB HIV intersectional
stigma on adherence. Qualitative methods will allow for longitudinal description of patient-
centered treatment pathways.
 Once completed, this study will meet the expressed need of the South African health system
for evidence-based DR-TB HIV adherence interventions and contribute generalizable knowledge
about the relative contributions of adherence support modalities in medically complex patients."

Smoking tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable mortality in adults worldwide. However, there is
currently a lack of pharmacological smoking cessation aids and their efficacy is limited. Therefore, there is an
urgent need to better understand the neural mechanisms that underlie nicotine addiction for the development of
novel smoking cessation treatments. Much of our understanding of the reinforcing effects of nicotine are derived
from studies focused on canonical mesolimbic dopamine reward circuitry in the brain. Research suggests that
the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway consisting of the medial habenula (MHb) and interpeduncular nucleus
(IPN) contributes to the aversive motivational properties of high nicotine doses. It is speculated that activation of
nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) stimulates excitatory acetylcholine/glutamate (ACh/Glu) co-releasing
projection neurons which activate ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the IPN. However, silencing IPN
neurons in rodent models has also been shown to reduce nicotine consumption and reward. Thus, it is possible
that modulation of MHb→IPN circuit activity may contribute to the balance of nicotine reward and aversion, a
critical component of nicotine addiction liability. However, it is unknown how MHb→IPN neurons respond to
nicotine within the context of reward related behavior. It is also unclear whether nicotine-induced activation of
this circuit is necessary to elicit nicotine’s aversive properties. In the proposed project, I aim to test the hypothesis
that modulation of IPN GABAergic neuron activity by nicotine is critical for balancing nicotine reward/aversion. I
also aim to test the hypothesis that nicotine-induced control of ACh/Glu projection neuron activity from the MHb
to IPN controls nicotine reward/aversion balance. Thus, I will assess the influence of rewarding or aversive
nicotine doses on MHb or IPN neural activity during the performance of conditioned place preference/conditioned
place aversion (CPP/CPA) procedures using in vivo fiber photometry combined with genetically encoded calcium
indicators (GCaMPs). Finally, I will use in vivo optogenetics to selectively activate or silence MHb or IPN neurons
to investigate whether specific components of this circuit are sufficient to drive nicotine reward/aversion balance.
The goal of this project is to provide a better understanding of circuit-specific mechanisms that may contribute
to nicotine reward/aversion balance, which will aid in the development of precise pharmacological treatments for
smoking cessation."

The development of central nervous system (CNS) drugs requires imaging tools that can
quantify drug efficacy and target engagement as well as the effects of drug concentration on
these quantitative assessment measures. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has
become standard practice for quantitative assessment, thanks to its ability to image tracers that
bind to target receptors of drugs. Receptor occupancy (RO) studies, which consist in a pair of
PET scans, baseline and post-drug injection, can be used to quantify, as a function of drug
concentration, the blocking effect of a drug. The concentration yielding half-maximum blocking
effect, called EC50, is determined by first estimating receptor occupancy for each pair of scans,
then fitting a logistic model to the occupancy vs. concentration curve. The conventional method
to estimate RO and EC50 consists in reconstructing the dynamic PET data for each pair of
scans, perform kinetic fitting, typically in high binding regions, to estimate the binding potential
and calculate RO, before performing the logistic fit across concentrations to obtain EC50. The
resulting estimates have low precision due to the noise in dynamic PET images and the lack of
proper noise modeling. Moreover, estimating single RO and EC50 values discards potentially
valuable information on the spatial distribution of RO and EC50. We propose an estimation
framework that jointly estimates spatial RO maps for each pair of scans and a global EC50 map
using an end-to-end model from the PET measurements to the estimated EC50. The estimation
framework relies on advanced optimization strategies to decompose the joint estimation process
into manageable subproblems, such as image reconstruction, parametric fitting, image
denoising and logistic fitting. The method is expected to improve the estimation of RO and EC50
over conventional methods, while offering additional spatial information. The targeted
improvement in estimation would allow to reduce the sample size required in drug trials to
achieve the same statistical power as conventional approaches (or conversely, increase the
statistical power for a fixed sample size). The method will be validated in numerical simulations
and applied to in vivo animal studies."

Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS)/ Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a chronic pelvic pain disorder characterized by suprapubic, pelvic pain with at least one urinary symptom. Stress exacerbates symptoms of BPS/IC. Despite intense research, we lack understanding of how structural and functional changes in the micturition reflex are linked to BPS/IC and how stress exacerbates symptoms, thus impeding effective therapies. Expanding upon our previous collaborations, integrating our diverse scientific disciplines, and combining our unique laboratory strengths, we will use a repeated variate stress (RVS) and cyclophosphamide (CYP) injury/inflammation models to test the overall hypothesis that increases in urinary frequency and pelvic pain responses from stress- and injury-induced changes in central micturition and peripheral sensory circuits, respectively, reflect PACAP/PAC1 receptor-mediated signaling and neuroplasticity to engender a pro-excitatory state. Building from our previous work, we will assess how maladaptive intersections between the PACAP/PAC1R pathways may be contributory to stress-induced urinary bladder dysfunction and pelvic pain. Aim 1: To test whether RVS, in the absence of direct urinary bladder insults, induces changes in micturition reflexes that are associated with PACAP/PAC1R neurochemical plasticity in central neural circuits. Hypothesis: Our previous studies have demonstrated neuropeptide phenotypic plasticity, including changes in PACAP/PAC1R expression after stress challenges. Coordinate with these responses, we anticipate that RVS and CYP challenges will similarly result in central micturition pathway PACAP/PAC1R plasticity to alter voiding and pain responses. These studies are significant in the: (1) mechanistic insight gained of underlying structural and functional changes contributory to stress- and injury/inflammation-induced changes in voiding behavior and pelvic pain; (2) influence of psychological stress on central circuits underlying bladder function and pelvic sensation and (3) identification PACAP/PAC1 receptor-mediated signaling as a novel target for stress- and injury/inflammation-induced urinary bladder dysfunction and pelvic pain."

The rapid emergence of innovative technologies, therapeutics, and other FDA-regulated products have outpaced
the ability to effectively appropriate them for public benefit. Doing so hinges on the capability to expeditiously
evaluate these products and effectively monitor them once on the market. However, methodologies for pre-
market evaluation through laboratory testing and clinical trials for drugs, devices, and biologics and for post-
marketing surveillance of all FDA-regulated products have not kept pace, and key gaps in knowledge exist that
would inform regulatory decision making in many areas. In the face of these pressing needs, the Research
Triangle Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (Triangle CERSI) will provide a one-stop-

11175913,"ABSTRACT
The rapid emergence of innovative technologies, therapeutics, and other FDA-regulated products have outpaced
the ability to effectively appropriate them for public benefit. Doing so hinges on the capability to expeditiously
evaluate these products and effectively monitor them once on the market. However, methodologies for pre-
market evaluation through laboratory testing and clinical trials for drugs, devices, and biologics and for post-
marketing surveillance of all FDA-regulated products have not kept pace, and key gaps in knowledge exist that
would inform regulatory decision making in many areas. In the face of these pressing needs, the Research
Triangle Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (Triangle CERSI) will provide a one-stop-
shop accelerator to meet FDA’s current and evolving needs in regulatory science and a generative community
for regulators, academia, industry, and other stakeholders. A collaboration of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, Duke University, North Carolina State University, and North Carolina Central University, all in close
proximity, the Triangle CERSI represents a broad network of investigators and national and international
collaborators that bring unique and diverse expertise and resources for regulatory science, including but not
limited to novel approaches in statistical methodologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence, imaging, in
silico trials, pediatric pharmacology, patient reported outcomes (PRO), population science, and safety
assessment across the lifespan, and other areas. The Triangle CERSI includes two Schools of Medicine, a
School of Pharmacy, two Schools of Nursing, a School of Public Health, a College of Veterinary Medicine, a
leading historically Black university, a national Center for Virtual Imaging Trials, and the Duke Clinical Research
Institute, and leverages relationships with nearby companies and organizations in the Research Triangle Park.
The Triangle CERSI has three specific aims: 1. Conduct regulatory science projects in collaboration with FDA to
deliver major advances in regulatory science and rapidly address a broad range of major, specific, and emerging
challenges in response to FDA needs. 2. Establish robust CERSI Core infrastructure to develop, propose,
support, enable, and monitor execution of CERSI research projects to facilitate rapid achievement of project
deliverables; partner Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides support for data access, computation, and
resource sharing. 3. Expand support of the Triangle CERSI and extend its impact through regulatory science
information sharing activities, including efforts to diversify the regulatory science workforce. The Triangle CERSI
will actively share results and newly developed tools and resources with the FDA, research community,
stakeholders, and our institutions’ students and trainees. Together, our overarching goal is to provide an
abundance of essential new information, infrastructure, and tools to shorten the drug and device development
process, to advance public health, and to inform FDA activities in ways that complement other CERSIs and

10757396,"The efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) behavioral cancer pain intervention designed to decrease pain and
disability for breast cancer patients in medically underserved areas has not been investigated. The long-term
goal of this work is to use mHealth technologies to facilitate wide-spread implementation of an efficacious
behavioral cancer pain intervention – a non-pharmacological approach to pain management. The proposed
project’s objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of an innovative mobile health Pain Coping Skills Training
(mPCST-Community) designed to meet the needs of breast cancer patients with pain in medically underserved
areas. mPCST-Community addresses intervention barriers for patients in medically underserved areas as it is
delivered with video-conferencing in the patients’ community based oncology clinic by a remote therapist, is
extended to the patients’ home environment using simple mHealth technology, and is low-literacy adapted. The
central hypothesis is that mPCST-Community will result in decreased pain compared to a mHealth education
attention control group (mHealth-Ed). The rationale of this proposal is that if mPCST-Community is shown to be
efficacious it will rapidly increase intervention access for individuals who receive their oncology care in medically
underserved areas and ultimately reduce pain-related suffering. Guided by strong preliminary data, a randomized
controlled trial will be used to pursue three specific aims: 1) Test the extent to which the mPCST-Community
intervention reduces pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, 2) Examine self-efficacy and pain catastrophizing as
mediators through which the mPCST-Community leads to reductions in pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, and
3) To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mPCST-Community. For Aim 1, based on the study team’s extensive
work demonstrating the efficacy of in-person pain coping skills training protocols and pilot work showing promise
for mPCST-Community, it is expected that mPCST-Community will lead to decreased pain as well as fatigue,
disability, and distress compared to mHealth-Ed. For Aim 2, it is expected that the effects of mPCST-Community
will be mediated by increased self-efficacy for pain control and decreased pain catastrophizing. For Aim 3, it is
expected that mPCST-Community will demonstrate cost-effectiveness as assessed by all-cause medical
resource use, participant and therapist time, and health utilities as well as successful overall accrual, high subject
retention, and high intervention adherence. This innovative application proposes the first study to examine the
efficacy of mPCST-Community that is designed to address pain in cancer patients in medically underserved
areas. While improving access to care is critical, providing efficacious care is just as important. If mPCST-
Community is shown to be efficacious, it will provide an intervention that can be rapidly implemented into the
care of cancer patients with pain. Importantly, if efficacious this intervention could provide a needed model for
non-pharmacological approaches to pain management for other populations of patients with chronic pain."

Full Research Project 1 – Genomic Testing
Testing the Efficacy of an eHealth Decision Support Tool to Help Latinx Cancer Patients Make Informed
 Decisions About Tumor Genomic Testing
TU FCCC: Sarah Bauerle Bass, PhD, MPH (Co-Leader) and Michael Hall, MD, MS (Co-Leader)
HC: Tracey A. Revenson, PhD (Co-Leader) and Ana F. Abraído-Lanza, PhD (Latinx Culture Leader)
The use of tumor genomic profiling (TGP) to identify potential cancer treatments can also identify secondary
hereditary risks the patient was unaware of. ASCO policy mandates communication of TGP risks and elicit patient
preferences for managing these types of results. Latinx patients have increased cancer risk and mortality but are
especially vulnerable to barriers that would impede optimal decision making about secondary genetic risks,
including language and acculturation barriers, access and affordability, deportation risks, medical mistrust and low
genetic knowledge. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an electronic health (eHealth)
decision support tool (DST) to increase informed decision making among Latinx patients. This proposal builds on
current RCT results of testing an eHealth DST called Gene Pilot with Black cancer patients and formative work
with Latinx patients funded by the pilot mechanism of the current U54 Partnership. These studies use innovative
commercial marketing methods to address TGP concerns, promote informed decision making, and increase
communication with providers about preferences for secondary genetic information. Grounded in the Ottawa
Framework, the study will determine the efficacy of a revised DST, Gene PilotLX, compared to traditional decision
support. Specific aims are: 1. Revise the Gene Pilot DST to reflect formative work with Latinx cancer patients to
incorporate specific cultural values and language needs. We will use formative results and establish Community
and Scientific Advisory Boards to revise content to make it culturally-anchored. We will then conduct user testing
with 25 Latinx cancer patients; 2. Test the impact of Gene PilotLX in a randomized trial. We will conduct a fully
powered RCT with 232 Latinx cancer patients at four oncology sites. Intervention participants will have access to
Gene PilotLX via a tablet or personal device; the comparison arm will receive non-targeted education materials
about TGP. Primary outcomes include decision preparedness, decisional conflict, and communication of
preferences with a doctor. Secondary outcomes include communication of preferences with family and changes in
perceptions of TGP. H1: Those in the Gene PilotLX arm will have greater reduced decisional conflict and higher
decision preparedness compared to the non-targeted decision aid. H2: Those in the Gene PilotLX arm will report
communicating TGP preferences with their oncologist more when compared to the non-targeted information arm;
and 3. Determine whether the effects of Gene PilotLX on primary and secondary outcomes are moderated by
Latinx cultural values and acculturation. H3: Gene PilotLX will have a larger effect on primary outcomes for those
holding stronger values of familismo and those who are more acculturated than those with lower values. The
reverse will occur with the Latinx value of fatalismo. Break Systemic Barriers to Inclusion: In line with the U54’s
Inclusive Excellence vision, this study addresses systemic barriers by focusing on Latinx-specific challenges to
engaging and communicating about TGP, thereby reducing potential cancer health disparities by improving
informed decision making in an under-studied population at high risk of cancer."

Full Research Project 2 – Colon Cancer
Changes in DNA methylation phenotype in CRC associated with racial disparities
TUFCCC: Carmen Sapienza, PhD (Co-Leader) and Jayashri Ghosh, PhD (Co-Leader, ESI)
 HC: Frida E. Kleiman, PhD (Co-Leader)
Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher in African Americans (AA)
compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). Current non-invasive screening tools, such as fecal occult blood tests
(FOBT) or fecal DNA markers, detect cancer after it occurs. More effective tools for prevention and treatment of
higher risk individuals, such as colonoscopy or endoscopy, are invasive, less popular and subjective, and current
uptake of these screening tools is lower among AA compared to CA. Therefore, identification of early and
objective biomarkers that distinguish normal colon mucosa of individuals at high risk for CRC from individuals at
low risk might decrease racial disparities in CRC. In our previous U54 Pilot project (Cycle 1), we have identified
a subgroup of patients having highly disrupted epigenomes displaying abnormal DNA methylation patterns in
their normal mucosa, identified as “Outlier Methylation Phenotype” (OMP). We have been able to significantly
associate this phenotype with CRC patients over healthy controls. Furthermore, AA CRC patients appear more
than twice as likely as CA patients to have OMP. In the current cycle, we propose to determine the prevalence
of OMPs in a larger group of patients in Specific Aim 1A, both AA (150 CRC and 200 controls) and CA (150 CRC
and 200 Controls). In Specific Aim 1B, we will elucidate biological mechanisms for the contribution of OMP to
CRC tumorigenesis using patient derived organoids (PDO). In Specific Aim 2, we will also determine whether
OMP - affected genes in AA patients are enriched in Black/Ancestry-informative genetic variants. In Specific Aim
3, we will determine whether environmental factors and social determinants influence the frequency of OMP in
AA groups. Break Systemic Barriers to Inclusion: Our Hunter College/Temple/Fox Chase interdisciplinary
team of bench scientists, clinicians and community outreach scientists is in a unique position to reduce systemic
barriers that lead to underrepresentation of the AA population in epigenetic research studies. This project
addresses data gaps by including AAs in the epigenetic studies and by developing quantitative and less invasive
screening tests that will potentially enable AAs to increase the uptake of CRC screening, and reduce colon
cancer disparities."
10757398,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alport Syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in collagen type IV, a main component of the
glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Podocytes are key components of the glomerular filtration barrier, and
their interaction with the GBM is crucial to maintain the permeability of this barrier. We have demonstrated that
pathogenic renal lipid accumulation occurs in an experimental model of AS and that podocyte lipotoxicity is the
key determinant of podocyte injury in other glomerular disease. My preliminary data show that the intracellular
triglyceride (TG) content is increased in glomeruli of Col4a3 KO mice, a mouse model for AS as well as in
immortalized podocytes which I established from these mice (AS podocytes). Yet, the detailed mechanism by
which lipid accumulation contributes to podocyte lipotoxicity in AS remains to be elucidated.
The proposed research will explore a novel mechanism linking PLIN5 deficiency to podocyte lipotoxicity.
PLIN5 is a protein controls lipolysis and regulates free fatty acid (FFA) flux from lipid droplets (LDs) to
mitochondrial by establishing physical contact between these organelles. From my preliminary data, I generated
the hypothesis that PLIN5 deficiency in AS causes excessive TG lipolysis and loss of LD-mitochondrial
contacts resulting in FFA accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction.
I propose the following specific aims using innovative cell biological, imaging analysis, and mouse model
approaches: (SA1) investigate the role of podocyte PLIN5 in recruiting LDs to mitochondria. (SA2) Define the
contribution of PLIN5 deficiency to mitochondrial dysfunction and renal failure in AS.
I have created a comprehensive career development plan supported by my mentor and co-mentors to
(1) ensure my progress and success in carrying out this research proposal and (2) to facilitate my
transition to an independent research career focused on lipid metabolism in association with
mitochondrial function in Alport Syndrome. This plan includes (1) regular meetings with my mentor, co-
mentors, and advisory committee, (national and global academic readers in medicine and science) to provide
research and career guidance, (2) research and career development seminars, learning new methodologies of
microscopy, mitochondrial function, and lipidomics, and (3) activities for career growth including mentoring,
publication, presentation, and application for independent research funding. My mentor and I have also agreed
upon a transition plan to distinguish myself from my mentor’s laboratory. My training will be carried out in an
unparalleled academic environment at University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, which provides dedicated
career development programs and all necessary research support and supplies through his mentor, co-mentors,
and institutional core services. Collectively, this research and career development proposal is a product of
my ambition and capacity to transition to an independent research career."
10757399,"Myofibrils located at the periphery of the muscle cell are attached to the sarcolemma via costameres, muscle-
specific integrin adhesion complexes (IACs), that transmit the force of muscle contraction to the outside of the
cell. IACs consist of the transmembrane protein integrin and hundreds of proteins in a complex both in the
ECM and especially intracellularly. Although much is known about the composition of IACs and mechanisms
that initiate their assembly, we do not know how the composition of an IAC is determined, and what determines
where an IAC will form. We exploit the conservation of muscle structure/function and the power of genetics in
C. elegans. From a genetic screen, we identified a gene, pix-1, which is required for the formation of IACs at
muscle cell boundaries (MCBs), but not the other IACs (M-lines and dense bodies). PIX-1 is the nematode
ortholog of human b-PIX, which contains a RhoGEF domain known to be an activator of Rac1 and Cdc42. pix-
1 mutants show decreased whole animal locomotion. As compared to wild type, a pix-1 null mutant, shows
50% reduction in the level of activated (GTP bound) Rac in muscle. In addition to deficiency of PIX-1,
overexpression of wild type PIX-1 protein results in decreased locomotion and disrupted MCBs. PIX-1 localizes
to all 3 IACs in muscle—M-lines, dense bodies and MCBs. Loss of function mutants in each of the known PIX
pathway proteins (PIX, Rac, GIT) result in disrupted MCBs. The protein kinase activity of PAK-1 is essential for
its MCB function: a kinase-dead PAK-1 mutant has disrupted MCBs. Although PIX proteins are known to be
important in several cell types in mammals and nematodes, our results are the first to demonstrate that a PIX
protein is required for assembly of an IAC, and is required in striated muscle. A GAP protein (inactivates Rac)
for this pathway has not been reported for any cell type or organism, but we now have two candidate GAPs.
Remarkably, we found that heart specific knockout of the mouse ortholog b-PIX results in dilated
cardiomyopathy at 8 months of age. Similarly, heart-specific knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog, dPix, also
results in cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that PIX proteins, through their RacGEF activity, direct assembly
of IACs by activating PAK kinases to phosphorylate key substrate(s) in muscle. We will leverage the unique
advantages of 3 model systems to learn new conserved functions of the PIX pathway in striated and cardiac
muscle. Aim 1: Exploiting the power of studying muscle in C. elegans we will: (a) identify the GAP protein(s);
(b) determine the localization, function and substrates of PAK kinases, and (c) test the hypothesis that PIX-1 is
only required at MCBs because there are additional RacGEF proteins at the other IAC locations. Aim 2: We
will determine how b-PIX functions in the mouse heart and how its absence leads to cardiomyopathy. Aim 3:
We will take advantage of the power of genetic modifier screens in Drosophila to identify new members of the
PIX pathway in muscle, and more specifically, cardiac muscle. There is a need to identify additional
cardiomyopathy genes in humans and genes encoding members of the PIX pathway may be new candidates."

 This proposal seeks to create a pre-doctoral training program “Arkansas Center for Health Disparities T32
Pre-doctoral Research Training Program” (ARCHD-T32) in the Department of Health Policy and Management
at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The program builds on the research infrastructure
of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) funded Arkansas Center for Health
Disparities (ARCHD) Center of Excellence and five social science PhD programs across the College of Public
Health, the College of Pharmacy, and the College of Nursing with support from the Department of Biomedical
Informatics in the College of Medicine. ARCHD-T32 provides a formal structure for integrating advanced
analytics into social science programs through didactic and applied settings with a focus on reducing health
disparities and improving health equity consistent with the priorities of NIMHD. ARCHD-T32 participants will
benefit from the ARCHD COE as it provides funding for two research projects, pilot funds for new investigators,
and community-engaged research infrastructure. ARCHD-T32 leverages the unique data assets of the UAMS
data warehouse, external partners, and the Arkansas All Payer Claims Database to address three specific
aims: 1) Create a formal structure for training social scientists in disparities/health equity research using
advanced data analytics and a team science approach; 2) Develop formal externship programs with key
partners in the state; and 3) Collaborate with the ARCHD, the Translational Research Institute, Regional
Programs, the newly formed Institute for Digital Health and Innovation at UAMS and the Institute for Advanced
Data Analytics at the University of Arkansas, as well as other national programs. A formal organizational
structure including a Multiple Program Director plan that combines expertise from the social sciences,
analytics, biostatistics, and informatics is proposed to meet five primary objectives: to recruit a diverse group of
trainees with quantitative backgrounds/capabilities and an interest in disparities research; to develop a high-
quality, individualized training program in advanced analytics directed at identifying and eliminating healthcare
disparities; to increase the workforce in Arkansas and the nation that has advanced analytics capabilities and
can contribute to identifying and eliminating healthcare disparities; to foster a training environment based on
interdisciplinary expertise and team science that responds to community needs; to evaluate the breadth of the
training program with respect to the overarching goal of creating a diverse training program that meets the
needs of the state and the nation. Support is requested to create four cohorts of two predoctoral students with
two-year training commitments. With technical and financial resources from UAMS and state partners, the
proposed training program serves as a national model for addressing health equity using advanced analytics in
an environment with pronounced health disparities."

The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) is to provide a 5-year
training pathway for Anthony Orvedahl, MD, PhD, to become an independent investigator. Dr. Orvedahl obtained
the MD, PhD degree in the Medical Scientist Training Program at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, where
he studied the role of autophagy in innate antiviral immunity. After training in Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases
at St. Louis Children's Hospital/ Washington University, he joined the lab of Herbert “Skip” Virgin, MD, PhD, who
is a renowned expert in antiviral immunity. Gary Silverman, MD, PhD, who will serve as the primary Co-Mentor,
is a practicing physician-scientist in Neonatology with recognized expertise in mechanisms of cell death. In his
preliminary work using genome-wide CRISPR screening, Dr. Orvedahl identified an important role for autophagy
genes (including Atg5) in regulating IFNγ-induced cell death. A suppressor CRISPR screen on an Atg5-deficient
background revealed the TNF pathway as a mediator of the hypersensitivity to cell death. However, TNF was
insufficient on its own to trigger cell death, which indicated one or more additional IFNγ-induced factors contribute
to TNF-induced death. Preliminary work suggests that one of these factors is the IFNγ-induced mitochondrial
enzyme, immune regulated gene 1 (IRG1). Importantly, mice with myeloid cell-specific autophagy gene-
deficiency exhibited markedly decreased survival in a TNF-induced model of shock. However, the specific type
of cell death induced by IFNγ in combination with TNF, the mechanism of IRG1 and its enzymatic product
itaconate, and the in vivo role of these factors during TNF-induced shock remain unclear. The proposed studies
to address these questions in this K08 will require in-depth analyses of cell death and mitochondrial homeostasis
using multiple microscopic, flow cytometric, and biochemical techniques. Washington University School of
Medicine provides an ideal environment to pursue the training plan outlined in this proposal. The Department of
Pediatrics has a longstanding commitment and track record of training independent physician-scientists. Dr.
Orvedahl has established successful collaborations related to this project, and interacts frequently with
investigators in the departments of Pediatrics and Pathology/ Immunology. An oversight committee has been
formed that includes advisors with expertise in immunometabolism, autophagy in intestinal inflammation, protein
biochemistry, and macrophage immune responses. The training plan incorporates technical workshops, as well
as formal coursework on grantsmanship, which will facilitate transition to independence towards the end of the
award period. The combination of mentorship, institutional resources, and focused training activities offer an
unparalleled opportunity to achieve the goals of this proposal. The immediate research goals described herein
are to: 1) investigate the mechanism of autophagy in protection against cytokine-induced macrophage cell death;
2) evaluate the role of a novel factor, IRG1, that links mitochondria to the mechanism of cell death; and 3) apply
these findings in vivo to a model of fatal TNF-induced shock."
10762439,"Nearly 25% of Americans age 65+ report serious mobility problems. Mobility impairments decrease quality of life and predict increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. However, the contribution of age-related brain changes to mobility impairments is not well understood. F99 work will examine how cortical inhibitory function relates to gait and balance declines with aging. K00 work will examine the same questions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test exercise as an intervention to improve cortical inhibitory function.  The sponsor's (Dr. Rachael Seidler) past work supports the novel hypothesis that declines in cortical inhibitory processes at least partially underlie motor impairments with aging. For Aim 1 (F99), the candidate is collecting two measures of lower limb cortical inhibition in 30 young and 30 older adults: 1) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 2) transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced cortical silent period. GABA-edited MRS provides a measure of GABA neurotransmitter concentration, while cortical silent periods provide a measure of functional cortical inhibition during muscle activity. The F99 work addresses whether these two measures of cortical inhibition are reduced in older age (Aim 1a) and whether cortical inhibition relates to individual differences in gait (Aim 1b) and balance (Aim 1c).  Mobility is often more impaired in MCI than in healthy aging. Motor symptoms typically arise much earlier than cognitive symptoms, and presence of motor symptoms relates to higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. Past work suggests that cortical inhibitory function is impaired in MCI and dementia, supporting that changes in cortical inhibition could be a component of MCI. Thus, for Aim 2 (K00), the candidate will work with Dr. Kirk Erickson to test whether cortical inhibition is reduced in MCI compared to healthy aging (Aim 2a) and if cortical inhibition relates to gait and balance in MCI (Aim 2b). Given relationships between cortical inhibition and motor control in healthy adults, it is feasible that cortical inhibition changes could also relate to mobility declines in MCI. Understanding neurotransmitter systems involved in mobility declines is important for development of interventions. Thus, the candidate will test whether aerobic exercise influences cortical inhibition in aging and MCI (Aim 2c). Past work demonstrated effects of exercise on cortical inhibition in young adults, but this has yet to be tested in aging or MCI.  This work directly contributes to the NIA's major goals of preserving mobility in aging and studying brain changes with MCI. To successfully complete these aims, the candidate will receive extensive training from an expert mentorship team in biomechanics, brain imaging, brain stimulation, MCI, and exercise intervention work. This training will provide the candidate with a comprehensive toolkit to succeed as an aging researcher, with my future independent research program focused on: 1) determining the brain changes that contribute to motor declines in older age and MCI, and 2) identifying interventions to preserve motor function in older age and MCI."
11076391,"Project Summary
Our goal is to develop a novel, immunological-directed L. lactis probiotic-based therapeutic for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder affecting up to 1% of the US
population1, 2. While many organs are affected in RA, the synovial joints are primarily afflicted with debilitating
inflammation. Approximately half of all RA patients become disabled as the disease progresses.
Treatment of RA remains a significant unmet medical need. Despite highly effective therapies targeting
cytokines and immune cells, no therapy can induce long-term disease remission38. TNF-α antagonists can
effectively diminish inflammation and attenuate destruction of cartilage and bone7-10. However, some patients
either fail to respond to, or relapse with, anti-TNF therapy. Prolonged treatment can make patients susceptible
to cancer and opportunistic infections11-14. Moreover, many current treatments for RA, no matter how effective,
consign patients to a lifetime of costly biologic therapies with attendant risks for iatrogenic complications. For
these reasons, we are developing an oral immunotherapy that regulates auto-Ag-specific regulatory T cells
(Tregs) to provide bystander tolerance. The two main goals of this approach are: 1) to “switch off” the immune
response against the host’s own tissues and 2) balance the effector cell relationships to prevent relapses of
chronic inflammation.
Originally conceived as a human diarrheal vaccine, we discovered that colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) from
human enterotoxigenic E. coli is effective at inducing auto-Ag-specific Tregs when administered orally22, 56-58. To
avoid challenges associated with producing large quantities of CFA/I protein and improve the mucosal
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of CFA/I following oral administration, we
developed an L. lactis-CFA/I expressing product (referred to as R-2487) and validated its efficacy in multiple
autoimmune models. R-2487 was effective at reducing arthritis symptoms in animal model studies, along with
experimental models of Sjögren’s syndrome, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis17, 30, 59, 60. Prior SBIR and Seed
investment funding and an FDA pre-IND meeting has enabled us to position R-2487 ready for clinical testing.
This Fast Track application is focused on obtaining human validation for R-2487 by completing a first-in-human
Phase 1 RA proof-of-concept clinical trial. The Specific Aims are: 1) finalize R-2487 clinical supply packaging, 2)
prepare and file an IND with the FDA, 3) complete a Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial, 4) analyze patient
samples before/after dosing to evaluate pharmacodynamic changes and biomarkers, 5) perform Phase 2 clinical
manufacturing scale up development to ready R-2487 for larger confirmatory trial.
Successful commercialization of R-2487 will provide a profound medical advancement for treating RA."

The goal of Administrative Core is to ensure continuity of the strong and productive ongoing partnership between
BCM and TSU to enhance cancer research and education capacity at both BCM and TSU while promoting the
diversity of the cancer research workforce. This is to be accomplished through activities such as administrative
oversight, operational support, communications, as well as regulatory and financial oversight. The two objectives
of Administrative Core are: (1) To provide integrated administrative support, promote recruitment and increase
diversity: The pilot projects and cores will benefit from centralized activities regarding budgetary activity, including
dispensing monies, overseeing budgets, generating interim and final financial reports and resolving disputes. In
addition, the administrative core with input from the IAC will use the discretionary funds it receives each year to
support new pilot projects in both institutions. It will collaborate with the Education core (C-REP) to promote
sustainable cancer research and education capacity in P20 program. It will also facilitate C-REP to develop
systematic curriculum and educational research programs between the institutions. It will conduct planning and
evaluation of the P20 partnership, ensure the partnership follows NIH policies and guidelines and submit the
annual financial and scientific reports to the IAC, EAC and NIH. (2) To provide scientific oversight and promote
collaborations: The core will provide scientific oversight by arranging internal meetings of investigators,
assessing research progress, and providing project management support to ensure that milestones are
accomplished in a timely manner. It will also coordinate internal and external advisory committee meetings and
implement the recommendations received. It will ensure frequent interactions and promote collaborations
between members of both the institutions by conducting regular seminars and monthly meetings. It will work with
institutional leaders to promote recruitment of new workforce to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). We
expect this BCU-TSU P20 CURED program will evolve to be a highly collaborative, systematic and sustainable
partnership between the two institutions that synergizes strengths of faculty and students in cancer research,
education and community outreach."

addition, it will provide bioinformatics, statistical and methodological support for all the cancer research projects
proposed, as well as future projects that will build upon them and disseminate to all CaRE2 Center members and
the scientific community at large in a timely fashion. We will reach these goals through three aims: First, we will
provide bioinformatics, statistical and methodological support. This first aim established the job scheduling and
interfaces to meet the needs of all CaRE2 Health Equity Center investigators. We will support bioinformatics and
statistical issues across the projects and cores. Bioinformatics support will include in-depth quality control and
assessment of all high-throughput sequencing data from multiple platforms and facilitate access to publicly
available datasets. Statistical and methodological support will consist of all aspects, from collecting to state-of-
the-art data analysis and interpretation and abstract, manuscript, and grant preparation. The second aim will be
enhancing and maintaining a federated data repository resource that enables the interaction of CaRE2 members.
This second aim ensures that all data are of high quality and disseminated to all CaRE2 Center members and
the scientific community promptly. In the third aim, we will provide bioinformatics, statistical and methodological
support, and educational opportunities to the CaRE2 Center. This third aim focuses on developing online
educational materials that BSMC's members and guest experts will present through the core events, such as
seminar series and interactive lectures among all CaRE2 Center members."
10932250,"ABSTRACT – Pilot Project 5
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies and the survival
rate remains stagnant with a 5-year survival rate of only 5-8%. Black/African Americans (B/AA) individuals
experience the highest prevalence and lowest overall survival rates of PDAC compared to their White
counterparts. FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) is often the preferred
chemotherapy treatment choice for patients with PDAC, but considerable toxicities have limited its use. The
decreased expression of nucleoside transporters due to genetic and epigenetic reasons appeared to account for
Gem resistance. In addition, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which is responsible for Gem phosphorylation into the
active form, is postulated to correlate with Gem efficacy. To address these challenges, we have modified Gem
to 4-(N)- stearoylGem (4NSG) to: i) block the CDA attack on Gem, and ii) increase Gem transport into PDAC
cells. Our recent results revealed highly expressed epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in pancreatic
tumor samples. Guided by our recently published and unpublished results, we hypothesize that optimized 4NSG
nanoparticles with surface-modified anti-EGFR antibody (4NSGnpcetu) will improve the therapeutic efficacy of
Gem. We propose the following specific aims to address this hypothesis. Aim 1: Test the efficacy of 4NSGnpcetu,
in B/AA, and White patient-derived organoid models (PDOs) with stroma and in primary PDAC cells. Aim 2:
Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 4NSGnpcetu in PDAC PDX mouse models bearing subcutaneous tumors from
B/AA and White patients. Aim 3: Measure dCK RNA/protein expression in PDAC PDX tumor models and SNP
genotypes in PDAC cases and controls in the MultiEthnic dataset. Our studies will determine whether racial
differences in dCK variant, gene expression, and protein activity can correlate with improved Gem efficacy in
B/AA and /or White PDAC patients. The valuable information obtained will significantly advance the overall goal
of improving the response and survival rate in PDAC patients."

Poor decisions can have severe consequences, and impaired decision-making behavior is a symptom of many
neurological and psychiatric disorders. Decision theory recognizes two forms of uncertainty: risk – in which the
underlying probability distributions are known, and ambiguity – in which the underlying probability distributions
are not known. Risk is the conceptual foundation for the Expected Utility theory. Despite its enduring influence
in economics, this theory fails to adequately describe real-world choice behavior. One reason is that pure risk is
rare: it is only encountered in casinos, coin-flips, and decision-making experiments. In the real world, incomplete
information, sparse data, and cognitive limitations create states of uncertainty that exist on a spectrum between
pure risk and blind ignorance. Therefore, ambiguity, rather than risk, describes the conditions under which most
decision-making occurs. In ambiguous circumstances, it is impossible to calculate expected utilities. Instead,
decision makers (consciously or subconsciously) substitute beliefs for expected utility estimations, and this has
consequences for healthy individuals and those with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Healthy decision
makers exhibit ambiguity aversion: they avoid ambiguous prospects, even when doing so is costly. Individuals
with prefrontal dysfunctions perform poorly during choices under ambiguity, even when choices under risk remain
relatively intact. Despite the prevalence of ambiguity and its consequences, it is not known how neurons code
for the uncertainty associated with ambiguity, or how these neural estimates are used for decision making. To
understand how neural circuits implement economic choices and how this implementation may be altered with
prefrontal dysfunction, we will use a non-human primate model to characterize the contributions of cognitive and
reward systems to decisions under ambiguity, and to provide a mechanistic understanding of ambiguity aversion.
The central hypothesis of this project is that ambiguity aversion results from the metacognitive appraisal of
probability judgements. In other words, it is not beliefs, but rather decision makers’ confidence in those beliefs,
that causes ambiguity aversion. We will use behavioral analysis, neurophysiology, and genetically coded
silencers to probe the functions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dopamine neurons and answer three
fundamental questions. (1) How is ambiguity coded and transformed into beliefs? (2) What are the roles of
cognitive systems in estimating ambiguity and making good choices? (3) How does confidence in probability
judgements affect decisions? We predict that uncertainty coding in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be less
reliable in ambiguous, when compared to risky, conditions and lead to lower certainty, lower confidence, and,
ultimately, ambiguity aversion. Our results will increase understanding of the neural basis of decision-making
under ambiguity and provide insights into diagnosis and treatment options for an array of human disease states."

The Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Health (PCC) recognizes that achieving diversity of its
membership and leadership is not only a moral imperative, but is necessary to maximize progress in cancer
prevention and therapy and thereby reduce the cancer burden of an increasingly diverse America. We are
committed to developing a workforce that “looks like the community we serve”, a goal that requires a sustained,
multi-level, and long-term commitment to develop the leadership potential of current faculty, identify and recruit
a diverse cohort of new trainees and faculty, and build a large pipeline of talented younger individuals who will
become our colleagues and leaders of the future. The new PCC Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Core (DEIC)
was established to fulfill this commitment by developing an explicit plan to achieve these objectives and monitor
progress towards reaching our goals. The mission of DEIC is to engage in measurable actions that ensure that
PCC membership and leadership reflect the diversity of the population that we serve, with the ultimate goal of
eliminating disparities in the burden of cancer. DEIC is directed by PCC member Joseph Ravenell MD, MS,
Associate Professor of Population Health and Medicine, Associate Dean of Diversity & Inclusion, and a nationally
recognized leader in health and cancer disparities research. He is aided by Assistant Director Michelle Lightfoot,
MD, MPH, whose research interest is in health disparities in gynecologic oncology. The Specific Aims of DEIC
are: 1) to enhance the diversity of PCC leadership to include groups nationally underrepresented in the research
workforce. 2) to expand the diversity of PCC membership and workforce to reflect the diversity of the population
served by PCC, and 3) to increase diversity in the pipeline of future PCC members and workforce through
mentorship and training of students, trainees, and allied health professionals. Because diversity, equity, and
inclusion are critical to best cancer care and science, DEIC is essential to the PCC mission."

The Cancer Genome Dynamics Program (CGD) investigates how DNA sequence, DNA methylation, chromatin
modifications, DNA damage, and 3D chromosomal organization coordinately affect transcriptional output. CGD
laboratory scientists gain insight into how alterations at any of these levels initiate and/or promote tumor
formation and progression, and CGD clinical investigators translate these discoveries into new prevention
strategies, diagnostic technologies, and cutting-edge clinical trials. The Program focuses on major cancer
burdens and disparities in our catchment area, guided by formal interactions via the CGD designated Liaison
with the Community Outreach and Engagement Core, Program meetings and retreats, and close engagement
with PCC Disease Management Groups and Disease Centers. Emphasis is placed on breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and multiple myeloma in the Black and Ashkenazi populations of our catchment area. CGD is also home
to faculty who investigate the carcinogenic impact of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster, smoking, air
pollution, metals, and other toxic agents. Research in CGD is focused around three thematic aims: Aim 1: To
determine fundamental mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic regulation and their dysregulation in cancer, Aim
2: To elucidate the role of DNA damage and repair in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and Aim 3: To
discover changes in chromosome architecture that activate oncogenic transcriptional programs. CGD has 3 co-
leaders, Hannah Klein, PhD (Basic), William Carroll, MD (translational) and Faith Davies, MD (clinical). Our
58 Members and 8 Associate Members come from 9 Departments at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and
two other NYU campuses. Current cancer-relevant funding is $27.3M, with 7.7M from the NCI, a 91% increase
since 2018, which has led to an increase in the depth and breadth of the Program. Members published 1,094
cancer-related papers (a 52% increase from the last funding cycle), including 21% intra-programmatic, 29%
inter-programmatic, and 45% inter-institutional (with other NCI-CCs) collaborative manuscripts. Our basic
research resulted in numerous high-impact, paradigm-shifting publications (35% in journals with IF >10; 17% in
those with IF>15), new intellectual property, new drug discovery companies, and innovative clinical trials. CGD
clinical investigators accrued 2,523 patients to interventional and non-interventional clinical trials during the
funding period. Members extensively use and have enhanced PCC Shared Resources with new computational
pipelines, humanized mouse models that incorporate custom designed synthetic DNA molecules, ‘on demand’
PDX lines, and single molecule biophotonics. We also develop cutting-edge molecular genetic tests for clinical
use."

The Cancer Cell Biology Program (CCB) personalizes cancer therapy by i) elucidating signaling and metabolic
networks controlling key cancer cell functions, ii) employing cutting-edge chemical biology and biologics to target
rate-limiting pathways in cancer, and iii) translating these insights to the clinic as improved therapies or
biomarkers that more accurately predict patient response. We address key cancer problems in our catchment
area, facilitated by biannual meetings with the Community Outreach and Engagement Core and our designated
CCB Liaison. Particular emphasis is placed on melanoma, and lung, pancreas, triple negative breast, and
prostate cancer, reflecting major catchment area burdens and disparities. Research is organized around three
complementary thematic aims: Aim 1: Identify regulatory mechanisms for key cancer-relevant genes that confer
selective dependencies in human tumors, Aim 2: Delineate how metabolism is reprogrammed in cancer and
discover targetable metabolic vulnerabilities, and Aim 3: Use structural, chemical, protein engineering, and
pharmacologic approaches to target cancer cell dependencies for therapeutic benefit. CCB is under tripartite
leadership by Richard Possemato, PhD (Basic), Alec Kimmelman, MD, PhD (Translational), and Vamsidhar
Velcheit, MD (Clinical). Our 53 Members and 14 Associate Members hail from 12 Departments at NYU Grossman
School of Medicine, the NYU Department of Chemistry, and the NYU College of Dentistry. CCB Members have
$24.2M in cancer-related funding (41% increase), including $8.3M in NCI grants (32% increase). Members are
highly productive and collaborative, publishing 806 peer-reviewed papers in high-impact journals (36% with
IF>10, 19% IF>15), with 16% intra-programmatic, 36% inter-programmatic, and 42% inter-institutional
publications during the current funding period. We filed 41 patents (19 licensed), had 26 patents issued (7
licensed), and created 5 biotechnology companies. Most importantly, CCB members made seminal findings with
clinical impact, including identifying novel signaling networks or metabolic dependencies. CCB houses the
Perlmutter Cancer Center (PCC) Biologics Initiative, which produced antibodies licensed to BioPharma and in
clinical trials or late-stage pre-clinical development. Multiple CCB discoveries have advanced along the
translational pipeline, including into clinical trials that are, or will soon be, open at PCC. CCB clinical investigators
also led 15 IITs, 4 ISTs, and multi-site trials and totaled 3,548 accruals, a dramatic increase driven by recruitment
of additional clinical trialists."

The Tumor Immunology Program (TIM) unites investigators who share a commitment to work collaboratively
to advance our understanding of the relationship between cancer and the immune system and to develop
innovative and effective immune-based therapeutics. The overarching goal of TIM is to elucidate mechanisms
of interaction between the immune system and cancer cells, providing the rationale for more effective
approaches to cancer treatment. We focus our efforts on major cancer burdens and disparities in our catchment
area, guided by formal interactions with the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COE), Program
meetings and retreats, and close engagement with Disease Management Groups (DMGs) and Disease Centers.
TIM Members operate at three levels: (i) Basic research investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms
that regulate the immune response to cancer, (ii) Translational research that advances basic findings into
potential therapies and tests these therapies in appropriate preclinical models, (iii) Clinical research that designs
and executes clinical trials testing novel immune-based cancer vaccines or innovative immunotherapies.
Research is organized around 3 complementary Thematic Aims: Aim 1: To discover basic mechanisms
regulating anti-tumor immunity and its evasion by cancer cells, Aim 2: To elucidate the effect of the microbiome
on anti-tumor immunity and response to therapy, Aim 3: To develop and implement clinical strategies to enhance
the efficacy of immunotherapy. TIM comprise 41 Members, drawn from 10 Departments in NYU Grossman
School of Medicine, School of Arts and Sciences, Tandon School of Engineering and College of Dentistry.
Members are PIs on 125 funded cancer-related projects, delivering $27.3M in annual direct costs ($7.7M NCI).
During the current funding period, TIM members produced paradigm-shifting basic research findings in cancer
immunology, and conducted several practice-changing clinical trials. Our research also led to the design of
several new immune-based therapeutics, and over the past 5 years TIM physician members accrued 805
patients to interventional therapeutic trials. Several innovative early phase clinical trials emanated directly from
basic science research in TIM laboratories. Since 2018, program members published 778 cancer-related papers,
many in high impact journals (~27% in journals with IF >15). The program is highly interactive, as exemplified by
our 27 active multi-PI grants and collaborative publications (15% intra-programmatic, 28% inter-programmatic,
50% inter-NCI-CC). TIM members have filed 46 patents (13 of which have been licensed) and had 13 patents
issued (4 licensed). TIM derives great benefit from being an integral part of PCC. In the current cycle, TIM
members received pilot funding from PCC totaling $ $440,663 of CCSG Developmental Funds and $50,000 of
Institutional funds, (a total of $490,663), which resulted in 3 publications, 3 new grants, 2 patents, and a new
company (Over-T Bio). Future Plans include additional recruitments in key immunologic areas, increased
translation of laboratory science to the clinic, and additional submissions for team science grants."

The vision of the Epidemiology and Cancer Control Program (ECC) is to reduce the cancer burden in the
PCC catchment area and beyond. To achieve this vision, we conduct innovative and high impact research,
discovering risk factors and translating this knowledge into effective cancer control. Under the continued
leadership of Jiyoung Ahn, PhD and new Co-Leader Danil Makarov, MD, MHS, ECC organizes its research
efforts into four complementary thematic aims: Aim1: To discover and effectively modulate cancer-causing
microbial and genetic risk factors, Aim 2: To assess and effectively control cancer-causing environmental and
behavioral risk factors, and Aim 3: To improve cancer care delivery by identifying and disseminating best
practices across the care continuum. The Program is composed of 37 full members from 15 academic
departments in the NYU Grossman School of Medicine (NYUGSoM), particularly the Department of Population
Health, as well as the NYU College of Nursing, College of Dentistry, and College of Global Public Health. ECC
members currently have 76 funded projects totaling $13.1M in annual direct costs, $5.5M from NCI (43% of peer-
reviewed funding). Our members are highly collaborative, as indicated by 34% intra- and 21% inter-programmatic
collaborations, 52% inter-institutional collaborations (with other NCI-CCs), and 32 multi-PI grants. Program
members published 858 papers in the current period, including many in top tier journals, such as NEJM, Lancet,
and JAMA Pediatrics (19% of publications [n=163] have IF>10). Our signature research on the microbiome has
led to novel discoveries of cancer-causing microbial risk factors, published in JAMA Oncology, Gut, JNCI and
already cited more than 250 times; these paradigm-shifting hypotheses on microbial contribution to these
malignancies have also fueled translation to clinical trials and stimulated new avenues of basic science research.
Our work on developing innovative smoking control methods and assessing air pollution—cancer risk
relationships impacted major health policy locally in our catchment area and nationally. Our health services
research, including studies of optimized imaging use and active surveillance, helped inform standard guidelines of
care for prostate cancer patients. ECC has continued to make exceptionally high impact scientific contributions,

incidence and outcome disparities in historically underserved and minoritized populations. We focus on specific
cancer burdens and disparities in our catchment area, which include: 1) a high burden of lung, colorectal, breast,
and prostate cancer across all areas and groups, 2) particularly high rates of oro-digestive, microbe-related
cancers (head and neck, cervical, stomach, liver, and colorectal) in Asian, Black, and Hispanic/”Latine”
communities, 3) enrichment of specific cancer subtypes, such as triple negative breast cancer and highly
aggressive prostate cancer, in Black, Latine, and Ashkenazi Jewish communities, and 4) increasing trends of
liver, melanoma, pancreas, and lung cancers in NYC. COE is guided by the following Thematic Aims: a) to
identify and characterize the cancer burden and disparities in the PCC catchment area, b) to communicate
community needs to PCC research programs and catalyze high impact science, c) to engage the PCC catchment
area in cancer clinical trials and cancer prevention and control research, d) to disseminate PCC research and
evidence-based cancer prevention and control guidelines through culturally tailored approaches to reduce
longstanding cancer disparities in the catchment area, and e) to promote policy translation and dissemination of
PCC research findings and evidence-based strategies. Directed by Chau Trinh-Shevrin, Dr. PH, with co-leaders
Simona Kwon, Dr. PH and Joseph Ravenell, MD, national leaders in health equity research, COE is guided
by a diverse and robust Community Advisory Board to support community-driven PCC research and a Brooklyn
Community Cancer Action Network to lead signature initiatives in its catchment area. By collaborating closely
with community stakeholders, COE ensures a culture of inclusiveness and equity and supports bidirectional
communication between PCC catchment area communities and researchers to advance high impact science.
Major contributions during the funding period include the dissemination of best practices for community health
worker-driven patient navigation strategies and advancing a social determinants of health approach to cancer
prevention, screening, and control. Proposed strategies for the next cycle will enhance community outreach and
recruitment into cancer clinical trials and community-driven research initiatives that will inform national efforts to
reduce cancer disparities."

Developmental Funds are a key financial resource that Perlmutter Cancer Center (PCC) has used to facilitate
its strategic goals and vision. During the current cycle, these funds were used for two purposes. Support was
provided to two Developing Cores, both of which were highly successful. The Metabolomics Developing Core
is presented as a full shared resource in the current application. Data Core is now an institutionally funded
resource (Data Hub). was to support promising pilot studies in basic, translational, clinical, and population
sciences that aligned with the objectives of the PCC Strategic Plan and address major cancer burdens and/or
disparities in our catchment area. Selected projects were expected to have a high likelihood of producing
important discoveries and publications, future peer-reviewed grants, and/or new intellectual property (IP).
Preference was given to multi-investigator projects with the potential to catalyze new team science that
addresses catchment area needs. Funds were also allocated to novel investigator-initiated clinical trials without
other/adequate sources of funding. Young investigators without significant funding, or more established faculty
who wished to expand their focus to include cancer-related research but who lack external funding for this
purpose, were also considered for Developmental Funds support. Pilot projects are selected by the
Developmental Funds Committee following a rigorous 2-stage, NIH-like review process and managed by the
Administrative Office (AO). The impact of allocated funds as measured by publications, new grant
applications/grants, submitted or issued patents, and/or other intellectual property was monitored by
Developmental Funds Committee, the AO, and the Executive Management Committee to assess the
success of the program. Pilot funds were allocated to all four Research Programs during the current funding
period and were highly impactful. Return on investment was ~570%, as measured by new grant funding. These
funds also yielded multiple impactful papers, new IP, the creation of two biotechnology companies, and several
investigator-initiated trials. Over half of the projects addressed major cancer burdens and/or disparities in the
PCC catchment area. In the next funding period, we propose to support similarly impactful pilot studies. The
Specific Aims of Developmental Funds are: 1) To fund innovative cancer research pilot projects that advance
the overall goals of the Strategic Plan and address the needs of the PCC catchment area, 2) To foster and
develop collaborative, transdisciplinary research involving teams of basic, translational, clinical, and population
investigators, 3) To develop and support young investigators or established faculty with an emerging interest in
cancer-related investigation, and 4) to develop and support novel investigator-initiated early phase clinical trials
and/or interventional studies that support disease management group-related goals and strategies."
10781937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during adolescence negatively impacts brain networks underlying
cognitive, social, and emotional function. Early intervention is important for mitigating long-term effects, but
about 20% of youth do not improve sufficiently with current approaches. By identifying the neurobiological
mechanisms of effective therapies, we facilitate the development of novel or personalized treatment
approaches for youth with PTSD. However, there has been limited progress in identifying the neural
mechanisms of treatment using neuroimaging, partly because most studies collect neuroimaging data at only
baseline and end-of-treatment, which collapses across multiple parts of the therapeutic process. The objective
of the proposed study is to take a new approach by identifying neural mechanisms associated with specific
phases of trauma therapy for youth with PTSD. Our central hypothesis is that each phase produces specific
brain changes that reflect the acquisition of skills and experiences occurring during that phase. Trauma-
Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is evidence-based and widely-used to treat children and
adolescents with PTSD. It consists of 3 well-defined phases, providing an opportunity to test our hypotheses
with neuroimaging: changes in executive control networks will occur during the skills phase, changes in limbic
networks during the narrative phase, and changes in default mode networks during the consolidation phase.
To test these hypotheses, we will recruit N=180 girls and boys, ages 12-17, who have PTSD following
interpersonal trauma, such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, or witnessing violence. We will use a randomized
controlled trial design to assign participants to either TF-CBT (provided by study team clinicians who meet
fidelity standards and receive consultation from Dr. Judith Cohen, the treatment developer) or Treatment as
Usual (TAU; provided in the community and does not follow a phased structure). We will collect functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data before and after each of the 3 phases of TF-CBT or the same time
intervals of TAU. Individual differences in age, sex, dissociative subtype, symptom severity and other variables
will be investigated as covariates of phase-related neural changes. Analyses will identify the phases of TF-
CBT for which brain regions and networks change for the TF-CBT but not the TAU group. We will also identify
the phase(s) that best predict end-of-treatment symptom improvement. Exploratory analyses will use
neuroanatomical and white matter diffusivity scans to identify co-occurring changes in brain structure. The
proposed innovative study will provide novel information on the neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms
associated with the process of trauma therapy for youth with PTSD.

High blood pressure (BP), particularly systolic BP (SBP), is the major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) and related conditions such as chronic kidney disease and cognitive decline/dementia. In fact,
~60% of adults in the United States have above-normal SBP (≥120 mmHg). Above-normal SBP is associated
with vascular endothelial dysfunction, a key antecedent for developing CVD. In addition, rates of BP control
continue to worsen, predicting a new epidemic of disorders driven by above-normal SBP unless innovative
therapies with clinical efficacy for lowering SBP can be adopted by and translated to the public.
High-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a novel, low-barrier, time-efficient, lifestyle
intervention involving repeated inhalations against resistance with a hand-held device. In a randomized,
double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group design, pilot study in men and women (n=36) with initial SBP
≥120 mmHg, I showed that IMST (30 breaths/day [~5 min/day] at 75% maximal inspiratory pressure [PIMAX], 6
days/week for 6 weeks) had excellent adherence (94% of prescribed training sessions completed), increased
inspiratory muscle strength (~20% increase in PIMAX), lowered SBP by 9 mmHg, and improved vascular
endothelial function by ~45% compared to low-resistance sham training – thus establishing the clinical efficacy
of high-resistance IMST. However, this trial was performed with frequent researcher supervision and feedback.
Therefore, the next step in the overall translation of IMST for improving public health is to establish a vehicle
for dissemination of IMST by utilizing digital health technologies.
In this R03 application, I propose to pilot-test a smartphone app that independently guides users through an
IMST intervention. I will directly compare the efficacy of 6 weeks (30 breaths/day, 6 days/week, 75% PIMAX) of
at-home, app-guided IMST vs. an established clinic-based, investigator-supervised IMST program. I
hypothesize that at-home IMST with a smartphone app will lower SBP, improve vascular endothelial function,
promote adherence and increase inspiratory muscle strength to a similar extent as clinic-based IMST. I also
will utilize an innovative follow-up period in which adherence to IMST and changes in home SBP are monitored
for an additional 12 months after completing the randomized controlled trial, under free-living conditions, in all
study participants; this will provide invaluable real-world data to inform future trial designs.
Aim 1: To determine changes in home SBP after 6 weeks of at-home or clinic-based IMST in men and women
with above-normal SBP at baseline. Safety and tolerability also will be assessed.
Aim 2: To measure a) adherence; b) the change in PIMAX; and c) the change in vascular endothelial function
after 6 weeks of at-home or clinic-based IMST.
Aim 3: To monitor adherence to IMST and changes in home SBP during a 12-month free-living follow-up
period in which all participants are given unrestricted access to the IMST smartphone app and training device."

 Traditional approaches to understanding the neural bases of choice and control involve discrete choice
tasks. In these tasks, decision-makers make categorical decisions at a single point in time. While such tasks
have led to invaluable insights, they are poorly suited to shed light on one of the key elements of natural
decisions, their continuous nature. Continuous decisions are especially interesting as a laboratory tool for
studying the neural basis of persistence, which is a key ingredient of drug abstinence and which is difficult to
capture with discrete decision-making tasks. Understanding the neural basis of continuous decisions is critical
for developing an understanding of the neural circuitry of decision-making. Using discrete choice tasks,
neuroscience has made great strides in understanding choice and control, and has begun to pin down the role
of a key brain structure, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Activity of single neurons in this region
encodes multiple variables associated with aspects of discrete decisions and also with monitoring the
outcomes of those decisions and adjusting behavior appropriately afterward. Aberrant activity in the dACC is
also associated with the progression of diseases associated with poor self-control and persistence, such as
addiction. These facts suggest strongly that the dACC plays a pivotal role in continuous decisions as well. Our
central hypothesis is that both monitoring and decision processes in continuous decision-making are
implemented, at least in part, by dACC. One critical barrier to studying continuous decisions is the lack of
readily usable laboratory tasks that are trainable in model animals, reliably performable for hundreds of trials,
that elicit persistence, and that motivate continuous adjustment. Our lab has recently developed a guided
pursuit task for rhesus macaques. In this task, subjects use a joystick to control an avatar on a computer
screen. Using this avatar, they pursue virtual fleeing prey and avoid pursuing predators (in other words, it is a
kind of simplified Pac-man). Our proposed research program will answer the following key questions: How
does the dACC track movements of agents in guided pursuit? What are the behavioral and neural bases of
future state prediction in guided pursuit? What are the neural bases of changes of mind in continuous
decisions?"

 This research program (CA-19033), now in the fortieth year, embodies our long-term
commitment to complete structural characterization and efficient enantiomeric synthesis of
architecturally challenging agents, possessing bio-regulatory properties related to cancer
chemotherapy. Specifically, we will demonstrate that Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC), a tactic
introduced by our laboratory, and now Radical Relay Chemistry (RRC), holds great promise for
the rapid, efficient construction of multi-gram quantities of stereo-defined, structurally complex
synthetic intermediates and natural products having cancer cell growth inhibitory activities.
 Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC), the early principal chemical innovation of this program,
originated from a three-component union protocol, that comprises a [1,4]-Brook rearrangement
to assemble complex arrays, employed initially for the total synthesis of the spongistatins 1 and
2, and in turn the synthesis of the frog alkaloid 205B and indolizidine 223AB. Subsequently, we
generalized this concept to what we now term Anion Relay Chemistry (ARC). More recently we
added the tactic of Radical Relay Chemistry. This five-year renewal application will significantly
augment, demonstrate and showcase the utility of both ARC and RRC tactics for the rapid, and
now in a potentially multi-iteration format, access to complex molecular fragments (vide infra),
readily available from enantiomerically pure starting materials.
 With this introduction, the Specific Aims for years 41-45 will be: (A) apply our highly
flexible ARC multi-component fragment union protocols to achieve rapid access to polyol-
containing anticancer products, including neaumycin B, bastimolide A, penniciketal A and (-)-
pterocidin; (B) exploit our innovative ARC [3+2] annulation for the syntheses of euphornin L;
(C) showcase our “Through-Bond/Through-Space” ARC tactic for the construction the cytotoxic
agents pyxipyrrolones A and B; (D) demonstrate the innovative use of Radical Relay Chemistry
(RRC) to construct the complex spiroketallactone structures for the synthesis of the cytotoxic
agents, the sequoiamonascins; (E) demonstrate diversity-oriented synthesis for the rare
members of the nahuoic acid family of SETD8 inhibitors; and (F) continue our active
collaborations to evaluate the cancer biology of these anticancer agents.
 Beyond these synthetic objectives, a general, long-range goal of this program is the
identification of molecular receptors responsible for biological activity. Thus, as we develop an
approach to each target structure, we will also prepare model compounds designed to permit
elucidation of structure-activity relationships to be defined by our biological collaborators."

Mutations in rod photoreceptor-specific genes in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cause diminished
peripherial and night-time vision. But, it is secondary loss of cone function, leading to
diminished high-resolution daylight vision utilized for reading, facial recognition and other daily
tasks that is most debilitating. Events leading to loss of cone function in RP are still being
unraveled. Like other neurons, photoreceptors depend upon glucose, which they use for
energy as well as ongoing synthesis to replace visual pigment-rich membraneous outer
segments (OS) as they undergo daily light-induced phagocytosis. The RPE serves as a
blood-outer retinal barrier transporting glucose and nutrients from the choroid circulation
to adjacent photoreceptors. We provide evidence that glucose transport from the RPE to
photoreceptors for new OS synthesis is linked to OS phagocytosis. As abundant mutant
rod OS are lost and phagocytosis diminishes in RP, glucose transport becomes short-

glucose transport from the RPE and linked metabolome/epigenome changes in these

cones are concentrated into a visual streak."
10784681,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Binocular vision relies on a synergy between sensory and motor fusional mechanisms that jointly construct a
single percept of the environment from the differing images formed on the two retinae. A stereoscopic sensory
representation of the environment is required for accurate binocular eye movements, which in turn are required
for stereoscopic sensory vision. A failure in either component of this system, especially during development, can
lead to permanent binocular vision impairment. Sensory impairments can include amblyopia, diplopia and
suppression, oculomotor impairments can include strabismus and vergence insufficiency, while socio-economic
sequelae include lost education, sport and job opportunities and elevated adverse health risks. The current
treatments for amblyopia (occlusion and penalization) are primarily monocular and do not promote binocular
perception or eye movement coordination. Similarly, treatments for strabismus do not typically address binocular
perception. These limitations are at least partly due to a lack of practical methodologies for the assessment of
sensory-motor function and partly due to a lack of coordinated sensory-motor therapies.
Recent data show that there is significant plasticity in both sensory systems and motor systems, even in adults.
Many groups are now exploring methods to promote sensory plasticity with digitally modified images in
dichoptic games and movies, but considerably less attention has been directed to motor plasticity or sensory
and motor plasticity together. We hypothesize that additional therapeutic gains and a lower risk of adverse side
effects may be achieved with a combined sensory-motor therapeutic approach that is monitored by effective
sensory-motor endpoints. We argue i) that the pace of commercialization of virtual reality therapies for
anisometropic amblyopia intensifies the need simultaneously to understand sensory and oculomotor deficits in
strabismic amblyopia and ii) that the high levels of recidivism following surgical intervention may benefit from
combined sensorimotor rehabilitation. In Aim 1, we develop and evaluate efficient methods to measure sensory
and motor deficits in people with binocular vision impairment and to provide a quantitative framework for
evidence-based assessment of sensory-motor therapy. In Aim 2, we measure the impact across the visual field
of strabismus on the three-dimensional representation of virtual and natural environments to understand how
the distribution of naturally occurring depth statistics across the visual field may impact the development of
binocular sensory and motor deficits and moderate their response to treatment. In Aim 3, we develop and
evaluate feedback-based methods that aim to facilitate and maintain ocular alignment and examine the
potential benefit of simultaneous sensory and motor interventions for binocular visual function. In each Aim, we
employ both laboratory stimuli, because of their high level of control, and natural and virtual 3D scenes,
because of their rich structure and relevance to real-world deficits. The overall goal is to demonstrate the
theoretical foundation for combined sensory and motor therapeutic approaches to binocular visual dysfunction."
10784689,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Trastuzumab, a monoclonal directed against the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-2 (HER-2),
revolutionized HER-2-positive breast cancer treatment, albeit, with the therapy-limiting side effect of cardiotoxicity.
We found that 40% of patients experience a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline >10% during
trastuzumab therapy, and 4% develop heart failure (HF). In 25-50% of these cases, the LVEF decline is not fully
reversible, even with cardiovascular therapy. Genetic contributors to cardiac vulnerability and the best
cardiovascular management strategy are unknown. A critical need exists for cardio-preventive approaches in
patients at risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.
The current application’s objective is to evaluate cardio-protective approaches using carvedilol in curative-intent
trastuzumab for HER-2-positive breast cancer. Our central hypotheses are that a pre-emptive preventive
approach (cardiovascular therapy with the beta-blocker carvedilol started before trastuzumab therapy), or a reactive
preventive approach (cardiovascular therapy started in response to early subclinical signs of cardiac dysfunction/
injury, i.e. cardiac troponin elevation or abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS)) will reduce cardiotoxicity
compared with a standard “wait-and-see” approach (carvedilol prescribed once cardiotoxicity has occured).
We furthermore hypothesize that carvedilol extension beyond the active trastuzumab treatment leads to superior
outcomes and that pharmacogenomics can predict cardiotoxicity non-responsive to cardiovascular therapy with
carvedilol. This clinical trial will test these hypotheses, involving 450 adult breast cancer patients beginning a year of
curative-intent trastuzumab therapy, randomized to either a preemptive, a reactive, or reference care approach.
This study addresses three specific study aims:
Aim 1: To compare the incidence of a) HF or asymptomatic decline in LVEF by >10% in those with LVEF ≥50% or
≥5% in those with LVEF decrease to a nadir of <50% (lead primary aim #1), and b) reversible LVEF decline to
within 5% of baseline (secondary primary aim #1) with a pre-emptive, reactive, and “wait-and-see” approach of
carvedilol initiation in breast cancer patients over the course of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. This aim addresses
the question of initiation of cardioprotective efforts for trastuzumab therapy.
Aim 2: To compare the delta change in LVEF from completion to 1 year post-completion of trastuzumab therapy
between a cardioprotective approach with carvedilol confined the duration of trastuzumab therapy or extended for 1
year thereafter. This aim addresses the question of duration of cardioprotective efforts for trastuzumab therapy.
Aim 3: To test the association of predefined genetic variants with change in GLS and LVEF during and after
trastuzumab therapy, adjusted for treatment arm. This aim is to identify genetic variants that predict trastuzumab
cardiotoxicity in general as well as lack of response (primary prevention of drop in LVEF or secondary improvement
of LVEF) to carvedilol.
This trial’s completion will guide clinical care in seeking the best management strategy (“tactic”) for cardio-protection
in breast cancer patients undergoing trastuzumab therapy in terms of efficacy, time of initiation, and duration of
treatment with the beta-blocker carvedilol."

(HIVRT) program led by the University at Buffalo (UB) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). Optimizing HIV
prevention of transmission with HIV PReP and treatment as prevention (TasP) to meet 95-95-95 and “ending
the epidemic” strategies. However, successful use of these approaches requires that continued research be
conducted to guide implementation in low-middle income countries. The HIVRT will increase the number of
qualified investigators to seek external funding for this research effort. With the introduction of tenofovir,
lamivudine and dolutegravir, long-acting ARVs (e.g., cabotegravir, rilpivirine), new ARVs (e.g., lenacapavir,
islatravir) and HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNABs), clinical and translational research related to these
new therapeutic agents is needed to examine the optimal pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics parameters that
will prevent transmission and/or sustain viral load suppression as well as safety in the context of co-morbidities.
Training of clinician-scientists and translational scientists will utilize the foundation that has been built by the prior
UB-UZ HIVRT and transition to the newly designed research training program. Specific Aims: 1) Provide a HIVRT
for pre-doctoral (5) and post-doctoral (5) trainees that increases the number of researchers with independent,
funded programs with a focus on HIV clinical pharmacology and therapeutics and regional public health priorities
including COVID-19, 2) Mentor HIVRT trainees in team science and that include others with expertise in
pharmaceutical bioanalysis, biomedical informatics, data sciences, genomics, and microbiome, 3) Foster
community support group engagement to participate in innovative research to study novel HIV clinical
pharmacology and therapeutics strategies for prevention and treatment and investigate long-acting
antiretrovirals and monoclonal antibodies and traditional medicines, and 4) Provide an HIVRT that fosters smart
academic-public-private partnerships aimed at addressing sustainable developmental goals. Trainees will have
intensive training at UB during which new knowledge and skills will allow formulation of a research project that
will be conducted under continued supervision for 18 months at UZ for a total of two years of training. The
program will build on our prior Fogarty International Center HIV Research Training program, and an earlier
AITRP. These research training programs provide the foundation for this D43 renewal that includes an
outstanding group of UZ and UB mentors who will provide mentoring and collaboration utilizing the HIV Clinical
Pharmacology and Therapeutics foundation that has been built for HIV clinical and translational research. The
curriculum will be organized and provided through an established Research and Education Training Core. The
D43 has an outstanding external Training Advisory Committee that will contribute to a highly productive, efficient
HIV Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics research training initiative in Zimbabwe."
10784725,"Mechanisms of voltage regulation of membrane transport
SLC9 family of membrane transporters couple the import of sodium ions to export of protons.
They are vital for regulation of cytoplasmic and endosomal pH, which in turn affect several
physiological processes. Their disfunction has been linked to many diseases such as diabetes,
hypertension, heart failure and cancer. Genetic mutations in specific SLC9 members have also
been associated with Angelman-syndrome like disorders, ADHD, familial autism, epilepsies and
male infertility. The SLC9C1 is a unique member of the SLC9 family. Unlike other SLC9s which
feature a membrane delimited sodium-hydrogen exchange (NHE) domain and a usually short and
relatively unstructured C-terminal soluble domain, SLC9C1 combines an NHE, a voltage-sensing
domain (VSD) and a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD), interconnected via long, structured
linkers, in a single polypeptide. Recent foundational experiments have revealed that membrane
hyperpolarization and binding of cyclic nucleotides potentiates ion transport via SLC9C1. Its
unique design makes it impossible to predict how voltage and ligand regulation of this protein is
manifested at a structural level. SLC9C1 exhibits sperm-specific expression and has been shown
to be critical for sperm motility in mouse and humans. Sperm motility is robustly modulated by
changes in membrane voltage, intracellular cAMP levels and pH and all these stimuli influence
SLC9C1 mediated ion exchange directly, making it vital to understand the molecular
underpinnings of such diverse regulation. To this end, in this proposal we will integrate single-
particle cryo-electron microscopy and reconstruction techniques with biochemical and
electrophysiological methods to explore key biophysical mechanisms of SLC9C1. In Aim 1, we
will determine the first high-resolution structure of SLC9C1 and identify the key interactions
governing its organization. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the structural rearrangements in SLC9C1
triggered by cyclic nucleotide binding and use electrophysiology to test the role of a key interface
in mediating the regulatory effects of the CNBD. In Aim 3, we will determine how pH and permeant
ions affect the structure and function of SLC9C1. The proposal has a strong scientific foundation
built on our rigorous preliminary studies. It is innovative as it will provide the first snapshots of a
novel membrane protein in different conformations and test provocative hypotheses on the
mechanisms of voltage and cyclic nucleotide regulation of a transporter. The insights obtained
from our studies will aid structure-based drug design for treatment of male infertility. It will also
have broad implications on the structural and functional mechanisms of SLC9 regulation by their
cytoplasmic domains further underscoring its importance for human health."
10815746,"Malaria still afflicts about half of the world population causing more than 400,000 deaths, mostly
children. The global economic toll of malaria is enormous. Most of the drugs that are currently
utilized for malaria treatment, including artemisinin-based combination treatments are losing
their effectiveness due to widespread emergence of drug resistance. To address the fragility of
malaria therapy, we propose to discover novel antimalarial compounds through screening of a
library of fungal secondary metabolites. We hypothesize that fungal secondary metabolites, which
are underexplored for antimalarial discovery, will provide us with a unique opportunity to
investigate medicinally relevant but untapped chemical space for the discovery of novel malaria
therapeutics. Premise for this proposal is based on our promising preliminary screen that has
identified fungal extracts and pure compounds of fungal origin with potent antiplasmodial activities.
To prove this hypothesis, we propose herein to (1) Screen a library of 10,000 extracts derived
from diverse fungal species and dereplicate prioritized bioactive extracts to identify and
determine structures of selective antiplasmodial compounds that are active against multiple
parasite developmental stages; hits will be screened to determine cross-resistance, and killing
rate. (2) Active compounds will be prioritized by in vitro physicochemical, in vivo pharmacology
and in vivo efficacy studies. (3) Target identification of prioritized hits will be determined by in
vitro evolution of resistance followed by whole genome sequencing. Target validation will be
conducted by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing. The research in this endeavor will be
conducted through a multidisciplinary collaboration between the laboratories of Debopam
Chakrabarti (University of Central Florida), Robert Cichewicz (University of Oklahoma), Kirsten
Hanson (University of Texas San Antonio), Elizabeth Winzeler and Jeremiah Momper
(University of California San Diego) with combined expertise in natural product chemistry,
malaria cell biology, anti-infective discovery, target identification, and validation. This is a highly
significant endeavor, as we will discover novel lead compounds with validated targets for
therapy against multidrug resistant malaria."
10815747,"SUMMARY
Tuberculosis remains a major global public health threat. Although relatively effective drug regimens are
available, treatment failure remains a major roadblock to tuberculosis control. This is in part due to a high
incidence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains, as well as the phenomenon of bacterial
persistence. Persisters represent a reservoir of latent infection, which may progress to active disease when host
immunity is compromised (e.g., with HIV co-infection), and also potentially contribute to the emergence of further
drug resistance. Mtb is able to subvert key innate immune defence mechanisms exerted by the host macrophage;
it can dampen the immune response, subvert macrophage killing and create a protected niche within this host
cell. In the proposed work, the capacity of engineered nanoparticles to favourably modulate the response of
macrophage, through delivered immunomodulatory signals, and achieve death of intracellular Mtb, will be
investigated. These unique nanoparticles mimic Mtb (i.e. bacteriomimetic) in selected aspects of size, shape and
composition. The nanoparticles proposed here are lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles and metal organic
frameworks (spherical and rod shaped) incorporating mycolic acids and/or the fungal wall polysaccharide β-
glucan. Strong published and preliminary data demonstrates the capacity of the polymer nanoparticles to induce
killing of virulent Mtb in macrophages. This killing is only evident in intracellular Mtb and is similar to that achieved
using an antibiotic. Metal organic framework nanoparticles can be synthesized and coated with macrophage
targeting materials. The hypothesis of the project is that bacteriomimetic, immunotherapeutic nanoparticles will
be effective against all forms of Mtb (including drug-resistant and persister populations) through immune
modulation. Specifically, the project has 3 aims: 1) Characterize a panel of bacteriomimetic immunotherapeutic
NPs; 2) Investigate response of infected macrophages and intracellular bacteria to the panel of NPs; 3) Assess
in vivo response to, and efficacy of, NPs in murine infection model. This project is at the cutting edge of
nanotechnology and tuberculosis research, and will provide several exciting research capacity development
opportunities for scientists from South Africa and Zimbabwe (through a partnership with an on-going NIH funded
HIV Research Training Program). The multi-national research team will be led by 3 new investigators, with
research teams from Stellenbosch University, South Africa, the University of the Western Cape (a historically
disadvantaged institution in South Africa) and South Dakota State University in the USA, partnered to propose a
novel immunotherapy approach for tuberculosis based on nanoparticle-based delivery systems. The team has
expertise in nanoparticle formulation and characterisation, in vitro and in vivo infection models, and tuberculosis
immunology. Our results will advance the development of nanoparticle-based, host-directed therapies for
tuberculosis."
10815752,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial
etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An
approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful
phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as
the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore
attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV),
an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when
comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its
etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first
establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity
in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled
opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at
ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and
extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to
utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging
sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals
diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the
validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on
learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about
individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences.
Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which
neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and
drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and
neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles
and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1.
The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably,
identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological,
cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed
toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be
relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism)."
10786116,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. Globally, AFLD accounts for 0.9%
of total mortality and 0.6% of disability-adjusted life years and remains a public health problem worldwide.
Despite its profound health and economic impact, the AFLD management remains challenging due to the lack
of detailed understanding of determinants of its pathogenesis and progression. The goal of this project is to
elucidate a novel role of redox-modulated hepatic O-GlcNAc signaling in alcohol-induced liver injury, and
thereby identify potential novel preventive, diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets against AFLD. Oxidative
stress is implicated to play a central role in many pathways involved in the initiation and progression of AFLD.
Hepatic glutathione (GSH) functions in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Intriguingly, chronic GSH
deficiency in mice harboring a global disruption of the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm) gene
confers protection against alcohol-induced steatosis. Molecular and metabolomics studies indicate that the
hepatoprotective effect of low GSH is linked to activations of AMPK signaling pathway and NRF2 antioxidant
response, and reprogramming of hepatic metabolism that benefits the maintenance of cellular redox and
metabolic homeostasis. Multiomics analyses imply that post-transcriptional mechanisms play a significant role
in mediating low GSH-elicited metabolic adaptation upon ethanol exposure. O-GlcNAcylation of protein is a
prevalent form of post-translational modification (PTM), where a single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-
GlcNAc) moiety is added to nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins. This process is controlled by a
pair of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). In the liver, O-
GlcNAc signaling has been shown to serve as an important mechanism for nutrient and stress sensing and
subsequent regulation of liver cellular homeostasis. Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated in hepatic
insulin resistance, fatty liver disease and associated fibrosis. To date, little is known about the role of O-
GlcNAcylation in AFLD pathogenesis. Our preliminary studies show that, in GSH-deficient Gclm-null mouse
livers, chronic-binge ethanol feeding induced beneficial changes in global O-GlcNAylation and associated
cellular pathways and signaling proteins. This project will expand upon these provocative findings and test the
hypothesis predicting that adaptive O-GlcNAc signaling driven by chronic oxidative stress (due to GSH
deficiency) in the liver protects against alcohol-induced liver injury. We propose to (1) utilize the Gclm-null
mouse model to examine ethanol-induced changes in O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation modifications of
the liver proteome and substrate targeting of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes, and (2) evaluate the functional
impacts of top candidate protein-O-GlcNAcylations in ethanol-associated stress response in human HepaRG
cells. The proposed study will be the first examination of in vivo interplay between hepatic redox status and O-
GlcNAcylation signaling in the context of alcohol induced liver injury."
10786113,"Zinc (Zn) deficiency has emerged as a growing public health problem. In fact, an estimated 17% of the global
population is deficient. Animal studies have demonstrated that even marginal zinc deprivation leads to
significantly impairs physiological functions. This is especially true in the gut where zinc is required to maintain
intestinal homeostasis. Zn deficiency-mediated loss of intestinal homeostasis and microbial dysbiosis have
recently been proposed as major mechanistic pathways for the development and severity of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). Specifically, Zn deficiency is common in patients with IBD with a prevalence ranging from 15% to
40%, likely due to diet deficits and increased intestinal loss. In addition, a common genetic variant of the Zn
transporter ZIP8 (rs13107325; A391T) has been associated with an increased risk of Crohn’s disease. In the
context of gastrointestinal health, it is also notable that zinc is also an essential nutrient for bacteria. As such,
commensals must compete for and scavenge zinc from their host, which likely further effects the host’s ability to
acquire adequate levels of zinc. Bacteria utilize numerous strategies to acquire metal, such as the secretion of
small molecules known as metallophores (i.e., siderophores and zincophores). Overgrowth of pathobionts, which
express high levels of metallophores, is hypothesized to be one mechanism by which the microbiota contributes
to IBD pathogenesis. In this application, we propose a new paradigm in which bacterial metallophore production
is a key mechanistic pathway leading to accelerated IBD disease severity/inflammation. Specifically, we
hypothesize that IBD disease status is associated with a unique subset of microbial metallophores and further
hypothesize that IBD-associated metallophores exacerbate disease severity. Four key findings support this
hypothesis: First, humans with the A391T allele have and increased prevalence of IBD and have significantly
altered intestinal microbial communities. Second, Zip8 393T-KI mice have increased susceptibility to chemically
induced colitis. Third, microbial metallophores are associated with the development of adherent-invasive
Escherichia coli (AIEC)-mediated colitis. Fourth, a novel class of zinc transporters (zincophores) are produced
by a wide-range of known gastrointestinal bacterial species many of which are over-represented in IBD dysbiosis.
To test our hypothesis that bacterial zincophore production is a key mechanistic pathway leading to increased
IBD disease severity, we propose three research Aims: Aim 1 will establish cross-talk between host genetics,
gut microbial composition, bacterial metallophores, and dietary Zn levels as a link to IBD severity. Aim 2 will
determine and characterize the effects of bacterial metallophores on intestinal epithelial health. Aim 3 will seek
to validate the association of bacterial metallophores with IBD disease using a well characterized IBD biobank."

10929459,"Training in Theory and Computation for Next Generation Neuroscientists
Project Summary
To understand the function and dysfunction of the brain it is necessary to confront its complexity. Over the past
two decades the ﬁeld of neuroscience has leveraged the tremendous advances in electronics, genetics, and
microscopy to collect a bewildering amount of neuronal data, especially when compared to the state of the ﬁeld
at the turn of the last century. More than ever these datasets require sophisticated analysis techniques to expose
the salient aspects of brain dynamics and computation. Of equal importance is building a coherent theory of
brain function. Theory can both organize these datasets under a conceptual umbrella, as well as suggest the
next series of experiments to be performed. These realities require more neuroscience researchers to be trained
in a variety of computational and mathematical techniques. This project outlines an ambitious graduate and
undergraduate Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) at the University of Chicago.
 The University of Chicago TPCN has 31 training faculty distributed over 10 departments. The training faculty
are composed of 6 faculty in computational neuroscience (dry-lab), 9 training faculty whose laboratories are
primarily experimental, and 15 training faculty whose laboratories are both computational and experimental. At
the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Computational Neuroscience and a complementary PhD
program in Neurobiology. At the undergraduate level the University of Chicago has a highly popular Major in
Neuroscience, and students can Minor in Computational Neuroscience. The TPCN is set within a highly collegial,
cross-disciplinary environment of our Neuroscience Institute and the Grossman Center for Quantitative Biology
and Human Behavior. The Neuroscience Institute was established in 2014 to foster interdisciplinary research on
the neural mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 87 faculty having appointments in 16 departments.
The Grossman Center was launched in 2020 and is a space within the Neuroscience Institute with an explicit
focus on computational and theoretical neuroscience. Over the next ﬁve years the Grossman Center will grow
to house 5 computational neuroscience faculty to complement our already existing community of theoretical
neuroscientists. During this funding period the TPCN will (1) strengthen the course offerings in computational
neuroscience at both the graduate and undergraduate level; (2) create a undergraduate research program in
computational neuroscience; (3) enhance our minority recruitment by taking advantage of the undergraduate
neuroscience research program.
 TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students take a se-
ries of directed courses in computational neuroscience that span both statistical and modeling approaches. To
ensure their competency in core neuroscience principles they also take courses in cellular, systems, and behav-
ioral neuroscience. Their training will be supplemented with courses in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as
computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. All graduate students will have extended experience
in at least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the University
of Chicago Neuroscience community. Supported undergraduates take courses in mathematics, computer pro-
gramming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience or psychology and two
courses in Computational Neuroscience; and they complete a research project. In addition, they complete the
TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer program go through the boot camp on topics in
computational neuroscience, including tutorials in Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equa-
tions, and ideas of neural coding; they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees
will receive training in responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA
graduate students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate school-year and 30 summer fellows."

consortium will include ~8 theme-based National Resource Centers (NRCs) tasked with developing and
sharing specialized resources, tools, technologies, services, and expertise and a National Coordinating Center
(NCC) to lead, manage, and harmonize all aspects of the Consortium. We propose the University of

biostatisticians, kidney physiologists, health behaviorists, and strong research mentors, the proposed NCC
investigator team is interdisciplinary with experience participating in NIDDK-sponsored consortia. UAB has the
infrastructure to lead the NCC including (1) An established Data Management and Analysis Center (DMAC)
with an established data portal that has supported NIH-funded multi-center networks and implemented
programs to enhance collaboration, common data elements, and data sharing, and (2) Experience engaging
patients to ensure research addresses issues that are important to them, (3) A commitment to diversity/equity/
inclusion, (4) Drug development/ entrepreneurship expertise to facilitate the translation of research into better
patient outcomes, and (4) Training programs that will provide support for early-stage investigators that spurs
innovation and impact of their research. Additionally, the UAB investigators have implemented and
administered competitive pilot grant programs that has nurtured the development and provided supported high-
impact research ideas with a substantial return on investment. The UAB NCC has five aims including (1)
Providing administrative support, facilitating communication and coordination, and enhancing synergy by
implementing standard operating procedures and sub-committees for the O’Brien consortium; (2) Expanding
the UAB DMAC to provide a portal for sharing protocols, data, tools and other resources for the O’Brien

near-peer mentoring, and virtual office hours for early-stages investigators to collaborate with the O’Brien
NRCs; (4) Engaging patient viewpoints, priorities and preferences through focus groups and active scientist-
patient interaction to inform the O’Brien NRCs and consortium; and (5) Administering a national pilot program
with pre-submission scientific and biostatistics consultation, rigorous peer review, and ongoing mentorship to
support early-stage investigators, investigators new to kidney research and collaborations with the broader

research nationwide maximizing the impact on improving kidney health."
10763765,"Cell division involves complex interactive pathways that coordinate chromosome movements with cell cycle
transitions. While many regulators that modulate spindle microtubule dynamics, chromosome behavior, and cell
cycle control have been identified, complete understanding of their functions and interactions in controlling
spindle structure and chromosome movement at different stages of mitosis remains incomplete. This deficit in
understanding mitosis is due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of current phenotypic analyses of
manipulations such as protein deletion and mutant expression. The mitotic parts list is large, but continued
discovery of novel mitotic components indicates that it is not yet complete, particularly for vertebrates.
Bioinformatic guidance with the GAMMA algorithm continues to foster our identification of new mitotic regulators
that were missed in previous screens including whole genome screens. Using innovative methods correlating in
vivo and in vitro analysis, members of the laboratory target known and newly identified mitotic regulators, to test
their roles in moving chromosomes during prometaphase, metaphase, and anaphase, in controlling spindle
microtubule dynamic turnover, in generating mechanical tension between kinetochores and microtubules, and
in directing mitotic cell cycle progression. The proposed projects combine many advanced strategies including
high resolution, low phototoxicity, light sheet microscopy, degron tagging of endogenous genes, antibody-
mediated protein degradation, and instantaneous, live cell quantitation of kinetochore-microtubule tension.
These techniques are coupled with advanced image analysis. This new sophistication of phenotype analysis will
vertically advance understanding of the functions of known and newly discovered mitotic regulators at all stages
of mitosis. Further, to elucidate important protein interactions and molecular pathways, in vitro and in vivo
contacts of known and novel mitotic regulators will be mapped through established methods (e.g.
immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy) and through application of new innovations such as microscale
thermophoresis and mammalian two-hybrid analysis. Specific projects include characterization of established
and newly implicated mitotic regulators, investigation of a novel mechanism of chromosome instability in induced
pluripotent stem cells, and evaluation of the causes and consequences of “cohesion fatigue,” a spontaneous,
progressive loss of source of chromosome structure in cells stalled at metaphase."

The overall goal of this application is to better understand and harness group 3 innate lymphocyte (ILC3) biology
to enhance mucosal immune responses to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). We lack fully effective
treatments for this pathogen and there is critical need to better understand how C. difficile interacts with our
immune system. ILC3s are rare immune cells localized within mucosal tissues that help protect against bacterial
infections, including C. difficile. Upon activation, ILC3s secrete high levels of the cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22)
which is a critical regulator of tissue responses during inflammation. Our recent published study shows that a
major virulence factor of C. difficile, toxin B (TcdB), directly activates ILC3s. Furthermore, work from others has
shown that administration of recombinant IL-22 provides protection in a mouse CDI model suggesting that
boosting the cytokine over its naturally produced levels during infection could aid CDI patients. Therefore, we
are investigating the molecular pathways in ILC3s important for activation to identify novel pathways to enhance
function. One family of pathways of great interest is cellular metabolism. Our preliminary data show that
polyamines positively regulate TcdB-mediated activation of ILC3s. Polyamine levels are increased in activated
ILC3s and when the key biosynthesis enzyme is inhibited, ILC3s produce less IL-22. Polyamines are important
in transcription and translation, have important roles in activation of other immune cells and have yet to be fully
investigated in ILC3s. The central hypothesis is that polyamine biology is important for ILC3 activation, and
polyamines can be leveraged for improving outcomes to C. difficile infection and/or recurrence. In this proposal
we will examine how a metabolic pathway controls ILC3 activation, which has translatable implications on these
immune cells in C. difficile infection. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Determine the mechanism(s) of polyamine function in C. difficile-activated ILC3s and 2) Determine how to
leverage polyamine biology in primary and recurrent CDI. Under the first aim, we will undertake targeted and
untargeted approaches to determine the cellular pathway(s) that polyamines target in C. difficile-mediated ILC3
activation. The second aim will test how polyamines can be targeted in vivo to boost the innate immune response
and thereby prevent or reduce CDI severity in primary or recurrent disease. Upon completion of these aims, the
expected outcomes are two-fold as we will (1) gain an understanding of fundamental immunology of how
polyamines regulate ILC3 activation and (2) determine the translatable potential of how polyamines can be
leveraged during CDI to boost immunity. These results will have a positive impact on our understanding of
immune responses to C. difficile as they will provide strong evidence-based rationale for further development of
ILC3 and IL-22 biology targeted therapies for CDI patients."

Cocaine use is a serious and growing concern for public wellbeing, yet there is no FDA-approved treatment
option for individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD), making it a critical unmet need. CUD is a complex
disorder that is influenced by many external factors, such as stress. Despite the prevalence of stress
throughout human populations, including individuals with CUD, most pre-clinical addiction research does not
examine the impact of stress during drug intake. To understand how stress and drug intake interact to
influence behavioral and neurobiological outcomes, we developed a rat model of cocaine self-administration
(SA) that combines repeated stress at the time of cocaine self-administration in rats. This model causes an
escalation of cocaine intake in otherwise stable responding rats and a long-lasting enhancement of cocaine-
seeking behavior. We propose that this behavioral shift is regulated by changes in the endocannabinoid (eCB)
system, which uniquely regulates stress and reward systems. In support of this, systemic administration of a
cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) antagonist attenuates cocaine-induced reinstatement only in rats with a history
of stress. Furthermore, my preliminary data localizes this effect to the prelimbic cortex (PLc), a key site for
regulation of stress and drug-seeking behavior. Importantly, eCB signaling, through attenuation of local
inhibitory neurotransmission, is well-positioned to regulate PLc pyramidal neuron activity and output. One such
PLc output is to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which has been shown to regulate cocaine-seeking
behavior. Therefore, this proposal tests the hypothesis that stress and cocaine-evoked changes in eCB
signaling during cocaine SA permits enhanced cocaine seeking via disinhibition of the PLc to NAcc circuit.
First, this proposal will use PLc-directed CB1R pharmacological manipulation to assess the role of eCB
signaling in cocaine-primed reinstatement for rats with a history of cocaine SA and/or repeated stress. Next,
we will use in vivo fiber photometry to record activity of the PLc→NAcc circuit during cocaine-primed
reinstatement in rats with a history of stress or no stress. This will allow us to measure the individual or
combined impact of a history of cocaine SA and/or repeated stress on cocaine-seeking behavior. Finally, using
in situ hybridization, we will examine how cocaine SA and/or repeated stress produce long-term changes in the
molecular machinery regulating eCB signaling at the PLc→NAcc circuit. These studies will expand our
knowledge of stress-drug interactions and may yield new treatment options in individuals with CUD for whom
stress is a predominant contributing factor."

Central to the development of medicine is organic chemistry and catalysis as it has permitted the
discovery of new reactions and methods for the synthesis of key pharmaceutical components that will
play a critical role in continuing the advancement of modern medicine. With the high presence of
nitrogen atoms in drug candidates due to their high biological activity, it is crucial to develop new and
innovative methods to synthesize and functionalize nitrogen-containing molecules. Recently, reactive
titanium intermediates were used to explore second insertions of unsaturated species yielding useful
nitrogen heterocycles. This proposal will focus on developing an efficient and one-step atom-
economical Ti-catalyzed multicomponent, cascading hydroaminoalkylation reaction to produce β-
cycloalkyl amines from dienes and amine/aniline substrates. This methodology has potential to be a
valuable synthetic tool because β-cycloalkyl amines products are scaffolds present in pharmaceutical
compounds such as cyclopentamine and propylhexedrine and in M3 muscarinic antagonist.
Additionally, this method will provide a fundamental understanding of this new reaction class that can
be extended into other cascading reactions to rapidly build molecule complexity."

Aging is the main risk factor for a variety of brain diseases, such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.
Additionally, recovery from stroke and other types of brain injury declines with age. There is an unmet need for
the development of more effective therapies centered on aging to counter the decline in repair capacity and the
onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The adult brain contains neurogenic stem cell niches that have the
potential to generate new progeny that migrate to distal sites, which could play a critical role for repair in age-
related disease and injury. During aging, neural stem cells show a progressive loss in their ability to proliferate
and give rise to new neurons (neurogenesis), and this is accompanied with a decline in repair ability. However,
the mechanisms underlying this deficit are not well understood. My preliminary findings suggest that aging
leads to changes in cell migration and adhesion abilities in neural stem cells, with activated neural stem cells
and their progeny becoming less migratory with age. Based on these findings, my specific hypothesis is that
with age, activated neural stem cells undergo reversible changes in cell migration and adhesion that lead to
decreased neurogenesis. My proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the age-related decline in
migration in activated neural stem cells and uncover therapeutic strategies to mitigate this.
Aim 1 will identify specific genes and regulatory factors that underlie the migratory defect in old activated
neural stem cells and perturb them to boost the migration of old cells.
Aim 2 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of blocking a signaling pathway that is important for regulation of
cell migration and adhesion for repair upon stroke injury and explore the mechanisms by which it does so.
Together, these independent aims will contribute to the field by giving a mechanistic understanding of how age
causes a decline in neural stem cell function through dysregulation in cell migration and adhesion as well as
provide a potential therapeutic avenue for improving neurogenesis and recovery from stroke in old brains.
Through this work, I will be trained in the field of aging and neural stem cells as well as gain diverse expertise
in cutting-edge experimental approaches. My scientific training coupled with mentoring by physician-scientists
will help me in building a career as a physician-scientist interested in brain aging and treating patients with
neurological diseases."

Cancer cells exploit multiple metabolic strategies to generate biosynthetic precursors that fuel malignant
proliferation. Such metabolic redundancy and plasticity hampers effectiveness of therapies that target cancer
cell metabolism and underscores the importance of identifying tumor types most likely to respond to metabolic
inhibitors. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that tumors with impaired metabolic pathways will
have limited metabolic plasticity in generating critical biosynthetic intermediates, rendering them susceptible to
metabolic inhibition. We focus on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is a central metabolic hub that
supports cell growth and yet is truncated or impaired in several forms of human renal cell cancer (RCC). A
subset of RCC tumors arise from germline deficiencies in core TCA cycle enzymes succinate dehydrogenase
(SDH) or fumarate hydratase (FH); more commonly, RCC tumors have hyperactive hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF) signaling that blunts TCA cycle metabolism. The goal of this proposal is to determine whether these
RCC tumors with altered TCA cycle activity are dependent upon ATP citrate lyase (ACL) as an
alternative source of critical metabolic intermediates. Aspartate, synthesized from TCA cycle intermediate
oxaloacetate, supports nucleotide and protein synthesis and has emerged as a critical limitation for tumor
growth. Nevertheless, how tumors with impaired TCA cycle flux sustain aspartate generation—and whether
these compensatory pathways represent a targetable liability—remains largely unknown. My preliminary data
demonstrate that SDH/FH-deficient or HIF-active RCC cells have reduced aspartate pools relative to their
isogenic controls and that ACL inhibition selectively impairs survival of these cells with defective TCA cycle
metabolism. In Aim 1, I will leverage a panel of isogenic RCC lines to test whether genetic and pharmacologic
ACL inhibition specifically impairs growth of SDH-/FH-deficient RCC cells in vitro and in vivo. I will exploit
genetic tools that supply intracellular aspartate to test the hypothesis that aspartate provision underlies the
ACL requirement in SDH-/FH-deficient cells. In Aim 2, I will use RCC cells with hyperactive HIF driven by loss
of the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor to determine whether cells with suppressed oxidative TCA cycle
activity depend on ACL to produce aspartate and enable growth in vitro and in vivo. These studies will shed
light not only on a potential metabolic Achilles heel in SDH-/FH-/VHL-null tumors but will also serve as proof of
principle that cancer cells with TCA cycle dysfunction engage ACL as an alternative route of synthesizing
anabolic precursors. The work and training plan outlined in this proposal will be completed in the laboratory of
Dr. Lydia Finley with the co-advisement of Dr. Ross Levine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and will
ideally prepare the applicant for further clinical training and a career as an independent physician-scientist."

The Administrative Core of the San Antonio-based Collaborative Research Center on
Coccidioidomycosis (SA-CCRC) will provide essential management and supervision of the
entire range of the Center’s highly multidisciplinary activities to ensure that our specific aims and
component plans are implemented effectively and efficiently. In this core, we outline a
management, coordination and integration framework for the scientific, logistical, financial,
evaluative, and compliance oversight requirements and resource allocation for the cores and
individual research projects. The ultimate goal of this administrative core is to maximize the
impact of overall research activities across the entire SA-CRCC. Within this Administrative Core,
we have designed a framework for assessing the proposed activities of each Core such that we
can ensure progress towards meeting our stated goals. SA-CCRC is designed specifically to
have well-coordinated research that can maximize and leverage resources at each of the
participating institutions. In addition, the Administrative Core will manage the Development and
Research Program (DRP) for pilot funding and mentoring of junior investigators as well as
researchers new to the field of coccidioidomycosis research. We propose the following specific
aims around which we have designed our management processes: Aim 1. To provide scientific
and programmatic leadership, administrative support, and fiscal oversight of the San Antonio-
based Collaborative Research Center on Coccidioidomycosis. Aim 2. To establish and manage
an effective Development and Research Program (DRP) for pilot funding and mentoring of
junior investigators and those new to the coccidioidomycosis field. In summary, through the
Administrative Core we will ensure successful achievement of our program mission by serving
as the central hub responsible for overall program management, resource allocation, logistical
planning, coordination, and oversight of the San Antonio Collaborative Research Center on
coccidioidomycosis. The administrative activities within this core are complemented by a robust
mentoring and professional development program aimed at preparing the next generation of
independent scientists in the field of coccidioidomycosis research."
10753493,"Summary (Core 1)
High-throughput screening (HTS) has become the cornerstone of modern drug discovery both in Industry and
Academia, allowing for the implementation of large-scale screening campaigns where thousands of
compounds can be tested in search for novel drugs against a given disease. However, the overwhelming
majority of existing HTS facilities and specialized equipment are set up in laboratories under low biosafety level
(BSL) conditions. This makes it impossible to implement this approach for highly pathogenic microorganisms,
such as Coccidioides spp., since work with these pathogens needs to be conducted inside high level
biocontainment facilities. Thus, the overarching goal of this Drug Screening Core is to establish unique
capabilities within BSL-3 conditions, which will allow for the implementation of fast, efficient and economical
HTS techniques for large-scale screening of chemical libraries for the identification of novel anti-coccidioidal
agents. More specifically, we propose to: i) develop low- and high-density microtiter plate-based models for
Coccidioides spp. susceptibility testing amenable to HTS inside our BSL-3 facility, and ii) to fully develop a
novel fungal cytological profiling (FCP) system based on imaging flow cytometry (IFC), and adapt it for drug
screening and to determine the mode of action of novel drugs. Within the CCRC, this Core will support the
screening and fungal cytological profiling activities in Project 1, provide services for down-selection of top
candidates for in vivo evaluation in Project 2, and support Project 3 activities examining immunotherapeutic
efficacy of antifungal drugs and vaccine candidates. Furthermore, once fully established, the technical
capabilities of this Core will be provided to the Coccidioides scientific community at large, as well as to others
in the field of Medical Mycology, and potentially other investigators working with BSL-3 organisms."
10753494,"Summary (Project 1)
Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides posadasii and Coccidioides immitis. It is
estimated that 150,000 new infections occur in the United States each year. The incidence of this infection
continues to rise in endemic regions. There is an urgent need for the development of better therapeutic drugs
against coccidioidomycosis. Currently, the management of coccidioidomycosis includes antifungal agents such
as amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole. However, their toxicity and side effects, and concerns over
the rise of azole-resistant clinical isolates point to an urgent need to develop new agents to combat this
disease. In this project, we propose to screen repurposing libraries in search for drugs with novel activity
against parasitic spherules of C. posadasii, and to apply our newly developed fungal cytological profiling (FCP)
methodology for the identification of potential anti-CM drug candidates. Coccidioides spp. have a unique
dimorphic life cycle characterized by the conversion of arthroconidia to spherules to enter parasitic phase.
Using spherules to screen drug library is more medically relevant compare to saprobic spores/hyphae.
Alteration of critical factor and phenotype (e.g. isotropic growth, cell wall integrity, cell wall remodeling, multi-
nuclear formation) associated with coccidioidal parasitic cycle development can be assessed by FCP for initial
drug library screening and later for drug cellular action discovery. Lead compounds from the drug library
screening will be characterized in vitro for their antifungal activity against relevant clinical Coccidioides isolates
of both C. posadasii and C. immitis, including azole-resistant strains. Subsequent in vivo antifungal efficacy will
be conducted using our newly developed Galleria mellonella model of coccidioidomycosis, which provides a
robust and cost-effective pre-screening system before testing in a more laborious, time-consuming and
expensive rodent models. The leading compounds will be further characterized to gain insights into their
molecular mechanisms of action. Global transcriptomic analyses will identify putative drug-targeted
genes/pathways, which will be further assessed by gene-specific deletion and complementation. This
molecular assessment will be complemented by fungal phenotypic analyses including microscopy (confocal,
TEM) and FCP to gain further insights into the mode of action of each drug candidate. The goal is to identify at
least 4 leading repositionable compounds at the completion of this project for advancing to preclinical
development for chemotherapy against coccidioidomycosis."
10753496,"Coccidioidomycosis is an invasive fungal infection that is caused by Coccidioides species and is increasing in
the US. Fluconazole is the drug most frequently used for mild to moderate infection. Decreased susceptibility
of Coccidioides isolates to fluconazole was documented in >37% of isolates in a large in vitro study by our
group. This raises the question of whether fluconazole, a drug frequently used against these infections, or
other azoles should be utilized in those situations. The objective of Project 2 is to evaluate the in vivo and
clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the azole antifungals and evaluate the efficacy of alternative
therapeutic strategies to treat CNS and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. The ultimate goal of these studies is to
provide data that may help guide clinical therapy and improve the outcomes of patients with
coccidioidomycosis. To achieve this objective, we will determine the in vivo significance of decreased
Coccidioides susceptibility to azole antifungals using murine models of CNS and pulmonary
coccidioidomycosis (Aim 1). Both Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii isolates with different in vitro
fluconazole susceptibilities will be used in established murine models of CNS and pulmonary infections.
Treatment efficacy with azoles will be compared for azole-susceptible and azole-resistant clinical isolates in
order to determine the significance of in vitro resistance on in vivo response. We will also determine the in vivo
effectiveness of novel compounds against CNS and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis caused by azole-resistant
isolates (Aim 2). Azole-resistant C. immitis and C. posadasii isolates will be used to evaluate different
therapeutic approaches in the CNS and pulmonary models of coccidioidomycosis. This will include the
evaluation of novel compounds identified in Project 1 and the Drug Screening Core with in vitro or in vivo
activity against wild-type Coccidioides isolates. Promising candidates will be tested in combination with
promising vaccine strategies in Project 3. Finally, we assess the correlation between in vitro susceptibility to
fluconazole and other azoles and clinical outcomes over time in patients with coccidioidomycosis (Aim 3).
Patients infected with fluconazole susceptible (MIC <8 g/ml) and resistant (MIC >32 g/ml) Coccidioides
isolates will be identified from a clinical susceptibility database. Retrospective reviews of medical histories will
be conducted to determine responses to fluconazole and other azole therapy and these will be correlated with
in vitro susceptibility results. Other variables that will be assessed will include host factors, extent of disease,
and other factors that may influence clinical outcomes. Changes in azole MIC patterns over time will also be
measured to determine whether reduced susceptibility is a continuing problem. The results of Project 2 will
further our understanding of the relationship between in vitro antifungal resistance of Coccidioides isolates to
antifungals and in vivo responses and clinical outcomes in coccidioidomycosis."
10753501,"Project Summary
An estimated 350,000 people in the United States become infected with Coccidioides annually. There is an
unmet need to develop better chemotherapies and a vaccine for active immunization and/or immunotherapy
against coccidioidomycosis (CM). We have previously created a recombinant chimeric polypeptide antigen
(rCpa1) composed of the most immunogenic fragments of 3 previously identified Coccidioides antigens and 5
human T-cell epitopes. The bacterial-expressed rCpa1 is loaded into yeast glucan-chitin particles (GCPs) to
create GCP-rCpa1 protein vaccine. The latter stimulates a robust Th1 and Th17 response and confers
protection for human MHC II-expressing HLA-DR4 transgenic mice against a lethal pulmonary infection with
both species of Coccidioides. The challenges to advance a protein vaccine to clinical readiness are to produce
high quantity and quality of the rCpa1 antigen and to validate human immune response to the vaccine. In this
project, we propose to create two types of formulation methods using mRNA and vector-based delivery and
adjuvant systems. The vaccine recepients will express the coccidioidal antigen in vivo to prime their own
immune system. Our central hypothesis is that an optimized rCpa-1-based vaccine using an mRNA or vector
delivery/adjuvant platform will stimulate robust Th1 and Th17 immunity against CM. These two delivery
platforms can be easily scaled up to produce safe vaccines for preclinical and clinical testing. The GCP-rCpa1
protein vaccine will be used as a benchmark for comparison. There are 3 specific aims. Aim 1: We will design
DNA constructs for in vitro transcription of mRNAs that encode Coccidioides rCpa1 antigen. IVT-mRNAs will
be loaded into GCPs to create GCP-rCpa1-mRNA vaccines. The second approach will create a vector-based
vaccine using a Francisella novicida mutant (Fn-iglD). Wild typle Fn rarely causes tularemia, while F. tularensis
(Ft) is highly virulent. Fn-iglD is highly attenuated and it protects both rats and macaques againt a lethal
pulmonary Ft infection. Fn-iglD also elictis a mixed Th1/Th17 immunity and it is currently under formulation for
clinical safety trial. We will create a Fn-iglD-rCpa1 vaccine. The antigen expression levels of these platforms
and their capacity to stimulate cytokine production in human monoctyic THP-1 cells and murine macrophages
will be determined. Aim 2: The newly created vaccines that show both good antigen expression and capable of
eliciting cytokine production will be further evaluated for their efficacy, immune correlates and protective
mecahnisms. We will apply the HLA-DR4 murine model of CM and human blood cells to delineate immune
correlates and protective mechanisms using a global immune gene profiling method and confirmed with
immiunlogical methods in our laboratories. Aim3: We will establish a murine immunotherapy model of CM for
evaluating treatment efficacy of the most protective vaccine alone or in combination with an azole or the newly
identified drugs in Project #1 and Project #2."

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes host defense, cell survival and tissue
regeneration under homeostatic condition However, if dysregulated and overexpressed, TNF is a major driver
of chronic inflammation. Excessive TNF production in the gastrointestinal tract targets the epithelium, drives
increased cell death, and is sufficient to elicit substantial tissue inflammation and chronic disease. Blockade of
TNF is a widely utilized biologic that provides therapeutic benefit in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) patients. Despite this knowledge, the mechanisms that control the beneficial versus detrimental roles of
TNF in the intestine are poorly defined. The fundamental focus of this proposal is to mechanistically
define a novel pathway that protects the intestine from TNF-driven damage and inflammation. In
recently published and new preliminary data, we have determined that group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s)
are essential to protect the intestinal epithelium from TNF-driven damage and inflammation. Surprisingly, this
did not occur via traditional effector pathways, and rather involved production of prostaglandins and growth
factors. These data provoke a fundamental hypothesis that ILC3s are essential to shape the protective versus
pathologic roles of TNF in the intestine, and this balance is disrupted in human IBD where ILC3s are known to
become dysregulated. We will mechanistically test this hypothesis by asking the following specific questions:
(1) How does ILC3 production of sensing of prostaglandins impact intestinal health and inflammation? And (2)
What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ILC3-derived HB-EGF augments intestinal immunity
and protects the gut from TNF? Finally, we will directly translate our findings from basic mouse models into
samples from IBD patients. Results from these experiments will pave the way for a greater understanding of
TNF-driven intestinal damage and inflammation, which could provoke novel preventative, therapeutic or
curative strategies for multiple chronic inflammatory diseases."

It became well known that the immune suppressive niche inside the tumor microenvironment
(TME) accounts for tumor immune escape and progression, in which the regulatory T cells (Tregs)
play an important role. Although some progress has been made in identifying transcriptional and
epigenetic events in Treg functional regulation in TME, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding the detailed epigenetic networks mediating Treg survival, expansion and
enhanced immune suppressive function induced by TME. Vacuolar protein sorting 72 homolog
(VPS72), a histone chaperone that recognizes and exchanges histone H2A.Z for standard histone
H2A, has been shown in in vitro studies that regulate gene transcriptions especially related in
mitochondrial metabolism through chromatin remodeling, although the in vivo biological function
of VPS72 remains unknown. Our preliminary studies revealed the higher expression and positive
correlation between VPS72 and Foxp3 in the Tregs inside the TME. Intriguingly, our Treg-specific
VPS72 KO and H2A.Z KO mouse models showed normal thymic Treg development, but
dramatically interrupted peripheral Treg maintenance and function. These results led to our
central hypothesis that VPS72 is a critical epigenetic factor that can be induced by TME factors
and enhance Treg stability and function through H2A.Z chromatin remodeling of Treg in the TME.
In the proposed studies, we are using Treg-specific constitutive and inducible gene deletion
mouse models to determine the role of VPS72 and H2AZ in peripheral Treg cell maintenance,
stability and function in the cancer. Using combined scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and CUT & RUN-
seq multi-omic analysis, we will delineate the epigenetic strategies and detailed molecular
mechanisms and signaling pathways VPS72 used in controlling Treg homeostasis and function.
In transplant and spontaneous melanoma tumor models, we will evaluate the anti-tumor effects
of VPS72 and H2AZ suppression. Furthermore, TME factors and related molecular mechanisms
in upregulating VPS72 expression of Tregs in TME will be also investigated. Results from the
proposed study will not only enhance our understanding of Treg biology but will also facilitate the
development of more efficient Treg-based intervention strategies for cancer treatment."

Extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) are a group of heterogeneous nanoparticles that are secreted into
the extracellular milieu by many types of cells. EVPs have emerged as important mediators in cell-to-cell
communications within organs. Recent studies have suggested that EVPs might be involved in β cell-immune
cell interaction and β cell dysfunction and survival in type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, many of these studies
were performed using mouse models and not focused on human samples. Hence, there is a unmet need to
understand the contribution of human islet/pancreas-associated EVPs in T1D progression.
Here, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team, including experts in islet biology (Chen, Liu), EVP biology
(Lyden), vascular biology (Rafii), and T1D patient care (Antal), to test the hypothesis that abnormal EVPs of
pathogenic human islets and pancreatic tissues disrupt human islet function and survival and trigger
T1D progression. We have performed extensive proteomics analyses of EVPs derived from human β cell lines
cultured in T1D conditions. In addition, by comparing the plasma membrane protein profiles of human β cell line
and primary human islet-derived EVPs with an EVP proteomic database containing 426 human samples, we
have identified several plasma membrane protein candidates to isolate β cell-specific EVPs. Here, we will use
multiple platforms, including primary human islets from healthy, pre-T1D, and T1D donors, human pluripotent
stem cell (hPSC)-derived islet organoids, perfusable microfluidic devices containing vascularized islets, and
pancreatic slice culture to systematically examine the role of human islet/pancreas-associated EVPs in islet cell
function and survival during T1D progression.
In this proposal, we expect to identify membrane-bound EVP protein panels to purify EVPs from human α, β
cells, islets, and pancreatic tissue. We will define the EVP protein and RNA profiles and identify signature
molecules associated with islet status during T1D progression. Moreover, we will systemically dissect the roles
of human islet/pancreas EVPs in human β cell function and survival, as well as their role in the crosstalk between
β cells and peri-islet cell niche. Overall, this study will facilitate the identification of novel “biomarkers” for T1D
diagnosis and guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent the progression of T1D."

Healthy subjects rapidly shift their attention in response to a dynamic sensory environment and
changing cognitive demands. Failure to quickly shift perceptual resources between auditory and
other modalities has been hypothesized to be a core deficit in both dyslexia and autism. Precisely
how the brain shuttles information between sensory systems is not known, but recent work
suggests that the thalamus contains circuits that have the capacity to rapidly transition between
different sensory modalities. Specifically, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a thin shell of
GABAergic neurons surrounding the thalamus, may serve as a link to allow communication
between different areas of the sensory thalamus, a phenomenon we refer to as thalamic “cross-
talk.” Based on recent data and our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that thalamo-TRN-
thalamic circuits provide critical connections between thalamic nuclei and therefore permit rapid
switching between auditory and other thalamocortical pathways. We propose to test this
hypothesis using a novel combination of anatomical, chemogenetic, optical stimulation and optical
imaging approaches in the mouse, using both slice and in vivo approaches. Specifically, we will
determine which of multiple potential circuit pathways is/are used to permit auditory, visual and
auditory thalamic nuclei to communicate with each other. Next, we will determine whether and
how such thalamic cross-talk influences synaptic responses at the level of the auditory cortex.
Finally, the impact of the TRN on cross-modal processing will be directly examined by optically
modulating the TRN while imaging cortical responses to combined sensory stimulation in awake
mice. Successful completion of this project will provide the first circuit-level characterization of the
role of the TRN in communication between the auditory thalamus and other thalamic regions. In
addition, this work will lay the groundwork for a greater understanding of how thalamoreticular
systems break down in disorders of communication."

 Low-value care is patient care that provides no net benefit in specific clinical scenarios, and often causes
harm. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia (MCID) frequently receive low-value care and
are particularly vulnerable to its harms (e.g., routine benzodiazepine drug prescriptions offer limited benefit to
adults with MCID and can cause delirium or falls). Reducing the delivery of low-value care can improve health
outcomes for this vulnerable group by lessening exposure to harms as well as curtailing unnecessary
spending. To begin to reduce the problem of low-value care delivery in older adults with MCID, it is important to
understand the extent of the national problem, identify the characteristics of patients and the delivery systems
with the greatest risk exposure, and whether two currently implemented U.S. strategies (payment reform and a
large education campaign) were associated with less delivery of low-value care among older adults with MCID.
In this context, we propose three specific aims: 1) to generate national estimates of low-value care trends,
costs, and harms in older adults with MCID (2008–2018), 2) to identify subgroups of older adults with MCID at
the greatest risk of receiving low-value care, and 3) to assess whether two U.S. strategies were associated
with less low-value care delivered to older adults with MCID.
 We propose to achieve these aims by linking Medicare claims data with the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), which is a nationally representative longitudinal study of community-dwelling and institutionalized older
Americans on the health and economic changes of aging. We will pursue these aims using national
longitudinal data and by applying rigorous analytical approaches such as interrupted time series methods with
contemporaneous control groups. Ultimately, we seek to build a foundation of evidence to inform future U.S.
health policies that can reduce low-value care and improve patient-oriented outcomes in older Americans with
MCID."

Early detection of cancer provides one of the most effective ways to reduce cancer related
morbidity and mortality. However, most malignancies including brain and head and neck
cancers do not have effective minimally invasive strategies for early detection. Unfortunately,
early detection is hindered by several factors, including the lack of suitable tests and cost. One
of the chief challenges in developing non-invasive tests is the identification of the appropriate
biofluid and specific markers. While blood-based testing has shown promise, many cancers are
not easily detected in the circulation. Over the past two decades, DNA released from cancer
cells has emerged as a specific biomarker of cancer. We have previously developed sensitive
methods for the simultaneous detection of multiple DNA based analytes from a small quantity of
starting material in a variety of biospecimens. We have extensive preliminary results that
biofluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and saliva, associated with certain cancers are
significantly enriched in released tumor DNA (rtDNA) compared to blood. In addition, our group
has an ongoing relationship with an industrial partner to translate our promising technology into
the clinical realm. This proposal will build on those strengths to develop assays for the
sensitive and specific detection of brain and head and neck cancer in CSF and saliva,
respectively. A non-plasma based “liquid biopsy” approach for the earlier detection of cancers
difficult to detect in the blood would represent a significant medical advance."
10929472,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Computed tomography (CT) is currently the most sensitive test for detecting preclinical lung cancer. The
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that routine low-dose CT screening reduces lung cancer
mortality by 20% relative to chest radiography. However, the increased use of CT has also resulted in the
discovery of an estimated 2 million screened and incidentally detected indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs).
These nodules, less than 30 mm in diameter, are largely benign but a proportion possess malignancy potential.
Methods are urgently needed to better differentiate between individuals with benign disease and those should
undergo invasive diagnostic testing.
 Liquid biopsy has found its way into the cancer lexicon as a reference to tumor biomarkers within blood or
other readily accessible biospecimens that reflect the presence and biology of cancer. To fully mature liquid
biopsy at the forefront of early cancer assessment, two frontiers must be addressed. The first is the development
(discovery and validation) of comprehensive personalized cancer-specific omics targets for early detection. The
second is the advancement and refinement of technologies that can detect the earliest shedding of these
circulating targets. This application is Phase 2 of the EFIRM-Liquid Biopsy Research Laboratory (E-LBRL) aims
to advance these two essential frontiers for early cancer assessment of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs):
early detection of lung cancer.
 Our partnership interweaves the expertise of lung cancer biologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians with
industry engineers, converging on the novel liquid biopsy technology “EFIRM-Liquid biopsy (eLB)”.
Complementary to the performance of eLB, during the Phase 1 of E-LBRL, we have discovered a novel species
of cell-free DNA which are ultrashort and single-stranded (uscfDNA) and contribute to a population of a large
pool of Broad Range cfDNA (BRcfDNA). Unlike circulating tumor DNA which are rare or absent in early states,
the uscfDNA represent global/systemic changes in cancer and can be harnessed to detect the malignancy
status of the IPN. Additionally, due to their physical characteristics, these BRcfDNA biomarkers are optimal for
the eLB platform.
 We hypothesize that signals from malignancy associated BRcfDNAs can be integrated with malignancy
associated somatic mutations, differentiated methylated regions, miRNA and radiomic imaging in an integrated
model termed IPN.CA to permit the earliest cancer assessment of IPN. Our industry partner together with a
Biomarker Reference Lab will convert individual eLB assays to multiplex arrays for CLIA-qualification. The eLB-
IPN.CA and its associated inputs will be a clinically deployable Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) for early cancer
assessment in IPN."

Ischemic stroke leads to a loss of blood flow to the brain and is a prominent cause of death and disability in
affected individuals. Whereas neuroprotective agents have shown limited clinical benefits for treatment of stroke,
vascular interventions are promising targets for therapy. Nevertheless, restoration of bloodflow following these
treatments is often incomplete. Surprisingly, the role of vascular survival and function within the injured tissue
following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is largely unexplored. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)
depolarization and increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ are key signaling events in cell death, but the effects of
targeting vascular mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and ΔΨm depolarization on neuronal outcomes is unknown. Upon
reperfusion following ischemia, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages surrounding neuronal
and vascular tissues. In resistance arteries of mice, posterior cerebral artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are
more susceptible than endothelial cells (ECs) to cell death induced by oxidative stress imposed by H2O2.
Furthermore, vascular cells from females are more resilient to mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptosis to H2O2
compared to males. However, the mechanisms mediating this protection in females is unknown. To address this
gap in knowledge, the Specific Aims of this project will test the central hypothesis that sex-based differences in
mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and ΔΨm regulation underly greater vascular cell resilience to acute oxidative stress
in PCAs of female vs. male mice. To investigate these relationships, sex differences in mitochondrial Ca2+
signaling and ΔΨm depolarization during exposure to H2O2 (200 μM for 50 min) will be evaluated in isolated,
pressurized cerebral arteries and native endothelial tubes (Aim 1). Complimentary experiments will test the
effects of Ca2+ channel signaling induced by acute oxidative stress on mitochondrial Ca2+ and ΔΨm
depolarization. The proposal will additionally examine how differences in electron transport function and reverse
activation of ATP synthase between males and females contribute to greater cell death in males (Aim 2). Using
a middle cerebral artery occlusion model, experiments will evaluate the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and
ΔΨm depolarization to arterial damage in males and females following I/R in vivo (Aim 3). These findings will be
correlated to neuronal survival and behavioral deficits, to gain further understanding to how vascular survival can
improve neuronal outcomes. Gaining new understanding of how to target intrinsic mechanisms of protection
inherent to females to promote vascular resilience in the cerebral circulation following I/R injury to the brain will
yield new insight into preserving vascular function and associated neuronal outcomes. Such findings provide
foundational knowledge regarding sex differences in vascular mitochondrial function and will facilitate the
development of novel avenues for therapy targeting the vasculature for patients after stroke and other conditions
of oxidative stress in the brain such as traumatic brain injury."

Parasitic nematodes colonize over a billion people worldwide and are associated with a range of maladies.
Among these parasites, the whipworm Trichuris trichiura is particularly difficult to manage with existing
medication that target adult worms due to drug resistance and frequency of reinfection. Following ingestion by
the host, Trichuris eggs hatch in the gastrointestinal tract where they mature into adulthood and produce eggs,
which are then deposited back into the environment in feces to perpetuate the cycle. As such, the entire time the
parasite inhabits the host is spent in the presence of a diverse community of bacteria that are part of the gut
microbiota. We and others have shown that colonization by Trichuris trichiura and the model parasite Trichuris
muris restructures intestinal bacterial communities in humans and mice, respectively. Consistent with
interactions between parasitic nematodes and the gut microbiota, bacteria are required for T. muris to complete
its life cycle in mice due to a role for bacteria in promoting egg hatching. The details of how the gut microbiota
mediate egg hatching and the reproductive fitness of Trichuris remain obscure.
In preliminary results, we identified bacteria that differentially affect T. muris egg hatching and established a
novel C. elegans screen to identify bacterial gene products that have a conserved role in the reproductive fitness
of free-living and parasitic nematodes. The main objective of this proposal is to identify mechanisms by which
bacteria mediate Trichuris egg hatching and affect subsequent colonization of the host. First, based on our
findings that T. muris and C. elegans share a requirement for an arginine-dependent byproduct of E. coli, we will
identify this metabolite and determine how it impacts host reproduction using the two nematode models. We will
specifically test the hypothesis that polyamines are the key arginine-dependent factors in this system. Then, we
will delve deeper into how bacteria-egg interactions mediate hatching by determining the role of chitinase
produced by the parasite and compare bacterial species that promote versus impede hatching. Lastly, we will
determine whether bacteria displaying superior egg-hatching activity enhance T. muris infection of mice, and
using a new assay we developed for T. trichiura, extend our observations to the human parasite. We believe
these innovative approaches will improve our understanding of how parasites have adapted to their host
environment, and ultimately reveal vulnerabilities in the Trichuris life cycle that can serve as therapeutic targets."

This NIH Stage 1B study (9) will advance development of an intervention, STELLA-FTD (Support via
Technology: Living and Learning with Advancing FTD), that is designed to address the needs of the
approximately 50,000 family members in the US caring for someone with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The
STELLA-FTD intervention is framed by foundational research and informed by rehabilitative and nursing
science. This study is important for two reasons. First, it addresses an important gap in care partner
behavioral interventions. FTD is the most common dementia in persons under age 65, and one of the hallmark
symptoms of FTD is distressing behaviors; yet, few behavior-focused interventions exist for FTD care
partners. This study tests the preliminary efficacy of STELLA-FTD in reducing care partner burden related to
the behavioral symptoms that come with FTD (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, agitation). Second this study tests the
mechanism of action of the well-known ABC behavioral change technique. The ABC analytic approach
involves identifying a behavior, then the behavior's activators and consequences. This approach is well-known
in the caregiving world and research has demonstrated positive results in reducing care partner burden, but
none has isolated the essential components of the ABC analytic approach. This limits future research and,
importantly, scaling to community-based use. Upon completion of this study, should the hypotheses be proven,
STELLA-FTD efficacy will be documented and the mechanism of action will be explained. This information will
be the foundation for future NIH Stage 2 testing of STELLA-FTD.
 This 36-week randomized controlled (RCT), two-group, repeated measures trial with FTD family
care partners will evaluate whether training in the use of the ABC analytic approach (test) reduces
burden when compared to a dose-matched psychoeducational curriculum (control). This design
allows for examination of the mechanism of action of STELLA-FTD by isolating the active component to
determine its relationship with self-efficacy and care partner burden. The specific aims include testing of
a) the intervention to assess preliminary efficacy, b) the mechanism of action and c) the mediating
effect of self-efficacy on burden. In addition to testing STELLA-FTD, we will standardize materials and
fidelity protocols to prepare the intervention for future NIH Stage 2 testing. We will test STELLA-FTD with
300 care partners. Both groups (n=150/group) will receive education about FTD and peer support. The test
group will receive specific instruction in the ABC analytic approach, the control group will not. Efficacy will be
assessed measuring burden between and within groups using Teri's Revised Memory and Behavior Problems
Checklist (18). The key components of the mechanism of action will be isolated using the randomized design,
with pre- and post-assessments of burden and self-efficacy of all participants. The data analysis will examine
burden between and within groups, controlling for diagnosis type and demographic data."

10757392,"Project Summary
Mammalian cells have evolved multiple non-overlapping mechanisms to ensure that DNA replication initiates
from origins of replications once and only once in each division cycle; loss of control over these mechanisms
induces genomic instability, an important driver of malignant transformation. Increasing evidence suggests that
origin utilization and activation in higher eukaryotes is influenced by epigenetic factors, but exact mechanisms
are largely undefined. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms that control replication
initiation in mammalian cells and to understand how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes genomic
instability. The histone methyltransferase SET8 is emerging as a key regulator of replication initiation in
mammalian cells through its mono-methyltransferase activity on histone H4K20. The cell cycle regulated enzyme
is essential for origin licensing in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but is proteolytically degraded in S-phase; blocking
this step triggers reiterative replication initiation within the same cell cycle or re-replication. Both SET8 and
H4K20me, however, are also involved in transcriptional repression and in the repair of DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs), but whether these seemingly independent activities play a role in replication initiation or re-replication is
not known. Most importantly, little to nothing is known about the nature or characteristics of the re-replication
products that accumulate in cells with defective SET8 degradation, nor is there information on where in the
genome re-replication occurs or if certain genomic regions are more prone to re-replication induction. Our new
results show that re-replication resulting from defective SET8 degradation is not a stochastic process, with few
genomic sites exhibit large and significant copy number gains, reminiscent of genomic amplifications that are
seen in cancer cells. Additional preliminary studies suggest that re-replication may originate from DNA double
strand breaks (DSBs) that may spontaneously arise during replication, and requires the activity of genes involved
both in transcriptional silencing and in DSB repair. Our innovative preliminary studies and experimental
approaches are designed to thoroughly examine this alternative model of re-replication induction. In Aim 1, we
will determine the magnitude (copy number gains) and genomic distribution of the re-replicated DNA in bulk and
single cells with defective SET8 degradation and following the induction of DSBs at defined genomic sites. We
will also test if these parameters vary in different cancer cell types and in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. In Aim 2,
we will define the roles of histone H4K20 methylation, transcriptional silencing by the H4K20me reader
L3MBTL1, and proteins involved in the repair of DSBs in effecting re-replication. The successful execution of the
proposed aims promises to increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating replication initiation in
mammalian cells, and lead to a better understanding of how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes
genomic instability."
10762447,"Summary:
Severe treatment recalcitrant atopic dermatitis (AD) is a debilitating condition with substantial population
impact. Dermatology has experienced the emergence of targeted immuno-modulating drugs (IMDs) that have
unprecedented efficacy in treating AD. Their optimal use is still unknown because their safety remains
insufficiently characterized.
A range of serious side effects are conceivable based on the immunologic pathways although it is unlikely that
they will all play out in clinical practice. Quantifying or refuting these adverse effects is critical for a clinical
benefit-risk assessment and personalized treatment decisions. Existing trials have not answered these
questions and are unlikely to address them in the near future. The resulting uncertainty has led to both overly
restrictive but also aggressive prescribing of highly efficacious IMDs and this proposal aims to close this glaring
knowledge gap.
We propose a population-based prospective drug safety monitoring system leveraging existing data sources
that shortens the time to insights and provides high validity findings through advanced causal inference
methods. Analyses of longitudinal healthcare databases cover a source population of >78 million Americans
and include commercially insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. New and urgently needed safety insights will
reflect clinical practice, including populations typically excluded from RCTs, like children, women in
reproductive age, patients with complex diseases, minority populations, and patients with existing risk factors.
The size of the claims data source increases statistical power and the linkage to electronic health records in
subsets improves clinical depth. We use causal inference methods that demonstrated high validity in pilot data
and complement them with a novel data mining approach to identify unsuspected events. Analyses are done
with highest transparency and reproducibility to support clinical decision making. This project’s finding on the
optimal use of IMDs in clinical practice will lead to more targeted prescribing and benefit large patient groups,
including populations underrepresented in RCTs: children, older adults, pregnant women, racial minorities,
patients with pre-existing infections, cancers, VTE and others.
This project is highly innovative as it will generate directly applicable clinical insights on the safe and targeted
use of new immuno-modulating drugs (IMDs) to treat atopic dermatitis. Leveraging existing claims data
sources with added EHR data it builds on novel methods for causal inference to mitigate biases arising in real-
world data analyses in dermatology. The expedited evidence generation via the proposed prospective
monitoring system combined with our track record in pharmacoepidemiologic analyses, this research will
efficiently close knowledge gaps for optimal IMD use in many underrepresented and high-risk patients."

10762464,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: During the first six months of 2020, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries used telemedicine
services compared to only 134,000 during the first six months of 2019. Telemedicine policy changes during the
COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a major transformation of ambulatory care delivery that is sustained—currently
1 out of 5 ambulatory care visits are performed through telemedicine. While state and federal agencies have
long positioned telemedicine as a means to improve health, post-pandemic telemedicine policymaking is
hindered due to the scarcity of evidence on the broad scale impact of telemedicine on healthcare access,
quality and costs. For instance, it is challenging to enact permanent telemedicine policies that facilitate the
equitable use of telemedicine without an understanding of patient, provider and market barriers that impede its
use. Furthermore, while widespread telemedicine use has the potential to improve clinical outcomes such as
preventable hospital admission rates, there is a lack of empirical data on this topic. Finally, while essential for
policymaking, the broad scale impact of telemedicine use on Medicare spending and utilization has not been
previously studied. The dramatic increase in telemedicine use as a result of healthcare policies enacted during
the COVID-19 pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to address these long-standing knowledge
gaps.
OVERALL STRATEGY: In this study, we propose using a contemporary, national cohort of Medicare
beneficiaries supplemented with detailed provider and market-level data to investigate factors associated with
telemedicine use, and the impact of telemedicine on ambulatory care outcomes and healthcare spending.
RESEARCH AIMS: 1) To identify patient, provider and market-level determinants of telemedicine use. We will
explore heterogeneity in telemedicine use across specific populations of interest, including beneficiaries that
are rurally located, elderly, racial/ethnic minorities, or socioeconomically disadvantaged. 2) To evaluate the
association between practice-level telemedicine use and hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive
conditions. 3) To evaluate the impact of clinician-level telemedicine use on 30-day total per capita costs.
IMPACT: Findings from this study will directly inform major areas of uncertainty and provide key evidence to
inform telemedicine policymaking."
10782533,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
Nutrition involves specific nutrients and foods but also complex systems within a community and
society that define what, why, how, and when a person eats. People living in poverty, and with
the many challenges linked to poverty, are more likely to experience nutritional health disparities,
such as obesity. As such, meaningful, bidirectional community engagement is critical to impactful
research that addresses persistent, complex health conditions, including those associated with
poor nutrition. However, despite its value, community engagement for many researchers is not
easy, can be uncomfortable, is often not prioritized and thus not often done. The proposed
Precision Nutrition COBRE prioritizes community engagement for all COBRE researchers, to
enable a unique community-informed approach to nutrition research. The Community
Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core will serve as the bridge for Precision Nutrition COBRE
researchers and the communities most effected by nutrition-related health conditions, in
order to foster impactful research that is feasible and relevant to local communities. The CEO
Core will be based at Hawaii’s largest federally qualified health center, with a long history of
community-based research. Led by a unique team of community-based clinical and basic
science researchers with extensive experience in participatory research, and a commitment
to working with Hawaii’s community organizations and leaders, the CEO Core will be
essential to the success of the Precision Nutrition COBRE. The Specific Aims of the CEO
Core are to 1) Facilitate researchers’ understanding of the nutrition-related priority issues and
concerns of the community, and the context in which nutrition-related health disparities
develop and persist; 2) Promote the development of meaningful, sustainable, collaborative
alliances between community stakeholders, community providers, academic researchers,
and others in an all-inclusive nurturing professional development environment; and 3)
Promote high-quality nutrition research that builds on and augments the knowledge/expertise
of communities by helping researchers to appropriately incorporate a community context into
their studies. This innovative CEO Core will provide researchers an experiential, first-hand
framework regarding Hawaii’s communities that will, in turn, support meaningful
interdisciplinary, sustainable partnerships and impactful Precision Nutrition research."

To enable Precision Nutrition, a Consortium of Research Advancement Facilities & Training (CRAFT) is
proposed that will establish new research facilities and enhance existing ones, ensuring that state-of-the-
art equipment and other essential resources are available to COBRE-funded researchers to facilitate the conduct
of high-quality, high-impact research employing cutting-edge technologies. New, emerging, and established
Cores comprising CRAFT that include Epigenomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics, Microbiomes, Nutrition,
Metabolic Phenotyping, Microscopy/Imaging, and Bioinformatics will be integrated under a unified
administrative structure, with directors of each Core forming an Executive Committee that facilitates
external evaluations and prioritizes budgets annually. This novel configuration of Cores will allow greater
resource flexibility and improved efficiency of research. Herein, we propose to establish a new Statistical
Analysis, Nutrition & Diet Core, and to expand Epigenomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics, Metabolic
Phenotyping, Microscopy/Imaging, and Bioinformatics Core Facilities. Education, training, access to
equipment and consultation are or will be readily available to investigators at the University in each of these
areas, through the expertise of highly accomplished faculty and their support staff, postdocs and junior
faculty colleagues. The Executive Committee will contract a third-party expert to measure and evaluate the
effectiveness of each of the CRAFT Cores annually to ensure relevance and value for UH investigators.
The goal of the CRAFT is to provide resources, expertise, education and training for the advancement of
meritorious biomedical research provided by the CRAFT will produce the next generation of research leaders
and mentors in the field of Precision Nutrition to ultimately benefit the people of Hawaii and the Pacific region
through improvement of health outcomes and quality of life. To achieve this goal, we aim to provide access to
the latest technologies/equipment (Aim 1), education and training (Aim 2), and consultation-based expertise

Metagenomics (Microbiomes), Microscopy/Imaging, and Bioinformatics. Collectively, the availability of the
CRAFT resources and expertise will substantively expand the direction and depth of research conducted by
researchers and collaborating groups, and increase the quality of their research, thus positioning them to
successfully attain high-impact, peer-reviewed publications and external grant support. By working with our
Community Engagement and Outreach Core, we anticipate that the research activities in the field of Precision
Nutrition will not only be relevant to community needs (e.g., health disparities that are related to deficiencies in
nutrition) but also provide a concerted mechanism to encourage community support and education in the area
of basic science, clinical, and translational research. Thus, the CRAFT is unique to Hawaii and is an essential
foundation for Precision Nutrition with far-reaching implications to health research nationally."

Children living in food-insecure homes, defined as at some time during the last year their household not having
enough food, money, or resources to feed the family experience low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables (FV),
and a trajectory for increased risk of obesity and chronic diseases in adulthood. In Hawai‘i, a higher proportion
of Native Hawaiian (NH) and other Pacific Islander (OPI) children live in food-insecure households when
compared with the state average (30% and 50%, respectively vs. 18%) and NHOPI adults suffer
disproportionately from chronic disease. Produce prescription programs, provide vouchers to individuals to
purchase fresh FV, are promising strategies to improve diet quality and reduce chronic disease risk among
food insecure populations. The long-term objective of this research is to reduce nutrition-related health
disparities via clinical-community based programming. The Keiki (child) Produce Prescription (KPRx) program
was developed and implemented by enlisting University and community researchers and health care providers
at the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC). The current study builds on the
community-academic partnership to achieve the following specific aims 1) develop and validate a quantitative,
food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for NHOPI children (HCFFQ) and 2) measure effectiveness of the KPRx
on FV intake, gut microbiome composition, and health related biomarkers in 100 parent-child dyads in the
context of household food insecurity from a predominantly NHOPI community in Hawaiʻi. An NHOPI-rich
population-specific dietary database from the Children’s Healthy Living Program study will be utilized to
develop a valid, reliable Hawaii Child Food Frequency Questionnaire (HCFFQ) (Aim 1). A community based
participatory research approach to carry out a randomized controlled trial that measures the effect of the KPRx
on child diet and microbiome, and parent/caregiver diet and health-related biomarkers on 100 parent-child
dyads in the context of household food insecurity will be conducted (Aim 2). The community-informed
research study will provide data to inform local and state healthcare and nutrition assistance programming
policies aimed at reducing food insecurity and health disparities among NHOPI and minority populations."
10782541,"Project Summary – Project 3 (Rettenmeier)
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a major health concern in the world and is fueled by
the growing pandemic of obesity and insulin resistance as a consequence of overnutrition and a more sedentary
lifestyle. Thus, improving dietary habits is crucial to reduce the risk of disease onset and progression. However,
the drivers for disease progression are not fully understood, and reliable noninvasive tools to monitor and
characterize hepatic changes are urgently needed to improve risk assessment and interventions. NAFLD is
characterized by fat accumulation in the liver and encompasses simple nonalcoholic fatty liver and the more
progressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is strongly associated with the development of fibrosis,
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The differentiation between benign NAFLD and NASH using current
noninvasive diagnostic tools remains challenging and biopsy is often needed for a definitive diagnosis. The key
histological features of NASH include the degree of steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis and is often
associated with iron overload. Among them, the stage of fibrosis has been shown to be the most reliable predictor
of liver-related mortality and presents a prominent target for the development of new imaging techniques.
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is considered the imaging gold standard which targets the increase in
extracellular matrix in fibrotic liver tissue based on stiffness measurements. Recently, multiparametric MRI (mp-
MRI) approaches have evolved that use MR relaxometry to assess the increase of extracellular fluid (ECF)
volume as a measure of fibrosis. These methods use T2* mapping to account for iron deposition which presents
a major confounding factor in the assessment of ECF volumes. Both, MRE and MRI techniques have shown
promising results, however, improvements in specificity and accuracy are still needed. Our long-term goal is to
develop a novel QSM based multiparametric MRI approach (QSMmp-MRI) that addresses shortcomings of
previous mp-MRI techniques by incorporating quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) into the method. QSM
has high specificity towards magnetically active iron compounds such as ferritin and hemosiderin and could
improve the quantification of iron load in NASH patients and thereby indirectly enhance the accuracy of the
corresponding ECF volume measurements in liver tissue. Overall, this new technique will enable the assessment
of hepatic tissue parameters such as fibrosis, inflammation, steatosis, and iron load. The objective of this
proposal is to implement the QSMmp-MRI sequences and to perform initial testing in a pilot study that uses
noninvasive MRE as reference. In Aim 1, we will develop a set of MR sequences to quantify T1, T2*, magnetic
susceptibility, and proton density fat fraction maps based on motion-robust radial sampling. Different acquisition
modes will be tested, and performance will be evaluated on ex vivo phantoms and healthy volunteers. In Aim 2,
a noninvasive pilot study will be conducted to compare the new QSMmp-MRI technique with MRE on 48 NASH
patients as a primary validation step. The study will be performed in collaboration with the Waianae Coast
Comprehensive Health Center and Queen’s Medical Center and will engage with the local community through
the Waianae ‘Ohana Produce Prescription (WOPRx) Project (GusNIP, USDA)."

1) Research and Evaluation Core training and education programs are effective in providing education and
building capacity, 2) Outreach Core works with investigators to be inclusive of the communities we serve, and 3)
Capacity Core identifies provides early-stage investigators (ESI) with mentorship in target identification, drug
development, and clinical trials. We anticipate that together our Cores will play a key role in developing future
U54 projects that build UCR’s capacity in drug development and clinical trials."
10933478,"Our U54 Outreach Core will facilitate the successful translation, implementation, and dissemination of research
findings developed by U54 investigators. We build on the community relationships, strategies, and partnership
developed during the P20 Planning period. Success of our P20 planning was due to the leadership of Dr.
Christopher Sistrunk, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoHCCC) and Dr. David Lo leader of the
U54 Center for Disparities at University of California, Riverside (UCR). Together, these investigators used
“reverse translation” to bring community engagement to the bench scientists. Traditionally, shared resource
cores support research activities by providing cutting-edge tools, facilities, and well-skilled faculty to advance
research. Yet there is often a gap in resources and knowledge on how research teams can ensure the translation
of their findings from the basic science level (the “bench”) to the community and, also, from the community to
the bench. Thus, the bidirectional potential of translational research has rarely been fully optimized. Building on
the success of our P20 and U54 UCR Center for Disparities we aim for our UCR-CoHCCC U54 partnership to
optimize the bidirectional potential of true community partnership. Community needs, as articulated by
engagement, is typically not directly obtained by bench scientists, and may explain the limited translation of
research findings to communities that are most adversely affected by cancer.1-2 Subsequently, there is a marked
lack of access and awareness of scientific data by community members and limited knowledge of community
need and context by scientists. This inadequate dissemination, lack of data access, and increasing gap between
scientists and communities, limits the impact of scientific discoveries, particularly in racial/ethnic minority
communities. Our U54 Outreach Core moves beyond traditional community engagement to foster rigorous bi-
directional, evidence-based strategies to narrow the divide. Aim 1 will facilitate the integration of the community
engagement across UCR-CoHCCC U54 research projects/pilots and cores. Aim 2 will provide technical
assistance and training to community stakeholders so they can engage UCR-CoHCCC U54-sponsored research
projects and cores. Aim 3 will facilitate the translation and dissemination of UCR-CoHCCC U54 findings to
address knowledge gaps across the cancer health disparities continuum."

Understanding the genetic basis of gene regulation is key to understanding the evolutionary processes that have shaped
specific traits in humans and non-human apes. In turn, identifying and characterizing the genetic variants that lead to
inter-individual responses to different exposures is critical to gain insight into gene by environment interactions and
associated phenotypic consequences. By elucidating the genetic variation that underlies regulatory differences between
species, and the genetic variation that is associated with individual differences in response to environmental cues, we
can gain a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that led to human-specific traits, as well as the genetic
basis of complex traits and diseases. The challenge is that to carry out this work in humans and other apes, one must
rely on in vitro systems.
During the first term of the MIRA award, my lab focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie
the evolution of gene expression, such as natural selection, the influence of epigenetic marks, and the effects of gene
duplication. We developed and broadly shared a comparative panel of iPSCs from humans and chimpanzees, and we
established a new approach for iPSC differentiation (we call it ‘guided differentiation’), which makes it feasible for us
to study gene regulation across a broad range of cell types and contexts. We used these systems to study the impact of
variation in gene regulatory networks on complex diseases and the role of gene regulation in the generation of
phenotypic diversity. We explored the roles of gene expression in human diseases, such as cancer and neurological
disorders, and developed methods for analyzing comparative single-cell gene expression data.
In the next term of this award, we propose to continue to study similar broad areas. We will sharpen our focus on gene
by environment interactions and develop a better understanding of the genetic variation that leads to regulatory
variation in response to different exposures. We will employ a dynamic eQTL mapping approach to offer additional
insight into the genetic basis for disease. We will also explore the role of epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA
methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, in mediating gene by environment interactions. We will
use the comparative iPSC panel to explore the relative impact and evolutionary consequences of changes in cis and
trans regulatory mechanisms in dozens of different tissues and cell types and continue to share the panel and derivative
cultures with the community. Finally, we will take advantage of improved single-cell technologies to characterize the
dispersion and robustness associated with single-cell gene regulation and identify genetic mechanisms that underlie
the regulation of gene regulatory noise."

Niemann-Pick disease type C is an invariably fatal autosomal recessive neurovisceral lipid storage disease
affecting all ages. Approximately 85% of patients have hepatomegaly which can develop into hepatic steatosis,
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. Liver defects are especially detrimental in patients with
neonatal onset, with 10% dying from liver failure by 6 months of age. Although the liver is a significant contributor
to disease, the cellular drivers and pathophysiology are incompletely understood. Niemann-Pick C is caused by
over 300 loss-of-function point mutations in the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol-exporting protein NPC1.
We have previously shown that the most common of these mutations, I1061T, is primarily degraded by
FAM134B-dependent ER-selective autophagy (ER-phagy), but there is a crucial need to understand how this
pathway works for other disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, preliminary data indicates that the brain and
liver express two different isoforms of FAM134B with potentially divergent functions. Consequently, there is a
need to understand Niemann-Pick C liver proteostasis and pathogenesis. The next step in addressing these
needs is to pursue the overall objectives of this application: (i) determine the effectors mediating tissue-specific
NPC1 proteostasis and (ii) define the contribution of different cell types to Niemann-Pick C liver pathology. Here
we will test our central hypothesis is that cell type-specific pathways regulate NPC1 proteostasis and drive
Niemann-Pick C liver pathology. We will test our hypothesis using induced hepatocytes and neurons from
isogenic human iPSCs containing a panel of Niemann-Pick C disease-causing mutations. We will leverage
biochemical and genetic assays to establish the extent to which NPC1 proteostasis and FAM134B isoform
function are tissue-dependent (Aim 1). Additionally, we will take advantage of Npc1 loxP mice to delete Npc1
globally, in Kupffer cells/macrophages, or hepatocytes to study how these cells contribute to liver pathology,
function, and inflammation (Aim 2). These studies are expected to identify novel pathways that significantly
contribute to manifestations of Niemann-Pick C-related liver disease across many disease-causing mutations.
This will set the stage for the future discovery efforts to identify and test new therapeutic strategies which correct
both liver and brain. Our rationale for this project is that defining influence of Kupffer cells/macrophages on
tissue-specific proteostasis and liver cell types on disease pathology will provide a strong scientific framework to
develop new liver targeted Niemann-Pick C therapeutics. In addition, we outline a career development plan to
increase liver biology knowledge by leveraging mentorship, technical training, seminars, liver conferences, and
R01 grant writing boot camps. The University of Michigan has committed its support and facilities to allow Dr.
Schultz to complete the proposed research and participate in their extensive training seminars. Completion of
the proposed 5-year research and training plans will prepare Dr. Schultz for an independent research career and
assist in securing an R01 from NIDDK."
10761715,"Abstract
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly in
developed countries, and there are limited therapeutic options. The earliest clinical signs are lipid and protein
deposits known as drusen, that form between the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and the adjacent
pentalaminar collagenous extracellular matrix, Bruch’s membrane. The RPE functions to maintain the outer
blood-retinal barrier and to support photoreceptor function, including regeneration of visual pigment and
turnover of outer segments. Dysfunction of the RPE underlies pathology leading to AMD. It is thought that in
AMD this dysregulation in RPE cells is at least in part responsible for the formation of drusen. At present, the
exact mechanisms for drusen formation are unknown. A potential approach to detect early AMD patho-
biological changes is through the isolation of exosomes, which are nanovesicles that can be purified from
biofluids (e.g. plasma and urine). Since RPE-released exosomes and other extracellular vesicles are essential
parts of the endosomal pathway, I hypothesize that exosomes released from stressed RPE cells are
distinct from those released from unstressed RPE cells, and that these exosomes are involved in the
pathognomonic deposit formation and ECM changes that underlie the early and late stages of AMD. By
evaluating two complementary in vitro and in vivo AMD models, our goal for this project is to determine the role
of exosome secretion in sub-RPE deposit formation and in ECM changes under conditions relevant to AMD,
and whether pharmacological or gene therapy/biological therapeutic interventions are possible. In the first
aim, I will characterize and quantify the protein and lipid composition of sub-RPE deposits, ECM and basal-
side exosomes in RPE stressed by pathophysiological conditions implicated in AMD (oxidative stress,
complement dysregulation, and age), while modulating exosome release by both pharmacological and genetic
approaches. In the second aim, I will molecularly tag, isolate and characterize RPE-derived exosomes from
the blood of a well characterized mouse model of early-stage AMD. Detailed profiling of RPE-derived
exosomes in normal and diseased settings represent novel studies that will provide insight into mechanisms
that underlie pathobiological changes in AMD."

The Hyperpolarized MRI Technology Resource Center (HMTRC) is designed to be timely, nimble and highly
productive in the development of new hyperpolarized (HP) MR instrumentation, techniques, acquisition and
analysis software through push-pull interactions with Collaborative Project (CP) investigators. In parallel, another
key goal of the center is to disseminate these newly developed technologies to the Service Project (SP)
Investigators for extramural feedback and to the general scientific community through the new website,
symposia/seminar, monthly newsletter, annual HP MR Technology Workshops, and hands-on training. In order
to accomplish all these goals and functions, a carefully-constructed administrative plan has been developed &
refined over the past 10 years, with a clearly defined, but dynamic structure that can be modified to meet new
challenges and changing collaborative, service, training and dissemination needs. This has required a detailed
organizational structure to enable “team decision-making”, so that each member of the team can provide their
specialized input for optimal technology development and translation to address unmet scientific and/or clinical
needs.
The HMTRC administrative structure and implementation have evolved considerably since the original
submission as the interactions and complexity of the P41 have increased dramatically over the past ten years.
These improvements have also benefited from great institutional support, input from many experienced sources
including the external advisory committee (EAC), leading experts in HP technology, the HP Radiologist
Leadership & Translational Advisory committees, NIBIB Program Staff, and interactions with other P41 centers.
The HMTRC administrative infrastructure now extends nationally to provide information, dissemination of novel
technologies to CPs, SPs, and other investigators conducting HP 13C MRI preclinical and clinical research. As
stated in their attached report: “The EAC … is unanimous in their assessment that the HMTRC is high functioning
as an NCBIB. The HMTRC has led the nation (and the world) in the development and translation of HP MRI
through a unique combination of skills, expertise, instrumentation, environment, clinical engagement, and
industry engagement, which simply does not exist elsewhere. The HMTRC will continue to serve as a critical
national resource through the next funding cycle as the field of HP MRI expands and matures, particularly with
the clinical translation of new HP agents, and more sites engaging in research involving human subjects. The
restructured Center benefits from clear and enhanced synergy between all TR&Ds and Collaborative Projects
that are more broadly geographically distributed”."

and MRI hardware technologies required for all hyperpolarized (HP) 13C MRI studies performed & supported by
this P41 Center’s TRDs, CPs and SPs. Since its inception in 2011, this TRD has been highly successful in
developing and disseminating novel technologies for preclinical HP MRI worldwide, and driving first-ever HP 13C
studies in humans. As stated in the recent External Advisory Committee’s 2021 report: “Since the last competitive
renewal, the number of sites that have begun acquiring data from human subjects has risen from one – UCSF –
to twelve, all of which have been supported by the HMTRC. Of the 36 trials that are registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov, the majority (21) are now being carried out at other institutions that have benefitted from the
outstanding leadership of the HMTRC… The HMTRC has led the nation (and the world) in the development and
translation of HP MRI through a unique combination of skills, expertise, instrumentation, environment, clinical
engagement, and industry engagement, which simply does not exist elsewhere”.
In this renewal project, new dissolution DNP technology will be developed by TRD1 to achieve higher
polarizations for HP probes (TRD2), driven by the needs of all CPs with iterative push-pull optimization &
specialized training. TRD1 technology resources will be disseminated and used by SPs and the international HP
13C scientific community with feedback on performance, quality of training, and ease of dissemination. TRD1 will
develop improved polarization, dissolution and sample delivery technologies required for all CPs, SPs and TRDs.
New DNP and MR hardware for preclinical studies will be driven by the needs of CPs together with TRD2. Clinical
innovation will be driven by CP1,3-6,8-10,13. The HP pharmacy team will create robust, reduced-cost, sterile
HP 13C-probe manufacturing methods that meet FDA guidelines. TRD1 will develop novel 13C RF exciters and
detectors, working closely with TRD3 to create and test new methods for data reconstruction, visualization and
analysis. These methods will be developed in a push-pull fashion, driven by the CPs for metabolic imaging of
liver disease (CP2,6), cardiac disease (CP2), cancer (CP1,3,4,8,9,13), brain disorders (CP5,10) and HP
perfusion imaging (CP7). A major focus of this TRD1 project will also be the specialized training of new intra- &
extramural investigators both through hands-on training at this P41 center and via webconferences, on-line

10784734,"TRD2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Eleven of the 13 Collaborative Projects (CPs 1-10,13) that are the driving force behind this HMTRC renewal and
10 of the 12 Service Projects (SPs 1-4, 6, and 8-11) demonstrate a clear need for improved hyperpolarized (HP)
probes and methods, realistic preclinical models, correlative pathology and molecular methodologies, and other
synergistic imaging studies provided by TRD2. Over the last decade of funding, TRD2 has an outstanding record
of productivity, having supported 117 peer-reviewed publications and 41 NIH grants, and during the prior funding
period, we have leveraged preclinical advances to obtain FDA IND approval for two new HP probes – [2-
13C]pyruvate for improved imaging of the TCA cycle and in 2021 co-polarized [13C,15N2]urea and [1-13C]pyruvate
for simultaneous metabolic and perfusion imaging.
Based on the new needs of the CPs and SPs, the advice of our External Advisory Committee, and clinical
consultants, this TRD2 renewal project will take several exciting innovative directions focused on increasing HP
13C probe sensitivity, in vivo performance, and clinical translatability through the development/optimization of HP
probes, probe formulations and polarization approaches (Aim 1), optimizing more realistic preclinical models
and methods for HP 13C MR studies (Aim 2) and obtaining correlative pathologic, molecular and multimodal
imaging studies (Aim 3) to optimize and validate HP 13C MR biomarkers and methods for clinical translation.
These research goals will be accomplished in synergy with TRD1 through implementing a new preclinical 9.4T
MR scanner with 1H/13C MRI cryoprobe capabilities, a next generation higher field, lower temperature preclinical
DNP polarizer and improved rf coil technologies for significantly improved preclinical HP 13C MR studies. With
TRD3, we will implement more sensitive dynamic HP 13C MR pulse sequences (EPSI, EPI and bSSFP), with a
focus on developing robust, standardized, and quantitative imaging protocols, and new on-line preclinical data
analysis and display tools integrated into the free, open-source platforms.
Although the HP MR probes and techniques will be specifically driven (push-pull) by the CPs, and utilized
(pushed) in the SPs, they will greatly expand the scientific scope and preclinical applicability of HP 13C MR in
general and significantly impact its clinical translation. The main deliverables of this project are the dissemination
of optimized HP probe preparations and methods, new NMR-compatible cell and tissue culture bioreactor
systems and preclinical GEM and PDX models optimized for HP 13C MR studies, correlative pathology, molecular
and synergistic imaging approaches, and the associated dissemination and training for the biomedical
community."
10784736,"TRD3 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Specialized fast acquisitions are a necessity for HP MRI studies by the CPs and SPs, dictating that data
reconstruction and analysis software platforms must be flexible and expansive, covering a variety of coil
geometries, k-space trajectories, vascular delivery and molecular kinetics. The analysis of HP MRI data also
requires specialized methods that account for the bolus kinetics and vascular effects as well as specialized
evaluation approaches since ground truth data is typically not available for comparison. The challenges
remaining for HP acquisition and analysis include quantifying kinetics, heterogeneity of strategies across the
user community, and how to leverage data-driven, machine learning methods for HP MRI. To provide next
generation HP technology as well as to enable multi-site data harmonization and large-scale data analysis, the
Main goals of TRD3: Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Hyperpolarized MR Data are to:
 1) Develop next-generation pulse sequences, reconstruction methods, and analysis methods for HP-13C
 MRI to provide improved spatio-temporal resolution, coverage, and sensitivity to metabolism;
 2) Create standardized methods (phantoms and protocols) to enable multi-site comparison and trials;
 3) Provide advanced HP tools through open-source software that will support next generation acquisition
 and analysis innovations throughout the CPs, SPs and the HP MRI community;
 4) Develop HP MRI analyses that are integrated with other imaging and clinical data.
These will be achieved through the following aims, driven by push-pull collaborations with the CPs:
Aim 1) Development of novel high-resolution and robust acquisitions to improve the utilization of HP signals to
achieve consistent data acquisition, enabling interrogation of metabolic processes
Aim 2) Development of specialized analysis methods to enable robust and reliable interpretation of HP data
Aim 3) Improved management and infrastructure for visualization, integration and sharing of data
The resulting techniques will be disseminated through free, open-source software to service projects and the
general scientific community using our established software frameworks (SIVIC, hyperpolarized-mri-toolbox)
and through the new website, hyperpolarizedmri.ucsf.edu."

10806195,"Project Summary/Abstract
Understanding of genetic interactions can lead to therapeutic design for individual cancer patients by targeting
the specific genetic vulnerability in the cancer genome. For example, by identifying gene pairs that pose severe
fitness defects when knocked out simultaneously (compared to separate knockouts), one can selectively kill
cancer cells that harbor loss-of-function mutation in one protein by inhibiting its synthetic-lethal partner. Despite
generation of large-scale data delineating the tumor transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, imaging, and so on,
little is known regarding how different genes interact with each other and it is unclear how one can design
targeted treatments based on the ‘omics data available. To address these challenges, the proposed research
will develop a “visible” machine learning framework to systematically understand the higher-order genetic
interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer and design targeted treatments.
 The first step for the proposed framework is to gain a holistic view of cancer pathways through combining
the ‘omics data available. Multiple approaches have been applied to integrate data of similar forms, but there yet
lacks an effective solution for integrating data of vastly different qualities and formats. To address this challenge,
Yue Qin has developed a method to infer a hierarchical cancer cell map capturing cancer pathways at multi-
scale resolution by fusing immunofluorescence (IF) imaging data and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-
MS).
 During the F99 phase of the proposed research, by tying the architecture of a deep neural network to the
hierarchical cancer cell map, Yue will develop a “visible” neural network (VNN) that can predict the cancer cell
fitness from genetic perturbation (i.e. knockouts) and genomic backgrounds (i.e. mutations) while providing
mechanistic insights in cancer pathways critical for genotype-phenotype prediction.
 During the K00 phase of the award, Yue will develop genetic engineering approaches to experimentally
map higher-order genetic interactions in cancer cells based on the mechanistic insights obtained from VNN
during genotype-phenotype prediction. The data generated experimentally can directly inspire targeted treatment
designs. In addition, the new data can be integrated into the hierarchical cancer cell map to improve accuracy
and resolution of the inferred pathways, thus further improving the “visibility” of VNN in genotype-phenotype
prediction.
The combination of a computational focused training during F99 phase and experimental focused training
during K00 phase will fully prepare Yue leading her own interdisciplinary research in cancer biology. In addition,
the personalized training plan covering aspects including mentoring and teaching, scientific writing, and oral
presentation will ensure Yue acquiring skills necessary for her future establishment as an independent
investigator."
10784683,"A longstanding promise of biology is that with a deep enough understanding of the molecular rules of life, it should be possible to predict phenotypes from genotype and environment. This would enable rational genome engineering of crops and microbes for desirable traits and facilitate precision medicine through interventions based on an individual’s genetic variation and lifestyle. To make progress towards these goals, technologies are needed to comprehensively identify causal variants, their effects on genes and their interactions, directly in natural populations. Recent advances in high-throughput genome editing make this possible in the model eukaryote S. cerevisiae. This proposal will employ a high-efficiency, multiplexed genome editing system (MAGESTIC) where each cell in a pool receives a distinct edit for a natural variant and a corresponding barcode, which is integrated into the genome after editing. The barcode allows for building arrayed collections of validated strains by recombinase-directed indexing (REDI) and for tracking variant abundance in pooled growth assays by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To identify the basis for trait variation across the S. cerevisiae lineage, five distinct strain backgrounds derived from genetically and ecologically diverse wild isolates will be employed. Libraries will be designed for each strain to introduce >90% of the 85,000 variants observed in the other four strains, enabling studying the impact of the major and minor alleles and the background dependence of their effects. The variant pools will be assayed across a panel of conditions relevant to pathogenic fungi, wild isolates, and human disease, as many variants are expected to exert their effects only in certain environments. To understand how multiple variants modify multigenic traits, a sequential editing and barcoding technology (MARVEL) will be used to generate pairwise and higher-order combinations for up to hundreds of causal variants per trait. This approach will characterize the extent of non-additive effects between variants (i.e. genetic interactions) and genetic background dependencies. This effort will constitute the most comprehensive investigation of genotype-environment-phenotype relationships across a species, and of wild isolates, to date. Ultimately, the data and insights generated by our study will facilitate predictive models linking variants to pathways and phenotypes beyond the S. cerevisiae system, and in particular to other organisms where precision CRISPR editing at this scale is not yet feasible."

disparities and move toward health equity in health outcomes in older adults by increasing the diversity in
aging research by focusing on underrepresented undergraduate students. We are requesting funds to support
8 underrepresented undergraduates per year for a total of 32 who attend our partner institutions full time:
Morgan State University, and University of Maryland Baltimore County. There are 31 program faculty, drawn
from the Departments of Health, Behavior, and Society, Mental Health, Health Policy and Management,
Epidemiology, Biostatistics, School of Medicine, and the School of Nursing at Johns Hopkins University. The
scientific leadership, infrastructure, collaborative nature, and collegial environment provided by these research
programs and program faculty will enable the provision of broad exposure to all undergraduate trainees to the
tenets of health disparities across the life course and minority aging to several age-related diseases such as
cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s Disease, physical disability, and frailty. Specific aims include: (1) Train the
next cadre of health disparities and minority aging researchers by ensuring hands-on participation in
interdisciplinary, age-related research by providing trainees with a research project focusing on health
disparities and/or minority aging across the life course as it relates to cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s
Disease and related dementias, physical functioning, and frailty; (2) Provide research education in health
disparities and minority aging across the life course as it relates to physical and mental health outcomes; (3)
Implement career development opportunities, through individualized mentorship and by leveraging the
leadership and career development resources across the Institution, to prepare trainees to begin their next
career transition; and (4) provide an external evaluation of the outcomes and process of the Hopkins USTAR
program."
10784674,"Summary
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US. There are no therapeutic options beyond physical therapy
to reduce disability burden; thus, new therapeutic options are highly needed. The stroke cavity is the region of
the brain that dies after stroke and does not spontaneously regenerate. We are interested in designing injectable
hydrogel formulations that can promote brain tissue repair after stroke and propose that intra core injection can
be an ideal delivery location. We engineered an angiogenic hydrogel that re-vascularizes the necrotic stroke
cavity, promotes vascular and neurological tissue formation within the stroke core, and promotes behavioral
improvement. Achieving any type of brain repair in the stroke cavity is remarkable. We cannot be sure if
behavioral improvement occurred because of this new tissue formation or due to improved peri-infarct plasticity.
Nevertheless, behavioral improvement was observed between 12 and 16-weeks. We believe that to bring this
technology closer to clinical utility, we must be able to improve the recovery timeline to closer to 4 weeks post
stroke. In this proposal, we will investigate synapse formation and improved mechanical support as a way to
improve recovery timeline after cortical ischemic stroke. Astrocytes play a critical role in synapse formation and
pruning; thus, we will investigate several approaches to modulate this cell population in the brain post stroke and
also the delivery of secreted astrocyte proteins that are known to play a role in synapse formation. This proposal
builds upon our preliminary data that porous scaffolds promote astrocyte infiltration into the material post stroke,
that integrin binding can dictate differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells into astrocytes, and that TSP-1 can
promote similar levels of synapse formation as astrocytes. In particular, we will study how scaffold microstructure
and incorporation of bioactive signaling molecules can promote astrocytic infiltration or differentiation of
progenitor cells towards an astrocytic lineage (Aim 1), how the incorporation of our current angiogenic strategy
into a porous scaffold impacts behavioral improvement (Aim 2), how the delivery of TSP-1 from our porous
scaffolds influences brain repair and behavioral improvement post stroke. Overall, we aim to engineer a pro-
synaptic material that could improve on the timeline and degree of behavioral improvement after stroke."

Recent publications demonstrate that a bone marrow secreted protein, erythroferrone (ERFE), is a negative regulator of hepcidin, which in turn is the main negative regulator of iron absorption and recycling. Hepcidin suppression enables an increase in iron availability during stress erythropoiesis. Thus, diseases of ineffective erythropoiesis, such as β-thalassemia, with chronic erythroid expansion, are associated with increased ERFE expression ultimately causing systemic iron overload. In addition, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and generalized cortical bone thinning have been attributed to ineffective erythropoiesis, erythroid expansion, and the metabolic and endocrine dysfunction caused by secondary iron overload in this disease. Very recent evidence reveals that ERFE suppresses hepcidin by sequestering BMPs, and because BMPs are crucially important for bone metabolism, we hypothesize that ERFE may be involved in coordinating iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, and bone homeostasis. Our preliminary data demonstrates that ERFE is expressed at many fold higher levels in osteoblasts and osteoclasts relative to erythroblasts, ERFE knockout osteoblasts exhibit enhanced mineralization, and ERFE loss in th3/+ mice leads to further decreased bone mineral density by enhancing osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, recent data provides evidence that iron overload is not a primary driver of bone loss in β-thalassemia. We thus propose to explore in detail the cell specific mechanism of action of ERFE and its role in disordered bone metabolism in mouse models of non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia intermedia (Hbbth3/+ (th3/+)) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major (Hbbth3/th3 (th3/th3)) and evaluate the function of ERFE in coordinating iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, and bone homeostasis. Our ultimate goal is to provide novel insights into the complex interplay between regulation of iron metabolism and bone homeostasis in disease of dysregulated erythropoiesis and support the rationale to further explore the therapeutic potential of ERFE for β-thalassemia."

The genome within cells of a multicellular organism is identical, yet distinct cell types display varied functions
due to differences in their epigenome. Therefore, mapping the genome-wide epigenetic landscape of different
cell types within a tissue is critical for understanding cell type-specific gene expression regulation. Techniques
to map epigenetic factors currently rely on our ability to isolate the desired cell types at high purity with certain
biochemical assays, such as quantifying protein-DNA contacts, also requiring a large number of starting cells.
However, cell type-specific markers and antibodies are frequently unknown or unavailable, presenting a major
challenge in isolating cell types at high purity. While transgenic animal models that express cell type-specific
fluorescent reporters can overcome this limitation in some cases, generation of these animal models is time
consuming. Further, tissues frequently contain rare cell types, making it challenging to isolate large numbers of
such cells that are required for assays mapping the binding landscape of transcription factors or chromatin
modifying proteins. To overcome limitations of these current approaches, the overall goal of this proposal is to
establish a marker-free high-throughput technology to map the epigenome of different cell types within a tissue
by developing single-cell sequencing methods to simultaneously quantify the transcriptome and epigenome from
the same cell. The single-cell transcriptomes will be used for the unbiased identification of cell types in silico,
and the corresponding epigenomes of cells belonging to the same cell type will be pooled to generate high-
quality cell type-specific epigenetic landscapes. More specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to develop a single-cell
multiomics technology to simultaneously quantify mRNA, 5mC and DNA accessibility from the same cell. Unlike
a recently developed method that makes these measurements by physically separating mRNA from genomic
DNA, our technology does not involve the physical separation of nucleic acids, thereby enabling high-throughput
processing of thousands of single cells per day. Preliminary experiments suggest that we can efficiently make
these combined measurements from the same cell. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a new single-cell method
to simultaneously quantify mRNA and protein-DNA contacts from the same cell. In preliminary experiments, we
mapped genome-nuclear lamina interactions or the binding pattern of a chromatin modifying protein together
with mRNA from the same cell. Finally, as proof-of-concept that the methods developed in this proposal can be
used to map cell type-specific epigenetic profiles from in vivo tissue samples, we will quantify methylome and
DNA accessibility patterns for cell types in the rat retina. The retina is well-studied neural tissue with over 50 cell
types, including rare ones, and therefore serves as an excellent testbed to validate our technologies. Thus,
through the development of these multiomics single-cell methods, we expect to develop a technology that can
be applied to map the epigenome of different cell types in a tissue without a priori knowledge of cell type-specific
markers, enabling deeper understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation in heterogeneous tissues."
10771934,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is an infectious subviral agent that can propagate in individuals
infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis in humans
and ~20 million people worldwide are estimated to be chronically infected. In the U.S., the
prevalence of chronic HDV infection is rising with recent data suggesting an urgent need for
screening and treatment. There is no FDA approved treatment for HDV with current therapy
consisting of pegylated interferon-alpha which only achieves cure in ~25% of patients. With limited
treatment data available, understanding the dynamics of HDV infection and treatment response
is in its infancy. The new prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib is the first direct acting anti-HDV agent
being tested clinically, but pegylated interferon-lambda, Nucleic acid polymers and HDV/HBV
entry inhibitor myrcludex B are also being investigated as anti-HDV therapies providing ongoing
opportunities characterize HDV treatment dynamics and the mechanism of action of HDV
antivirals and provide a window into the dynamics among HDV, HBV and host during co-infection.
To gain insights into HDV-HBV-host-drug dynamics we have established an interdisciplinary team
that includes clinicians who perform HDV treatment clinical trials, experimentalists to perform
treatment and HDV/HBV coinfection studies in humanized mouse models and mathematical
modelers to create mathematical/computational models to explain the patient and mouse data.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine the MOA of anti-HDV drugs and optimal use
of antiviral agents for the treatment of HDV."

While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has emerged as a validated therapeutic axis in a variety of cancers,
initial monotherapy strategies have proven beneficial only to a subset of patients. These studies have
suggested the importance of T-cells in responsive cancers, thus strategies to improve T-cell stimulation and
infiltration have been prioritized. However, our recent studies (Shuptrine et al., 2017) have identified the
CD47/SIRPα innate pathway, which governs antibody dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP), as one of the
most critical potential mediators of anti-tumor immunity. This suggests that complementary innate anti-tumor
effector pathways involving antibodies, particularly relating to ADCP, may represent critical pathways to
establish effective anti-tumor responses. Recent positive results from the first clinical study using CD47 innate
ICB (with CD20 mAb in resistant lymphoma) strongly suggest that this may be a clinically effective means to
stimulate immunity in cancers (Advani, NEJM, 2018). This may be best explored in solid cancers in HER2+
Breast Cancer (BC), which are currently treated using HER2 mAbs that we recently determined function
through ADCP (Tsao et al., JCI-Insight, in review). Additionally, we have also recently published positive
responses from a vaccine strategy targeting HER2, documenting the induction of polyclonal antibodies (pAbs)
in HER2+ BC patients (Crosby et al., CCR 2019). We have now identified these HER2 pAbs to elicit anti-
tumor effects through the activation of complement, allowing our study of how pAbs (in contrast to monoclonal
HER2-Abs) may differentially impact tumor immunity. Based on our recent adaptive ICB mechanistic studies,
(Crosby et al., 2018), our central hypothesis is that HER2-targeted mAbs or pAbs elicit antibody dependent
phagocytosis (ADCP) that is enhanced by CD47 blockade to immunologically to recruit and prime effector T-
cells that can be expanded through the use of CTLA4 adaptive ICB mAbs and functionally enhanced by the
use of PD1 ICB mAbs. Guided by our preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by utilizing our unique
HER2+ BC models that can be interrogated with the following combinations that comprise our specific aims: 1)
HER2+CD47 mAbs 2) HER2/CD47 mAbs + CTLA4/PD1 ICB combinations and 3) HER2 vaccination + innate
CD47 ICB and CTLA4/PD1 adaptive ICB combinations. These studies will be the first to determine how these
innate and adaptive ICB combinations impact Ab-mediated anti-tumor immunity and mechanistically alter
tumor-specific and non-specific adaptive responses, as well as determine how the HER2 pAb activation of
complement and direct T-cell stimulation can alter anti-tumor immunity in an endogenous HER2 immune-
competent model that possesses few neoepitopes and is αPD1 resistant. The proposed research is significant,
because if fundamental mechanisms and synergies are identified with minimal toxicities, these approaches
could be utilized with targeted mAbs and vaccines in other solid cancers to expand and enhance the potential
utility of immunotherapy as a therapeutic option for the majority of cancers."
10786143,"ABSTRACT: The early phase of the HIV lifecycle encompasses the steps from virus fusion to provirus integration
and represents a critical therapeutic target. Small molecule inhibitors of HIV encoded reverse transcriptase and
integrase are central components of many therapeutic treatment regimens and pre-exposure prophylaxis.
Despite the therapeutic importance of these steps, the field still lacks consensus on several outstanding
questions including how trafficking and uncoating are linked to reverse transcription, how and in what state the
provirus transits through the nuclear pore, what host factors are involved in these processes, and what
distinguishes between a virus that will establish successful infection and one that will fail. Due to the inefficient
and relatively stochastic nature of early phase replication, only a small percentage (~15%) of particles that enter
the cytoplasm after fusion will result in successful provirus integration. As a result, population-based assays that
measure what most viruses do may or may not actually capture what successful viruses do. Nevertheless,
technical limitations have historically mandated a reliance on population-based assays, immortalized cell line
models, and indirect measurements of biological processes whose underlying assumptions don’t necessarily
reflect the biological priors. Only recently have innovations in single-particle tracking, molecular imaging, gene
editing, and structural determination allowed for researchers to overcome these limitations, but these specialized
technologies have not yet been brought together to answer these critical questions in HIV biology. Here, we
assemble a team of HIV researchers with complementary expertise in these powerful approaches to dissect and
define the interactions, kinetics, and dynamics between fusion and integration that result in productive infection.
We propose to leverage a newly optimized toolbox of molecular labeling methods, a technique collectively
termed Infectious Virion Tracking (IVT), to image and track the behavior of individual viral components, ultimately
separating individual virions that result in successful infection from those that enter the cell non-productively.
Additional specialized technologies including primary cell CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and cryogenic electron
microscopy will be leveraged to interrogate the structure and function of individual components along the route
to productive infection. Wielding this novel and innovative series of tools, approaches, and equipment, we aim
to: 1) Define the infectious pathway of HIV from fusion to integration in optimized cell culture models and primary
human target cells; 2) Determine the role of host permissivity factors and viral components in the processes of
the early phase of the HIV life-cycle; and 3) Visualize and define the structure of the viral based machines
associated with the HIV genome as it progresses through reverse transcription, traffics through the cytoplasm,
enters the nucleus, and ultimately integrates in the host chromosomal DNA. As a collaborative team with
complementary specialties that address critical limitations in the field, we are in a unique position to make
significant contributions to our current understanding of the early phases of HIV replication."

Infective endocarditis (IE) has high morbidity and mortality. Upwards of 30% of cases of IE are
caused by oral bacterial species that enter the bloodstream and colonize heart valves. Frequent
episodes of bacteremia from dental biofilm (plaque) are likely to be significant risk factors for
development of IE. Our prior work demonstrates that: 1) there are only informal guidelines for
prevention in 90% of people at risk for IE; 2) tooth brushing results in a high incidence of
bacteremia of IE-causing species; 3) the risk of such bacteremia increases with the level of dental
plaque and calculus present; and 4) patients with IE have a higher burden of dental plaque and
calculus than matched non-IE controls. Although millions of people in the U.S. are at risk for IE
because of pre-existing cardiac conditions, there are no prospective studies or solid evidence to
show that improving oral hygiene reduces bacteremia from routine daily activities (e.g.,
toothbrushing). Evidence does show, however, that bacteremia is a strong surrogate marker for
risk of IE. The lack of supporting data means that longstanding speculation about the importance
of oral hygiene and gingival inflammation as risk factors for IE have had too little impact on
practice guidelines on prevention, clinical practice, or funding for preventive care. The next step
is to determine if professional scaling and oral hygiene instruction significantly reduce the
incidence and duration of IE-causing bacteremia from toothbrushing. We plan to enroll 320 people
at risk for IE into a clinical trial. Enrollees will be randomized to professional scaling and oral
hygiene instruction versus routine oral care. We will test the steps in the hypothesized causal
pathway from improved oral hygiene to decreased bacteremia from IE-causing species by: 1)
determining the impact of professional scaling and oral hygiene instruction on the incidence and
duration of bacteremia with IE-causing species during and following toothbrushing; 2) comparing
oral hygiene and gingival health measures between randomized treatment groups and testing
whether improvement in these measures is associated with reduced incidence and duration of
bacteremia from toothbrushing; and 3) determining the degree to which reduction in bacteremia
incidence and duration, and improvement in oral hygiene and gingival inflammation scores, are
maintained following the intervention. This study will provide novel, important data to inform the
healthcare community, guideline committees, and health funding agencies of the importance of
improving oral hygiene and reducing gingival inflammation as primary preventive measures for all
people at risk of IE."

The overarching goal of the Enriching ECHO with High-risk Pregnancies and Children with Disabilities (Enriching
ECHO) cohort is to advance disabilities inclusivity in ECHO research by studying children with a spectrum of
disability and by leveraging existing data from ECHO participants with disabilities. Our scientific premise is that
psychosocial environmental exposures (e.g., SDH, stress, social environment, discrimination) and modifiable
personal factors (e.g., parenting style, social supports, mental health) impact the physical and emotional health
of children with disabilities resulting in definable outcomes of function, well-being, and participation in community
and family life. Our hypothesis is that we can identify specific environmental factors associated with better -than-
expected positive health outcomes along the continuumof disability to typical development. The EnrichingECHO
cohort will address this hypothesis via the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Leveraging ECHO core data elements, we will (a) compare trajectories of children with and without
disabilities over time, from birth to school age (5-6 years), with positive health (child well-being) as the primary
outcome. We will evaluate the effect of (b) pre-natal environmental and psychosocial exposures and (c) post-
natal nutrition, sleep health, and physical activity on positive health trajectories in these child cohorts over time..
Aim 2: In the entire cohort (a) we will identify maternal pre- and peri-natal psychosocial exposures associated
with post-natal outcomes (e.g., birth defects, birthweight, prematurity, early life disabilities) in high -risk and
uncomplicated pregnancies. (b) We will test which pre-, peri-, and post-natal factors best predict the primary
outcome of child well-being (positive health) at school-age, adjusting for co-linearity effects. (c) Comparing the
cohorts of children with and without disability, we will examine whether parenting style and caregiver social
support are modifiable exposures associated with better-than-expected positive health.
Aim 3: To ensure significance and impact on ECHO science, the Enhancing ECHO cohort emphasizes diversity
and inclusion of underrepresented groups by engaging mothers and offspring with a range of disabilities. Our
approach will (a) recruit participants with high-risk pregnancies who are most likely to deliver children with
disabilities and include individuals with disabilities who are often excluded from research studies. We will ( b)
collaborate with community stakeholders with disabilities to design engagement, retention, and dissemination
strategies, and (c) standardize early ECHO surveillance for disabilities across cohorts.
Aim 4: In a cohort of ECHO participants with second pregnancies, we will explore whether the peri-natal
environmental exposures associated with positive child health in the older ECHO sibling (identified in Aim 2b)
are predictive of post-natal birth outcomes in the second ECHO pregnancy.

10764294,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, as well as neuronal death, are the pathologic hallmarks
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therapeutic efforts focused on Aβ have thus far failed, underscoring the urgent
need for alternate approaches, particularly those that can target early AD. Aberrant tau in the locus coeruleus
(LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain that regulates attention, arousal, stress responses, and
cognition, is the earliest detectable AD-like neuropathology in the human brain, and LC degeneration is
ubiquitious in later AD. Recent research indicates that early LC dysfunction may contribute to prodromal AD
symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, while later LC degeneration exacerbates cognitive
impairment. Although these data suggest that the LC is a promising therapeutic target in AD, almost nothing
known about how pathogenic tau impacts LC function and survival. We have developed a viral vector that
drives the expression of wild-type human tau exclusively in LC neurons, which over time becomes
hyperphosphorylated and misfolded, thus recapitulating the earliest forms of human AD. We will use this novel
tool to study the consequences tau pathology in the LC. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of different
forms of aberrant tau on LC neuron morphology, survival, and local inflammation, and assess the potential of
LC-derived tau pathology to spread to interconnected forebrain regions. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo
electrophysiology and behavioral paradigms to evaluate how tau pathology affects LC activity and performance
in neuropsychiatric and cognitive domains. In Aim 3, we will combine optogenetics and fMRI to determine how
aberrant tau influences LC-forebrain functional connectivity. Completion of these aims will lay the groundwork
for LC/tau-based therapies for early AD."

Cerebral Autosomal Dominate Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a
common small vessel disease (SVD) that is characterized by microvascular dysfunction leading to ischemic
stroke and vascular dementia. CADASIL is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene expressed by smooth
muscle cells (SMCs), that are associated with larger vasculature such as arteries/arterioles, and pericytes that
wrap around capillaries. These mutations induce extracellular receptor aggregation and complex formation with
other proteins including matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, TIMP3. TIMP3 therefore accumulates around the
microcirculation causing impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation. Downstream of TIMP3 accumulation,
the pathomechanism includes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition, resulting in decreased
neurovascular coupling (NVC) and ATP production. While this pathomechanism has been investigated in other
vascular cell types (endothelial cells and SMCs), pericytes remain understudied.
Pericytes are an abundant, highly heterogenous population, that includes mesh pericytes which display fast
on/off contractile responses and typically reside on 1-4th order capillaries. Recent studies have revealed a KATP
channel, Kir6.1, is uniquely highly expressed in pericytes compared to other cells in the microvascular domain.
This channel has proven to be highly relevant in CBF regulation where activation of the channel from low ATP,
results in pericyte hyperpolarization, ensuing vasodilation to enhance regional cerebral perfusion to meet energy
demands. Due to the CADASIL’s early presentation of neurovascular dysfunction, this proposal focuses on mesh
pericytes and their impairment.
My preliminary data show that, in CADASIL, mesh pericyte Kir6.1 channels are hyperactive in basal conditions,
indicating dysregulation of channel activity. However further characterization of the channel is needed to
elucidate potential treatment targets. Specifically, how TIMP3 and EGFR signaling influence Kir6.1 channel
activity. This proposal’s first Aim is to characterize Kir6.1 channel properties using a bimodal approach looking
at both function and expression in cerebral mesh pericytes. The goal of the second Aim is to expose the
mechanism underlying Kir6.1 channel dysfunction including TIMP3 exogenous application and genetic
knockdown. This Aim will also employ rescue techniques via EGFR ligand, HB-EGF, to restore Kir6.1 channel
function, which due to its prominent expression in cerebral pericytes may be key to restoring CBF dysregulation
in CADASIL. Completion of this proposal will fill a significant gap in the literature involving cerebral mesh
pericytes and the devastating cerebrovascular disease, CADASIL which currently has no cure and limited
treatment options."

The long-term goal of this research is to determine how bacteria maintain cell envelope integrity in the
face of harsh and fluctuating environmental conditions. The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria
is composed of the cytoplasmic membrane, peptidoglycan cell wall, and the lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-containing outer membrane. In the intracellular pathogens, Brucella spp., the composition of
the LPS is critical for virulence and persistence in the host. Our group recently identified a periplasmic
protein of unknown function, named EipA, that is conserved across the class Alphaproteobacteria,
including Brucella. Deletion of eipA in Brucella abortus results in a sensitivity to envelope stressors
and an attenuation of virulence in a mouse model of infection. In Brucella ovis, a species that lacks
smooth LPS, eipA is essential. Conditional depletion of eipA expression in B. ovis causes cells to
form chains; this provides evidence for a role for EipA in cell division. Preliminary cryo-electron
microscopy results indicate that these chained cells fail to control the distance between the
cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane, resulting in an extended periplasm in eipA-depleted
cells. In aim 1, I will investigate the effect of eipA depletion on the cell envelope architecture.
Specifically, I will test the role of eipA in a) peptidoglycan synthesis and remodeling at the septum and
b) the binding of EipA to phospholipids. In aim 2, I will characterize suppressor mutations that restore
growth to the eipA depletion strain and perform an unbiased pull-down assay with the goal of
identifying the molecular interaction partners of EipA. The experiments described in this proposal will
clarify the role of the essential gene eipA in B. ovis and will add to our understanding of the
alphaproteobacterial cell envelope."

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common respiratory sequelae of prematurity and is often fatal.
Montelukast is FDA-approved and already shows promise in small neonatal trials. Because of limited
pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) research, the optimal montelukast dose for premature infants
to avoid BPD is unknown. We propose the Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of montelukast in
infants with developing BPD (PRISM) trial, a dose-escalating open-label pharmacokinetic, safety and
preliminary efficacy trial in premature infants (born < 29 weeks’ gestation) at high risk for BPD (requiring
positive pressure ventilation between 29-33 weeks). Our central premise is that re-purposing a non-steroid
anti-inflammatory agent will be safe and show preliminary efficacy in preventing BPD. Our objective is to
perform population-specific PK/PD analyses under FDA regulatory guidance to identify the optimal montelukast
dose to use in a definitive phase III trial. The trial will begin with a low-dose (0.75 mg/kg/day) cohort, and will
proceed sequentially to the medium- (1.5 mg/kg/day) and high-dose (2.25 mg/kg/day) cohorts after safety
reviews. Dosing will last 4 weeks involving 90 infants (30/cohort) at up to 8 experienced neonatal sites. A
comparator cohort of placebo-treated NICHD-trial infants with similar age and disease severity will serve as
historical controls. The primary outcome will be the drug clearance (CL/F), which is the key determinant of
maintenance dosing. Secondary outcomes will include safety (determined by total adverse events) and
exposure-response relationships between montelukast and change in BPD risk over the treatment period.
Our first aim will be to characterize the PK of montelukast in premature infants. We hypothesize that the
clearance in the infants ≤ 28 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) (i.e. PMA = gestational age + postnatal age) will
be at least 30% reduced compared to infants > 28 weeks. Our second aim is to characterize the safety profile
of montelukast in premature infants; we hypothesize that the montelukast adverse event rate will not increase
with montelukast exposure. Lastly, we aim to determine preliminary efficacy of montelukast in premature
infants; we hypothesize that the change in moderate-severe BPD risk calculated from a population PK/PD
linear regression model will decrease by 30% with increasing montelukast AUC0-24.The PRISM PK/PD results
will be submitted to the FDA, and will help determine the optimal dose of montelukast to reduce BPD. The
impact of the PRISM trial could be monumental in the field of neonatology."

The broad goal of this application is to advance PTSD genetic discovery and address inequity in PTSD genetics
research by leveraging a partnership between the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium – Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder Working Group (PGC-PTSD) and a network of African investigators, including the Neuropsychiatric
Genetics in African Populations (NeuroGAP) program and the Ugandan Genome Resource (UGR). By the end
of 2022, the PGC-PTSD will achieve the largest genetic mapping of PTSD to date based on multiethnic meta-
analysis of > 1,280,000 samples, leading to 95 risk loci meeting genome-wide significance for PTSD. Beyond
discovery, recent work on polygenic risk scores in PTSD shows the potential for the utility of these measures in
research. This success is overshadowed, however, by the persistent underrepresentation of African populations
in PTSD genetic research, which poses a challenge for both scientific advances in PTSD and global equity.
African genomes are characterized by shorter haplotype blocks and contain almost a million more variants per
individual than populations outside Africa. The lower correlation between genetic markers in African populations
is also useful for fine- mapping disease-causing alleles. However, differences in the African genome also result
in limited cross-population transferability of polygenic risk scores, and, by extension, poorer performance in
uncharacterized populations such as those from Africa. There is significant risk that the recent advances in PTSD
genetics will result in a widening of the massive research and treatment disparities for African populations. This
inequity is particularly troubling given the disproportionately high burden of trauma and PTSD faced by African
populations both in the US and on the African continent. Thus, data from African populations in genetic studies
of PTSD are critical to generate a complete picture of genetic risk factors, identify potentially missing novel
therapeutic signals garnered by studying all populations, and address growing health inequity. We propose
addressing this inequity by accomplishing the following Specific Aims: (1) Expand the PGC–PTSD sample bank
with over 27,000 cases and 112,000 controls from the African continent and diaspora to achieve a robust, well-
powered sample size of over 190,000 participants (~39,000 cases, 151,000 controls) with African ancestry; (2)
Integrate data across Africa and African diaspora and perform analyses to expand PTSD risk loci discovery; and
(3) Leverage African ancestry populations to improve fine-mapping and gene prioritization and to reduce health
inequality by improving PRS accuracy for PTSD in these populations. These aims are highly consistent with
NIMH Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2, Strategy 1.2.A “Discovering gene variances and other genomics
elements that contribute to mental illnesses in diverse populations.”"

The Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill requests a competing renewal for
our pre- and postdoctoral interdisciplinary training program in health services research for the years 2023-28.
Predoctoral trainees will be supported by the program for two years, and will have already completed their
coursework. They will be drawn from multiple disciplines including, but not limited to: health policy,
epidemiology, health behavior, economics, pharmacy, allied health, nursing, and sociology. Postdoctoral
trainees will work with a mentor to develop and complete research related to the delivery of health services in
the currently changing health care system. While some postdoctoral trainees may have had PhD level training,

10752706,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With technological breakthroughs in high-throughput single-cell imaging and screening, we can precisely monitor
native cell behavior in response to diverse stimuli. Improvements in resolution and new detection capacity further
enrich the recording from each cell. Many image-processing steps that help to extract the full breadth of the
recording can be automated to a throughput comparable to the imaging itself. However, because biological
samples can be complex and nonhomogeneous, it is valuable to specify subsets of cells when addressing
downstream biological questions. With the amount of data that can now be generated from high-throughput
measurements, this subset-selection step is a significant bottleneck to obtaining a quantitative result about the
biological sample. Currently, the gold standard to reliably filter through cell data is manual annotation by a
technician. This approach is costly and time-consuming, creating a significant bottleneck to answering important
biological questions. To overcome this bottleneck, we will develop tools to automate annotation with three unique
approaches: chemical annotation, annotation amplification, and cellular barcoding. Chemical annotation will
deliver a computer-readable cell label via an additional biomarker. Annotation amplification will use small,
curated datasets to generate large ones. Cellular barcoding will identify pixel-based signatures to uniquely
identify individual cells. Once annotation is addressed computationally, relevant cells can be classified in-line
with the acquisition. We can then produce a large annotated dataset. Both the computational tools and data
repository will be shared with the scientific community as a validation set for new models and as a foundation for
algorithms that could be developed across research groups studying cells with fluorescence imaging. The goal
of this work is to generate the technology and define the experimental-computational methods that automate the
highly manual steps of cell curation through a strong interplay between wet-lab and machine-learning techniques.
The technology we propose is relevant to a broad scope of high-throughput measurement applications, because
it enables curating samples computationally rather than experimentally."
10930901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Early attention and behavior dysregulation are developmental precursors to later disruptive behavior disorders,
one of the major categories of childhood psychopathology. Recent conceptualizations of child behavior disorders
classify these diagnoses as neurodevelopmental conditions, which suggests unexplored prenatal and early life
origins. The proposed study will test the premise that child behavior dysregulation emerges, in part, from prenatal
exposures to disrupted maternal sleep and emotion dysregulation—a transdiagnostic indicator of
psychopathology. Data from our laboratories provide evidence that exposure to maternal emotion dysregulation
associates with neurodevelopmental differences in newborn arousal and attention, as measured within hours
after birth. Additional pilot analyses reveal that this blunted neurodevelopmental profile associates with behavior
problems at 18 months. A goal of this study is to explore whether early sleep difficulties function as a behavioral
mechanism connecting infant neurodevelopmental profiles to toddler attention and behavior dysregulation at 12
months. Sleep is a foundational health behavior and one of the earliest dyadic/family-based regulatory
processes. We propose an innovative design for measuring maternal, paternal, and infant sleep variability,
defined as inconsistency in hours slept per night, using a longitudinal burst design. Sleep will be assessed via
actigraphy and research-validated consumer devices during the 2nd and 3rd trimester, week 1 after birth, then
months 4, 6, 9, and 12. We aim to test whether (1) prenatal exposure to maternal emotion dysregulation,
chronotype, and sleep variability predicts infant neurodevelopment and maternal-infant sleep variability; (2) infant
neurodevelopment interacts with environmental sleep structure (e.g., bedtime routines) to affect infant sleep
variability over time; and (3) infant sleep trajectories characterized by high variability (i.e., failure to attain
normative stability) will mediate associations between neurodevelopmental profiles and toddler attention and
behavior dysregulation. An exploratory aim will incorporate direct and indirect influences of partners on maternal
and infant sleep. To accomplish these innovative aims, we will use established protocols to enroll women in the
2nd trimester of pregnancy (N=200 women) along a uniform distribution of emotion dysregulation, and their
partners. This technique overrepresents women with high dysregulation and increases statistical power. Women,
partners, and infants will then be followed for the first 12 months after birth using techniques that minimize
burden, due to passive monitoring and brief surveys. This study builds upon rigorous prior research, including
work from our own NIH-funded projects, to delve into the crucial challenge of infant sleep. The study unites a
stellar team, with expertise in maternal emotion dysregulation, infant neurodevelopment, adult and infant sleep,
longitudinal designs, and toddler attention and behavior dysregulation. Our study is significant because we may
identify modifiable processes—infant and family sleep—that could contribute to early psychopathology risk,
thereby reducing risk for one of the earliest-emerging and most costly classes of pediatric psychiatric distress."
10755728,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to determine whether TBI-induced inflammatory changes result in peripheral
organ damage that is dependent on activation of the inflammasome by extracellular vesicles (EV) and ASC
specks. Our recent work has shown that a crucial part of the TBI-induced systemic inflammatory response
involves release of extracellular vesicles containing a cargo of innate immune proteins that are secreted from
damaged central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Importantly, EV and ASC specks from TBI animals induce
inflammasome activation in peripheral organs. The specific aims of this proposal will determine the cellular and
molecular mechanisms regulating EV- and ASC speck-mediated innate immune inflammatory reactions in
peripheral organs after TBI. The hypothesis of this study is that EV and ASC specks play a central role in
innate immune signaling by carrying inflammasome proteins to peripheral organs after TBI, thus causing tissue
injury. Moreover, neutralization of secreted ASC with a monoclonal antibody decreases peripheral organ
damage after TBI, resulting in improved histopathological outcomes. Aim 1 will determine if TBI alters the
composition of EV proteins in brain, peripheral organs and bodily fluids. These studies will delineate a protein
profile of EV proteins after TBI. Aim 2 will establish if ASC specks accumulate in brain and peripheral organs
after TBI and induce an inflammatory responses leading to pyroptosis. We will investigate whether the
activation of inflammasomes in vivo leads to the appearance of ASC specks and whether the deposition of
ASC specks in tissues induces the recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes, thus contributing to the
inflammatory milieu in peripheral organs. Aim 3 will determine the therapeutic effects of antibody neutralization
of the inflammasome on histopathological outcomes after TBI. These studies will provide critical information
about the activation patterns of innate immunity regulated by EV and ASC specks in the CNS, and identify
relevant therapeutic targets to control inflammation following TBI and other neurodegenerative disorders."
10755651,"Recombination is essential in maintaining genome stability, and even minor deficiency in recombinational
double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways results in cancer or other severe diseases. The initial processing of
DNA DSBs to single strands, a process termed DNA end resection, is the critical first step of homologous
recombination needed for the loading of damage response and repair proteins. Resection is tightly controlled in
the cell cycle and determines the usage of homologous recombination versus nonhomologous end joining for
repair. In yeast and human cells, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1/Xrs2 complex initiates resection, whereas Exo1 or
Sgs1-Dna2 mediates extensive resection. Systematic studies of resection have thus far only been done in
euchromatin, whereas we propose to study it in three different types of silenced heterochromatin. We designed
many new assays to examine resection within transcriptionally silent chromatin in fission yeast (Aim #1). The
fission yeast system provides an excellent model organism for this study as chromatin features are well
conserved with those in human cells. In Aim #2 we focus on control of one of the most mutagenic pathways of
DSB repair called Break Induced Replication (BIR). BIR is normally used for the repair of a single-end DSB. Here
the goal is to understand how this pathway is suppressed during the repair of two-ended DSBs. We focus on the
role of ssDNA annealing by Rad52 and synchronous resection of two ends of a DSB by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2
complex. In Aim #3 we focus on the resection-independent function of Dna2 nuclease/helicase during
homologous recombination."
10764229,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Severe aortic valve stenosis and coronary artery disease afflict a large number of patients worldwide.
Choosing the optimal management strategies among various alternatives requires accounting for the
characteristics and comorbidities of individuals that best determine the potential benefits or harms from
different treatment approaches. However, randomized trials often do not collect the information necessary to
inform individualized treatment decisions – in particular, data on patient frailty is typically not captured. In this
grant, we will take advantage of linkages between two trial programs, the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study
(comparing shorter vs. longer duration of antiplatelet therapy after coronary stenting) and the US CoreValve
Program (comparing surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement), with data from Medicare claims
as part of the NHLBI-sponsored Extending Trial-Based Evaluations of Medical Therapies Using Novel
Sources of Data (EXTEND) Study to answer these additional questions. First, we will identify variables
available in administrative claims that correlate with frailty among individuals undergoing aortic valve
replacement or coronary artery stenting and assess whether they predict long-term adverse cardiovascular
outcomes above traditional risk factors ascertained in trials. Next, we will determine whether claims-based
frailty indices derived from these non-trial data can identify heterogeneous treatment effects – i.e. treatment
effects that differ between individuals based on their personal characteristics – within the trials' randomized
populations. Based on these results, we will then create and pilot the implementation of quantitative decision
tools to support individualized treatment approaches for patients with aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve
replacement and those who require dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent procedures. The results of
this research will greatly enhance our understanding of whether administrative claims data can be used to
augment the evaluation of patient frailty within clinical trials, and determine whether frail patients with
cardiovascular disease require different treatment strategies. The results may also greatly improve the ability to
identify individual patients who have the most or least to gain from different treatment approaches for two
common and highly morbid cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the proposed research will help create evidence-
based decision tools that can be used to support shared decision making between clinicians and patients with
aortic valve stenosis and coronary artery disease."
10764230,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, affect millions of individuals in the United States leading to
significant morbidity and mortality. While intensive lifestyle intervention and bariatric surgery are common
treatment approaches, lifestyle intervention is not typically durable in the long term, and surgical procedures
carry the risk of complications. Hence, there is a critical need to identify novel druggable targets to effectively
treat diabetes and obesity. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate important physiological functions
through a diverse array of ligands and are the most successful class of druggable targets. Therefore, elucidating
the physiological function of GPCRs in key metabolic organs holds promise to the development of novel
therapeutics for metabolic diseases. In recent years, gastrointestinal (GI) tract has become an emerging
therapeutic target for metabolic disease therapy. Incretins, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are gut hormones secreted by the enteroendocrine cells
in the gut to regulate glucose metabolism and energy balance via endocrine and neural mechanisms. The
release of incretin hormones is tightly regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their cognate
ligands. However, pathways regulating endogenous gut hormone secretion are not completely understood. We
recently discovered that GPR17 is expressed in the GLP-1 (but not GIP)-producing cells in human gut. The
overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the metabolic function of Gpr17 in the GI tract. Our preliminary data
showed that loss of Gpr17 in gut epithelium leads to improved glucose tolerance with increased glucose-
stimulated insulin and GLP-1 (but not GIP) secretion. Gpr17 gut knockout mice also exhibit increased satiety
during fasting-refeeding challenge. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that inhibiting Gpr17 function
in the gut improves glucose homeostasis and increases satiety via modulating enteroendocrine cellular function
and gut hormone release. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following studies. In Aim 1, we will determine
the role of intestinal epithelial Gpr17 in glucose homeostasis by measuring nutrient-stimulated GLP-1 and other
gut hormone secretion and systemic insulin sensitivity. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of intestinal Gpr17 in
satiety regulation by examining the effects on gut physiology and vagal sensory system. In Aim 3, we will
functionally characterize Gpr17 signaling and identify molecular mechanisms to potentiate GLP-1 secretion in
enteroendocrine cells. Our preliminary data and the demonstrated availability of in vitro and in vivo models
support the feasibility of our proposed study. Upon successful completion of this proposal, we expect to
determine the metabolic effect of Gpr17 signaling in the gut on systemic glucose metabolism and satiety
regulation. These studies will lay the foundation for identifying novel molecules that target Gpr17 in the brain-gut
axis for the development of potential therapeutic approaches."

This proposal describes a five-year plan for Dr. Alireza Haghighi's career development towards becoming an
independent cardiovascular investigator. Currently an Instructor in Medicine and Clinical Molecular Geneticist in
Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and Harvard Medical School (HMS),
Dr. Haghighi's long-term career goals
are to translate genomic research into clinical advances for cardiovascular patients. His career development and
research plan leverages his training in human genetics and the unique training environment of BWH, HMS, and the
Broad Institute that will provide him with new skills in statistics, computational biology, and induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC) disease modeling, in order to shed novel insight into the mechanisms underlying hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM). His career development goals will be achieved through scientific investigation and
collaborations, and supported by mentorship, didactic coursework and conferences. Dr. Haghighi has assembled a
Mentoring and Scientific Advisory Committee that includes world experts in cardiology, and human genetics: Drs.
Christine Seidman (primary mentor), Jon Seidman (co-mentor), Shamil Sunyaev (advisor) and Mark Daly (advisor),
who have mentored countless young investigators to successful independent investigators.
 HCM is the most common inherited cardiovascular diseases and the leading cause of sudden death in
young people. Dominant mutations in sarcomere proteins cause HCM in 30-60% of patients- data that has
enabled mechanistic studies that propel new therapeutic strategies to treat HCM. These opportunities are
profoundly limited in sarcomere-negative (unexplained) HCM patients in whom there is no understanding of how
or why disease emerges. Dr. Haghighi's whole exome sequencing (WES) analyses in genetically unexplained
HCM patients concluded that non-coding variants may play a role in pathogenesis of this disease. This proposal
seeks to define genetic etiologies (with a focus on non-coding variants) for HCM in patients that remain unsolved
after WES sequencing by whole genome sequencing (WGS). To determine the functional impact of newly
identified non-coding variants, Dr. Haghighi will model and characterize prioritized candidate variants in human
isogenic cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs). Using these approaches he
will explore three specific aims that (1) Identify rare variants in non-coding regions of known HCM genes and
prioritized genes in blood and heart tissue samples of unexplained HCM patients by WGS, (2) Define
dysregulated gene expressions and splicing effects of identified variants by RNAseq, and (3) Assess the effects
of prioritized non-coding variants in human iPSCs. By providing fundamental new insights into the functional role
of non-coding variants that may uncover new causes of HCM (thereby improving patient care), these studies will
support NHLBI goals to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of health and disease. In addition,
successful completion of the proposed studies advance
Dr. Haghighi's transition to an independent clinical-
scientist and provide him with a solid foundation from which he will apply for extramural funding."
10764237,"ABSTRACT
 In high tuberculosis (TB) incidence settings, individuals with TB are often infected with multiple strains
of M. tuberculosis complex (Mtbc). Despite this known fact, current TB transmission studies largely ignore
within-host Mtbc heterogeneity. We believe that accounting for within-host Mtbc heterogeneity will reduce
sampling bias and significantly improve the understanding of TB transmission dynamics in households and in
community gathering places. For example, TB transmission studies in high TB incidence settings have found
that the majority of TB cases occurring concurrently within the same household have non-matching molecular
fingerprints. This finding has led to the conclusion that the majority of household TB cases were acquired
outside of the household. However, none of those studies have appropriately accounted for within-host
heterogeneity, which could have led to missed detection of Mtbc genetic clusters within the household. In
addition, despite numerous TB transmission studies, factors that predict TB transmission remain poorly
understood. Accounting for within-host Mtbc heterogeneity could improve the detection of pathogen and host
related factors that affect transmission. Together, improved understanding of these areas could lead to more
accurate identification of transmission networks and disease hotspots, which can then guide interventions to
interrupt TB transmission. Moreover, the proposed research could instigate significant changes in the practice
of future TB transmission studies by evaluating the impact of accounting for within-host Mtbc heterogeneity on
TB transmission inference.
 The proposed research will address the current gaps in knowledge by incorporating two novel methods
for detecting within-host Mtbc heterogeneity: 1) we will conduct whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on early
primary culture samples to detect heterogeneous Mtbc strains; and 2) we will perform targeted amplicon-based
sequencing of 150 genetic loci important for phylogenetic and resistance prediction. We will use advanced
bioinformatic methods to integrate these sources of data on Mtbc heterogeneity. The proposed research will
also utilize community-based door-to-door active case finding to minimize sampling bias. These methods will
be applied to achieve 2 specific aims: 1) to determine the impact of accounting for within-host heterogeneity of
Mtbc strains on inference in a population-based TB transmission study; and 2) to determine more accurately
the proportion of household TB cases that are attributable to transmission within the household by conducting
a prospective household contact study. We will also determine pathogen and host factors that predict individual
and population-level transmission. This project will generate important scientific knowledge of TB transmission
and factors that affect transmission, and findings will inform and guide targeted interventions to combat TB
epidemics by interrupting the transmission network in local settings."

Aicardi-Goutiéres syndrome (AGS) is a severe, often lethal genetic autoinflammatory
encephalopathy. It typically has an infantile-onset and results in progressive and profound
cognitive and physical disability. There is an urgent need to find an effective therapy for AGS, but
currently, there is no FDA-approved therapeutic approach that effectively alters the pathological
course of this disease. Clinical trials with IFN pathway inhibitors, such as the Janus kinase (JAK)
inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib, have been carried out in AGS; these JAK inhibitors reportedly
resulted in improved systemic manifestations. However, their efficacies in treating brain injury, the
most critical pathological change of AGS, are very limited or ineffective.
There is a gap in AGS therapy development due to the relative rarity of this disease and not
available of an animal model that recapitulates the pathologic features of AGS, especially the
innate immune activation in the brain. We recently created a series of mouse models that
reproduced AGS's genetic, clinical, and pathological features of the brain, including innate
immune activation in the brain. With these AGS mouse models, we have found that the FDA very
recently (2022) approved JAK inhibitor, the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor Deucravacitinib,
and the TANK Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) inhibitors sufficiently block innate immune activation in
the brain cells of AGS mice. Based on our preliminary data and findings from recent publications,
we hypothesize that selective inhibition of the type I IFN signaling pathway and TBK1 will more
effectively diminish the innate immune activation in AGS brains and improve the outcomes of
AGS treatment. In this study, we will address two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to test the
efficacy of deucravacitinib and compare it with baricitinib and ruxolitinib to find which drug is the
best medicine for AGS. Specific Aim two is to determine the significance of the JAK-STAT
pathway in AGS development via analysis of Adar1mut and STAT1/2-/- double mutant mice and
evaluate the effect of TBK1 inhibitor in mitigating neuroinflammatory phenotypes in AGS mouse
models.
In summary, this study will establish a preclinical approach in animal models to assess AGS
therapy. It will provide in vivo evidence to support the repurposed use of JAK inhibitors for AGS
treatment. It will also explore new drug-targeting sites for AGS and other interferonopathies."
10774801,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Biological tissues, consisting of different cells, specialize in a group of processes and functions through
coordinated activities of many cells. Cell-cell communication (CCC) by ligand-receptor interaction provides a
major mechanism for such coordination. Until recently, dissecting CCC required perturbations of selected genes
or proteins regulated within a specific CCC link, presenting major challenges for experimental approaches.
Single-cell genomics that profiles genes and their activities at individual cell level provides an unprecedented
opportunity for systematic screening of all potential CCC links among cells.
 During the past three years, various computational tools, including ours, have enabled CCC inference and
analysis using the nonspatial single-cell (sc) RNA-seq data, leading to many important biological discoveries.
With the rapid growth of spatial transcriptome (ST) techniques that preserve the spatial locations of cells in
addition to profiling gene expression, there is a pressing demand for new mathematical and computational
methods to deal with the unique challenges associated with ST data for CCC inference.
 This application will focus on addressing three major unaddressed challenges for CCC inference using ST
data obtained from a diverse set of current experimental techniques. The first aim is to use scRNA-seq data to
a) improve the coverage of genes that are associated with ligands or receptors not well measured in ST data
through novel Optimal Transport methods, and b) impute spot-resolution data using physical models to estimate
gene expression level for individual cells in the spot – critical information needed for CCC inference. The second
aim is to develop a comprehensive CCC inference method accounting for various CCC regulators, co-factors,
regulated genes, and potential external signals by incorporating prior knowledge and additional data. The third
aim is to create a host of tools by using network analysis methods and neural graph network methods for pattern
recognition, systematic comparisons, and classification of spatial CCC networks inferred from ST data.
 The study premise is based on our novel and extensive preliminary results in CCC inference. The proposed
studies are significant because they will create the first comprehensive integrated tool that can impute ST data,
infer CCC, and classify CCC networks in a systematic way, and success of the studies will establish a new
cornerstone for ST data analysis, leading to novel spatial biological insights for tissues. The proposed studies
are innovative because the proposed tools will have novel functionalities that use the ST data to derive crucial
biological information which is currently impossible to obtain. They will also result in several novel mathematical
and computational methods in the areas of multiscale modeling, optimal transport, and deep learning that will
have broad applications in single-cell and spatial genomics data analysis and beyond."

We propose to establish the Center for Cardiovascular Research in Biomechanics (CRiB), which will provide a
foundation for synergistic translational research activities aimed at developing novel materials and devices to
treat cardiovascular diseases. To maximize impact, the initial set of projects will focus on Peripheral Arterial
Disease (PAD) of the lower extremity arteries because PAD treatments continue to disappoint despite decades
of improvements and refinements in technologies and pharmacological adjuncts. The high rate of treatment
failures makes PAD one of the most expensive vascular diseases to treat on a per-patient basis, increasing the
urgency of developing better biomedical materials and devices. Our team has done extensive research in PAD,
and the strength of our approach is in the use of human tissues, large preclinical animal models, and diverse
multidisciplinary collaborations that enable the direct clinical translation of our discoveries. Support of the
COBRE will help us build a unique research environment with infrastructure to attract and train scientists in
translational cardiovascular biomechanics research. Our CRiB Center will be directed by a senior NIH R01-
funded investigator Dr. Alexey Kamenskiy who has built one of the largest databases of interlinked mechanical,
structural, and demographic characteristics of human arteries and used it to develop novel solutions to improve
clinical outcomes of vascular disease treatments. The CRiB Center will also include a unique Tissue Analysis
Core (TAC) dedicated to performing mechanical, structural, and biological evaluations of human, large animal,
and man-made materials, and directed by an NIH R01-funded scientist Dr. Anastasia Desyatova. The TAC will
support three projects by Research Project Leaders (RPLs) focused on the effects of sex on vascular
elastogenesis (RPL Majid Jadidi) and the development of devices for PAD surgical treatment and post-treatment
recovery using novel elastomeric bypass grafts (RPL Kaspars Maleckis) and ischemic wound dressings (RPL
Yury Salkovskiy). All three projects are based on solid preliminary data from humans and large animals and are
led by tenure-track Assistant Professors. Each RPL is mentored by two seasoned investigators: an NIH R01-
funded clinician-scientist to ensure translation, and a world-famous basic scientist from the RPL’s field of
expertise to advise on research strategy. The focus of our Center on research supporting the development of
devices and materials for vascular disease treatment is different from more traditional cellular and molecular-
based approaches and strategically utilizes our strengths in human artery biomechanics. With the help of the

Prevalent multidrug-resistant bacteria remain a significant threat to human health. About 1 million people,
including 214,000 newborn babies, die annually from such infections. Most antibiotics typically target essential
cellular components, enacting a high selective pressure that forces bacteria to develop resistance. This factor,
among others, led to dire statistical projections citing 10 million annual deaths by 2050, prompting a call-to-
action directed at tackling resistance through novel strategies. The most prominent bacterial resistance
mechanisms include genetically encoded efflux pumps, structural modification of antibiotics, or modification of
their molecular targets. Many target modification events follow well-established mechanisms catalyzed by
enzymes. For example, the documented loss of activity by multiple classes of antibiotics that target protein
synthesis is attributed to modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) through methylation by S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM)-dependent methylases. The Chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (Cfr) protein is a radical SAM-
dependent enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of adenosine 2503 (A2503) of 23S rRNA in the large subunit
of bacterial ribosomes, conferring resistance to several classes antibiotics that inhibit translation. The gene
encoding Cfr is found on naturally occurring plasmids across multiple pathogenic bacteria including
Staphylococcus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Listeria, and Bacillus species. This proposal focuses on developing
compounds that inhibit the activity of Cfr, thereby preventing bacteria from acquiring resistance through rRNA
methylation by this enzyme. These inhibitors will act as adjuvants that lack antibacterial activity but can restore
the activity of antibiotics affected by this resistance mechanism, when administered in combination. Cfr
inhibitors will be identified using a target-based approach involving computer-aided screens to be conducted
with virtual libraries of over 120 million commercially available compounds using the Autodock Vina software.
Compounds predicted to bind Cfr will be tested for their ability to bind the purified enzyme in vitro using
Temperature Related Intensity Change measurements and evaluated for their capacity to inhibit Cfr-mediated
methylation of a synthesized rRNA substrate in standard enzyme assays. Promising compounds will then be
tested in an E. coli resistance evolution model to assess the inhibition of Cfr activity in bacterial cells by
monitoring the antibacterial properties of antibiotics whose activity is abolished by the methylation of A2503.
When used in combination, compounds that block the activity of Cfr will result in restored antibiotic activity,
killing the bacterial cells. Inhibitors with this property will be co-crystallized with the enzyme to identify their
binding sites, and potential mechanism of inhibition of Cfr activity. These structural data will also be used in the
design of novel inhibitors with optimized binding affinities and adjuvant properties through fragment-based
drug discovery techniques and structure-activity relationship studies. Optimized adjuvants will be tested against
clinical isolates of bacterial species that employ this form of resistance mechanism."

Transgender youth with gender dysphoria are often treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
agonist to suppress sex steroids and pubertal development. However, there is little information available on its
effects on bone health in young peri-pubertal transgender youth. Sex steroid suppression can alter
mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate preferentially into adipocytes over osteoblasts, compromising
osteogenesis, bone formation, and bone density in both adolescents and adults. The current investigators have
previously demonstrated that adolescents with restrictive eating disorders and hypoestrogenism experience
bone marrow shifts from red (hematopoietic) to yellow (fatty) marrow with progression of disease. These bone
marrow changes may have adverse long-term implications for bone formation, bone accretion during
adolescence, and ultimately, lifetime skeletal health. Examining how bone marrow composition is altered after
pubertal blockade in transgender youth, and its relation to bone density, structure, and cross-sectional
geometry, could provide a mechanistic understanding of the effects of a GnRH agonist on a young, immature
skeleton. This proposal will examine the skeletal effects of pubertal blockade, the initial phase of transgender
medical management, prior to gender affirming hormonal therapy (estrogen or testosterone therapy). The
study will provide new insights on bone health in transgender youth, examining bone marrow composition via
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS). These results will be correlated with BMD
measurements obtained by the clinical assessment tool, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the
research tool, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). We will also address the clinically
relevant question of how bone marrow composition relates to bone density and skeletal strength in young
adolescents who are undergoing pubertal blockade. We will recruit a cohort of adolescents including those
assigned female at birth (AFAB) and assigned male at birth (AMAB), and matched healthy controls, and
examine bone marrow composition (by MRI/MRS), bone density (by DXA + pQCT), and bone structure and
cross-sectional geometry (by pQCT), before and after 12 months of pubertal blockade. This project will
leverage our large patient population as a two-site study in nationally recognized pediatric hospitals and our
extensive experience with DXA, pQCT, and MRI/MRS. In an exploratory aim, we will also consider the effect of
pubertal blockade on anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life. Findings from the proposed study
will allow us to identify preventive strategies to counter potential long-term adverse sequelae of pubertal
blockade such as early osteoporosis and fractures, raise awareness for providers of transgender youth, and
help guide monitoring after receipt of a GnRH agonist."

of functional proteins. This is achieved by the balanced actions of molecular chaperones to facilitate
folding, proteases to degrade misfolded and superfluous proteins, and stress-response signaling
pathways to regulate levels of chaperones and proteases. This protein quality control machinery
uses multiple layers of mechanisms to monitor the folding status of a proteome. Thus, the fate of a
given protein, whether it will fold or be degraded, strongly depends on the intrinsic folding properties
of the protein. While a majority of folding and degradation studies have focused on water-soluble
proteins, it is not well understood how the intrinsic folding properties of membrane proteins affect
their degradation. The knowledge gap mainly stems from inherent difficulties in studying membrane
protein folding in their native lipid bilayer environment as well as an insufficient understanding of
folding and sequence determinants for degradation. We use a combined model employing the
membrane-integrated ATP-dependent protease FtsH of E. coli as a model degradation machine,
and the intramembrane protease GlpG of E. coli as a model substrate, both of which are widely
conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We developed an array of methods to study
membrane protein folding in the bilayers based on the novel steric-trapping principle. We also
developed an in vitro bilayer system to study FtsH-mediated degradation of a membrane protein.
Using these methodological innovations, my vision for future research is to learn the generalizable
lessons of folding, protein-protein interactions and quality control of membrane proteins in the cell
membranes. We will delve into three unanswered problems: 1) What is the detailed molecular
mechanisms of FtsH-mediated membrane protein degradation? 2) Is the lipid bilayer a good solvent
for the denatured states of membrane protein or a poor solvent that promotes their nonspecific
collapse? 3) How do membrane proteins from thermophilic organisms achieve their unusual
thermostability and activity? If successful, the outcome of this study will advance our fundamental
understanding of mechanisms and energetics of membrane protein degradation, identify new
physical properties of the lipid bilayer that control folding and interactions of membrane proteins,
and discover new stabilizing motifs for membrane proteins that will provide a useful design and
engineering principle."

Chronic pain is second only to bipolar disorder as the major cause of suicide among all medical illnesses,
where prevalence of depression ranges between 30 to 80%. The importance of this negative affect is reflected
in studies that show co-existing psychopathology increases pain intensity, pain-related disability and
susceptibility for opioid use disorder. Allostatic adaptations caused by chronic opioid drug exposure, diminish
reward, however, paradoxically, they reinforce drug-seeking behavior that contributes to the high rates of
opioid misuse and development of opioid use disorder in chronic pain patients. One of the opponent processes
to chronic drug administration is engagement of extra-hypothalamic stress systems, including increased
activity of corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin within the extended amygdala (which includes the
central nucleus of the amygdala, CeA). The extended amygdala integrates stress and reward systems to
produce drug withdrawal-induced negative affective states. Additionally, the lateral CeA responds
predominantly to painful stimuli being termed the ‘nociceptive amygdala’ and a circuit from the parabrachial
nucleus to the CeA was recently shown to be involved in aversive learning of noxious (painful) stimuli.
Dynorphin neurons are present in the lateral CeA, of which ~1/3 co-express corticotrophin releasing factor.
This brain region has been implicated in both drug consumption and pain. For example, administration the
kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist nor-BNI into the CeA decreased excessive alcohol intake and chemo-
genetic silencing CeA dynorphin neurons reduced alcohol drinking. KOR signaling in the CeA was also shown
to contribute to chronic pain-induced aversion. Given the involvement of the CeA in aversive learning related to
ongoing pain, and the involvement of these neurons in drug-seeking behavior, the primary aim of our
application is to determine the extent amygdala KOR system contributes to increased drug-seeking behavior in
chronic pain. We will use a mouse model of opioid intravenous self-administration focusing on a reinstatement
paradigm that models relapse of drug-seeking behavior. This paradigm allows us to determine the extent KOR
systems contribute to stress-induced reinstatement. Our central hypothesis is that chronic pain states lead
to activation of KOR systems in the CeA that are involved in stress-induced reinstatement of opioid
drug-seeking behavior. Aim 1 of the proposal will determine the necessity and sufficiency of CeA dyn-KOR
system in negative reinforcement. Aim 2 will determine the sufficient and necessity of the CeA
dynorphin/kappa opioid system in reinstatement of opioid place preference. Aim 3 will determine the extent
stress-induced reinstatement of opioid self-administration is driven by the kappa opioid system in the CeA."
10794213,"BACKGROUND: The innate immune response in the CNS plays a critical role in disease progression in multiple
sclerosis (MS)/ experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Astrocytes, microglia, and pro-inflammatory
monocytes actively promote neurodegeneration, demyelination and scar formation, but therapeutic strategies
targeting glial cells remain elusive. Reactive astrocytes in EAE (here called the “EAE-astrocytes” for short) in the
spinal cord secrete numerous pro-inflammatory factors, with inhibition of each factor individually being beneficial
in EAE. Whereas targeting pro-inflammatory factors individually may be beneficial, a more promising strategy
may be to target the pro-inflammatory secretome of EAE-astrocytes more broadly. This idea emerges from
published work with the oral MS drug and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, fingolimod, in
which it was shown that astrocyte activation in the presence of fingolimod, yields a secretome that is less pro-
inflammatory. Our lab recently showed pathological involvement of Sur1-Trpm4 in MS/ EAE. During the chronic
phase of EAE, Sur1-Trpm4 channels are robustly upregulated predominantly by reactive astrocytes (EAE-
astrocytes), with global suppression of SUR1 reducing secretion of several pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines, and reducing clinical symptoms, demyelination and axonal loss. New experiments have
expanded on this work, revealing what may be a critical interaction between Sur1-Trpm4 and S1P signaling in
EAE-astrocytes. Preliminary data show that: (i) in EAE, Sur1-Trpm4, S1P1 and S1P3 receptors are highly co-
localized in EAE-astrocytes; (ii) in EAE, astrocyte-specific deletion of Abcc8, which encodes Sur1, yields a
secretome similar to that with fingolimod; (iii) in cultured astrocytes, Sur1-Trpm4 channels are downstream of,
and are required for, S1P signaling; (iv) in cultured astrocytes, Sur1-Trpm4 channels regulate the transcription
of numerous pro-inflammatory factors. Our central hypothesis is that Sur1-Trpm4 channels are required for the
S1P-mediated signaling that perpetuates the pro-inflammatory astrocytic secretome and contributes to disease
maintenance/progression in MS/ EAE.
DESCRIPTION: This project has three mechanistic aims, all focused on Sur1-Trpm4 in EAE. In Aim 1, we will
study myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35–55 EAE in male and female mice with genetic deletion of
Sur1 in astrocytes, initiated at different times after EAE induction, to establish the role of astrocytic Sur1 at
different stages of EAE. In Aim 2, molecular and patch clamp experiments will be used to demonstrate the role
of Sur1-Trpm4 in S1P signaling that regulates the secretome of activated astrocytes. In Aim 3, molecular
experiments will be used to characterize the role of Sur1-Trpm4 in regulating nuclear factor of activated T-cell
(NFAT)-mediated transcription of cytokines/chemokines in activated astrocytes. These studies will contribute
new mechanistic insights into the molecular interactions between Sur1-Trpm4 and S1P signaling in astrocytes,
and thereby reveal new treatment targets for MS."

The proposed research aims to measure blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals in white matter
(WM) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), validate their relationships to cortical neural activity,
and quantify their characteristics and their underlying biophysical origins. BOLD signals have previously been
robustly detected in gray matter (GM) in response to stimuli in a very large number of studies. In addition,
correlations of signal fluctuations between cortical regions in a resting state have been analyzed to derive
functional connectivity. However, whether such signals reliably arise in WM remains controversial, and their
interpretation is unclear. We have previously shown that BOLD signals can be reliably detected in WM if
appropriate detection and analysis methods are used, and that in a resting state they exhibit anisotropic
temporal correlations that largely align with WM tracts. Multiple such lines of evidence converge to suggest that
WM BOLD signals are related to intrinsic, function-dependent neural activity and are apparent only in tracts
engaged in specific functions. However, the precise relationships between WM and corresponding GM signals
have not been established, and neither the characteristics nor origins of the hemodynamic response function
(HRF) of WM have been elucidated. We hypothesize that BOLD signal variations in WM tracts are directly
related to corresponding variations in neural activity in GM volumes to which they connect and/or which share
specific functional roles, and that further studies will provide a new basis for more fully integrating structural
and functional aspects of neural organization. In the proposed research we will [1] demonstrate and measure
the relationships between BOLD signals in WM tracts (identified using diffusion imaging) and GM volumes in
response to parametric stimuli whose variations modulate the degree of neural activity in specific cortical
areas; [2] measure and characterize the HRF in specific WM tracts using event-related fMRI, and modify
conventional models of BOLD responses to explain and fit those data; [3] establish the biophysical basis of
stimulus-evoked BOLD activations in white matter by comparing data from different imaging sequences and
field strengths, and by measuring BOLD signals in the brains of non-human primates with and without an
intravascular susceptibility contrast agent to separate contributions from changes in blood volume vs blood
oxygenation. Overall, these studies will validate the nature of WM BOLD effects, demonstrate their relevance
in neural processing, and provide a basis for future studies of functional changes in a broad range of WM-
associated disorders as well as development and degeneration."

Mobilization of both adaptive and innate immune cells has considerable utility in the treatment of breast cancer
and other cancers. Here we provide a novel approach. Our central goal is to demonstrate how ablation of
the protein acyl transferase, DHHC3, can enhance both adaptive and innate anti-cancer immunity.
Towards achieving this goal, we have already shown that ZDHHC3 ablation i) markedly diminishes levels of
checkpoint blockade molecule PD-L1 on tumor cells, and ii) disrupts CMTM6, a molecule needed to maintain
PD-L1 expression, such that CMTM6 palmitoylation is abolished and subcellular localization markedly altered.
Furthermore, iii) restoration with wild type DHHC3, but not enzymatically inactive DHHC3, restores PD-L1
levels. In addition, iv) ZDHHC3 ablation markedly reduces tumor xenograft growth in nude mice (but not in
vitro) by a mechanism involving elevated oxidative stress, senescence, and tumor clearance by innate immune
cells. Because the DHHC3 enzyme may regulate both adaptive and innate anti-cancer immunity, but is not
needed for normal mouse physiology, it may be a useful therapeutic target. Our central guiding hypotheses
are i) that DHHC3 ablation prevents CMTM6 palmitoylation, leading to degradation of unprotected PD-
L1 on tumor cells, which enhances adaptive immunity and ii) that DHHC3 ablation also enhances
innate immunity, with key regulators of oxidative stress (e.g. ERGIC3, TXNIP) and innate immune cells
(e.g. NK cells) playing major roles. These hypotheses will be tested as follows: Aim 1, We will use a variety
of in vitro and in vivo experiments to establish the extent to which DHHC3 ablation enhances adaptive
immunity by a mechanism involving loss of CMTM6 palmitoylation leading to diminished PD-L1 expression.
Aim 2, We will assess relative in vivo effects of mammary tumor cell DHHC3 ablation on innate and adaptive
anti-breast cancer immunity, and we will evaluate key contributions of oxidative stress, senescence, and NK
cells to innate immunity. Expected Impact: Results should support the utility of DHHC3 as a novel tumor
target in breast cancer and other cancers, as DHHC3 ablation from tumor cells simultaneously enhances both
adaptive and innate immunity, with CMTM6, PD-L1, oxidative stress, and NK cells playing key roles."

Approximately 8.2 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds. Chronic wounds can be difficult to treat, and if
left untreated, they can lead to serious infections, tissue damage, and even amputation. Besides, the cost of
managing chronic wounds is very high – which requires frequent visits to healthcare providers, specialized
wound care products, and in some cases, hospitalization. This can place a financial burden on both patients and
the healthcare system. Blood perfusion, or the flow of blood to the tissues, is a critical factor in the healing of
chronic wounds. Chronic wounds often result from poor blood flow to the affected area, which can lead to a lack
of oxygen and nutrients necessary for the healing process. The long-term objective of this project is to improve
wound care and impact wound treatment services by developing low-cost technologies that aid with chronic
wound treatment and care. The primary objective of this application is to design, implement and validate
mHealth-based blood perfusion assessment tools to empower individuals with chronic wounds in daily life.
Building on our prior work, in this project we will enhance and validate a smartphone-based multi-spectral
imaging sensor to obtain perfusion-related measures (Aim 1), conduct a clinical study to validate mHealth-based
biomarkers with machine learning algorithms (Aim 2), and rigorously assess the tools in usability and learnability
(Aim 3). The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new mobile computing and data-driven
techniques for wound care and blood perfusion assessment based on evidence-based ground truth. It holds the
potential to advance the current standard of wound care for recovery after discharge from clinical therapies.
These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our society through
proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the subjective bias and financial burden for patients,
caregivers, and society."

 The ability of Borrelia burgdorferi to cause Lyme disease is highly dependent on its capacity to
establish a successful infection upon entering the mammalian host. Moreover, survival of the pathogen in
nature is completely dependent on its enzootic life cycle involving both a tick and reservoir host. The transition
between these two very different host types requires the ability to rapidly adapt through changes in gene
expression. Recent studies in our lab have provided evidence of the importance of lp17-resident genes for
plasmid copy number control and resultant gene dosage effects that may have significant roles in host
adaptation by B. burgdorferi. Despite this advance, there remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of
the functional and mechanistic aspects of currently identified lp17-encoded factors. The overall objective of this
application is to establish the functional outcome of lp17 copy number on gene dosage effects that correlate to
the ability of the pathogen to adapt to the host environment. Additionally, we aim to determine that mechanism
of action by the regulatory sRNA of lp17, SR0726, during host infection. Based on published and preliminary
data, the central hypothesis is that bbd21-22 are important for proper copy number control of multiple B.
burgdorferi plasmids that result in dosage effects of lp17-resident genetic factors important for host adaptation
and tissue colonization. The rationale for the proposed research is that the expected outcomes will significantly
advance our knowledge of the role that lp17 genes play in host adaptation by B. burgdorferi, and could
ultimately lead to the identification of potential targets for the development of a vaccine and/or therapeutics
against human infection. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH’s mission that pertains to
developing fundamental knowledge that will potentially help to reduce the burdens of human illness and
disability. Guided by our preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Establish the importance of bbd21 and bbd22 for copy number control of B. burgdorferi plasmids and gene
dosage effects, and 2) Determine the regulatory mechanism of SR0726 during host infection. Under the first
aim, the effects of bbd21 and/or bbd22 deletion on copy number control of plasmids other than lp17 will be
examined, the ability of BBD21 and BBD22 to interact assessed, and the capacity of BBD21 and/or BBD22 to
specifically bind DNA regions of multiple plasmids established. In the second aim, the approaches used will
include RIL-seq analysis of SR0726 binding to target mRNA, mutational analysis of predicted complementarity
binding regions of SR0726, and delineation of the upstream region necessary for regulated expression of
SR0726. The proposed work is innovative because it involves the first mutational analysis of these lp17-
resident genes in an infectious background strain to assess their mechanistic importance for both plasmid
maintenance and gene regulation. When applied, the knowledge gained from the proposed studies have the
potential to elucidate new drug targets to treat and prevent Lyme disease."

Bone regenerative biomaterials are of critical importance in treatment of bone defect, enhanced bone healing,
reduction of pain and disability, replacement of damaged or diseased bone, and development of new
orthopedic treatment options among others. With many years of endeavors, the field of orthopedic regenerative
biomaterials has seen tremendous progress, but many challenges remain. For instance, the currently available
bone regenerative biomaterials are featured with inabilities to mimic the native tissue composition, and slow
bone regeneration among others. The goals of this proposal are to elucidate an unexplored synergistic
optoelectrostimulation and metabonegenic regulation for bone development, and to translate these
understandings towards the design of novel biomimetic optoelectroactive citrate-presenting bone biomaterials
for orthopedic applications for promoted bone repair. The proposed optoelectroactive citrate biocomposites
(OCBs) that will enable synergistic osteopromotive effects between exogenous citrate supplement and in situ
electrostimulation by wireless untethered photo-illumination to provide increased cellular energy supply in
osteodifferentiated stem cells, as referred to a novel strategy of optoelectro-metabonegenic regulation. The
OCBs will allow for citrate release in a control rate and in situ optoelectrostimulation through µ-solar cell
pellets, where the µ-solar cell pellets will also be designed to be biodegradable to match the time frame of
bone regeneration."

Despite the prevalence of advanced age as a risk factor for many diseases, its features are rarely replicated in
experimental modeling of these diseases. Mimicking elements of aging is particularly rare in the in vitro
context, even though in vitro approaches can offer a degree of tunability and control that enable pursuit of
unique mechanistic, biological questions. Many diseases also present with sexual dimorphism, wherein men
exhibit different disease characteristics than women. Again, this element of sex-specific behavior is rarely
examined in the in vitro environment.
In aortic valve stenosis (AVS), advanced age and male sex are the top two risk factors; AVS also exhibits
sexual dimorphism in its presentation. The only approved treatment for this prevalent disease is surgical valve
replacement, a shortfall that is, in large part, due to our relatively poor understanding of its pathogenesis and
progression. Current platforms are not set up to query why aging is the strongest risk factor for this disease, or
why men exhibit difference pathology than women. Thus, we propose to create in vitro tissue-engineered
models that incorporate both age-related and sex-specific features in order to elucidate mechanisms
responsible for the onset of AVS hallmarks.
Specifically, we will: 1) Characterize age-related changes in valve structure and hemodynamics and create
corresponding engineered environments, 2) Evaluate the roles of cellular aging vs. environment aging in
sensitizing the valve to pathological stimuli, and 3) Determine how age-related sex hormone changes (and
cellular memory thereof) influence the valvular response to pathological stimuli.
This study will yield multiple advancements, particularly with respect to in vitro modeling of aging and
pathologies, and identification of the most influential age-related features that guide the responsiveness of
valve tissues to pathological stimuli. Such work has the potential to identify specific age-related changes and
signaling pathways that may be targets for intervention strategies to reduce AVS risk."
10794226,"The proposed study will develop a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) manual to address both
functional impairment and suicide risk (MBCT-S/P). We will examine the feasibility of the study design and ask
participants if the found the treatment to be acceptable. We expect this smaller study will provide critical
information for a larger trial.
 Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. Chronic pain is a leading cause of functional impairment in the
United States and is a risk factor of suicide even after accounting for psychiatric disorders. Veterans are a
vulnerable population for both suicide and chronic pain; however, there is little research examining ways to
reduce functional impairment and suicide risk in a combined treatment. Therefore, this proposal examines the
use of MBCT as a novel way to simultaneously address functional impairment and suicide risk. Research on
patients at risk of suicide and on patients experiencing chronic pain supports the utility of MBCT separately.
However, there is limited evidence investigating a combined treatment that addresses both functional
impairment and suicide risk. Application of MBCT on veterans at risk for suicide who are experiencing
functionally-impairing chronic pain provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously address these interactive
factors.
 The overall goal of the broader program is to enhance functioning and to reduce veteran suicide, and the
proposed project will provide data to guide the development of a larger trial. The objectives of the current
proposal are to (1) combine existing MBCT intervention protocols to develop an MBCT manual aimed at
addressing the unique needs of veterans experiencing functional impairment from chronic pain who are at risk
for suicide, (2) examine if the recruitment, retention, and treatment delivery is feasible and if MBCT-S/P
acceptable to participants, and (3) assess parameters of key outcomes among participants randomized to
receive MBCT-S/P versus an Education control to inform a subsequent larger clinical trial.
 To achieve these objectives, we will develop a manual through an evidence-based, iterative process then
conduct a randomized clinical trial in Veterans with chronic pain reporting suicidal ideation. We will randomize
a total of 76 participants to receive either MBCT-S/P or Education. We will assess pain and suicide risk
outcomes such as suicidal ideation, depression, and interpersonal factors at baseline and after the treatment
period. We will also track participant flow, therapist adherence to the manual, participant homework completion
and participant satisfaction with the treatment."

 Many young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) struggle with the complex daily demands of adherence to
their medical regimen and fail to achieve good glycemic control. However, few interventions have been
developed specifically for this age group. In the proposed study, we will provide an app (SweetGoals) to all
participants as a “core” intervention. The app prompts participants to upload their diabetes devices weekly to a
device-agnostic uploader (Glooko), will automatically retrieve uploaded data and apply decision rules about
daily and weekly self-management goals, and will generate feedback messages about goal attainment.
Further, the proposed study will test two unique intervention components designed to support and optimize
digital self-monitoring, goal setting, and goal achievement. These components include (1) incentives to
promote consistent daily adherence to goals, and (2) web health coaching to teach effective problem solving
focused on personalized barriers to self-management. We will use a novel digital direct-to-patient recruitment
method and intervention delivery model that transcends the clinic. Instead of relying on the clinic to transform
its system of care, our intervention will directly assist young adult patients in developing skills to improve their
utilization of the health care system. A prior pilot RCT (N=61) comparing this intervention approach to usual
care among adolescents showed significant and sustained impact on A1c. These results were very promising,
and we believe this intervention is well suited to young adults. In the proposed study, 300 young adults ages
19-25 with T1D and above target (Hb)A1c (≥ 8.0%) will be recruited via social media. All participants will
receive the SweetGoals app built on an open-source intervention platform MobileCoach (www.Mobile-
Coach.eu). The app automates many features of our piloted intervention, greatly increasing disseminability.
These include automatic retrieval of diabetes device data “digested” by Glooko and prompting and providing
feedback on adherence goals. Adherence targets include (a) daily glucose monitoring; and (b) mealtime
behaviors. A 22 factorial design will be used to test the main and interactive effects of (1) modest financial
incentives for meeting adherence targets and (2) web health coaching. Coaches will teach a problem-solving
approach that generates personalized solutions to adherence challenges. The intervention will last 6 months.
The primary outcome will be reduction in A1c. We hypothesize greater sustained A1c improvements in
participants who receive coaching and who receive incentives. Further, we hypothesize a synergistic
interaction between these components, resulting in greater positive outcomes among those receiving both. We
will also test four key self-regulation mechanisms and app engagement metrics as predictors of outcomes.
Successful completion of these aims will support dissemination and effectiveness studies of this intervention
that seeks to improve glycemic control in this high-risk and understudied population of young adults with T1D."
10794320,"SUMMARY:
My lab’s work has been at the forefront of studies showing that nuclear organization and long-range chromatin
interactions play an essential role in recombination and gene regulation. We combine molecular and imaging
(DNA/RNA FISH) approaches with in house generated computational pipelines, and are thus one of a handful
of labs that has expertise in both the experimental and analytical aspects of chromosome folding. In this
application we will extend our work to focus on two main interlinked problems of significant biological
importance: Project 1: Understanding bookmarking in the context of mitotic chromatin folding. In
mitosis (M), the promoters of M-phase active genes are “bookmarked” maintaining the accessibility of some
regulatory elements. This provides a mechanism for the rapid activation of a subset of genes, allowing cells
exiting from mitosis to preserve a memory of the epigenetic program of the previous cell cycle. Since
regulatory factors associate with chromatin with distinct affinities, some factors will be retained on M-phase
chromatin better than others, and furthermore, because binding occurs in a dynamic manner, sites at which
factors remain bound will not be uniform across a population of cells. The inefficiency of bookmarking,
combined with cell-to-cell variability, imparts daughter cells with a degree of epigenetic plasticity, enabling
them to alter their phenotype in response to environmental signals, which can have a significant impact on
developmental and biological processes. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this
process, and in particular how condensin II-mediated chromatin folding during mitosis impacts accessibility.
Project 2: Mechanisms underlying the chromatin organization and gene regulation of quiescent cells.
Cells can adapt and survive under conditions of stress, toxicity, nutrient or growth factor depletion/and
chemical insult, by exiting the cell cycle and entering a reversible dormant state known as quiescence (G0).
Previous studies showed that CTCF/cohesin-mediated TAD structure is restored after entry into G1, but
chromosome structure in mammalian G0 cells has not been studied carefully using modern molecular
methodologies. Gene expression is globally repressed in G0 cells, but we now know that quiescent cells
actively transcribe specific genes. Notably, chromatin in quiescent cells is predominantly compact, as in M
phase. Accordingly, we hypothesize that cells exiting M into G0 partially preserve the compact organization of
mitotic cells by retaining condensin II-mediated loops. The goal of our future studies is to determine whether
(i) condensin II binding at the start of M-phase functions to bookmark a subset of active promoters, (ii) whether
there is variability in the sites that are bookmarked between individual cells, and (iii) whether condensin II-
mediated chromatin looping and bookmarking are mechanistically linked to the unique genome organization
and transcriptional programs of G0 cells. Given our combined experimental and computational expertise in
the field of nuclear organization, we are uniquely positioned to address these timely, relevant questions."
10794323,"Project summary/Abstract: Enteroviruses (EVs) comprise a family of positive sense ssRNA viruses. The most
well-studied is poliovirus, yet non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) cause serious disease, especially in the very
young. This includes hand, foot and mouth disease, flaccid myelitis and encephalitis. Currently, it is estimated
that NPEVs are responsible for over 10 million infections and tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the US
alone. Furthermore, coinfections are common and therefore it is likely that new viruses will arise as a result of
recombination. Understanding key events that are shared across NPEVs is therefore key to being able to control
current infections and respond to emerging disease in the future. One of these key events is polyprotein
processing. The NPEV genome encodes a polyprotein which is proteolytically cleaved into the mature viral
proteins required for the generation of progeny virus. The structural region of the polyprotein is processed into
VP0, VP3 and VP1. These assemble into a protomer, five of which assemble into a pentamer. Twelve pentamers
coalesce around the viral genome, generating a structure termed the provirion. The assembly of the provirion
induces a series of conformational changes which result in the cleavage of VP0 into VP4 and VP2. This occurs
rapidly upon genome encapsidation, thus the provirion is short-lived and poorly characterized. The cleavage of
VP0 into VP4 and VP2 occurs within the assembled particle in an RNA-dependent manner and is a prerequisite
for EV infectivity. Understanding the provirion and characterising the key conformational changes which precede
VP0 cleavage is the focus of this application.
We propose that the mechanism of VP0 maturation cleavage is conserved across all EVs, and that
understanding this process will inform the development of future vaccines and anti-viral therapies. The current
model of VP0 cleavage and EV maturation is heavily based on data from poliovirus (PV), and suggest a catalytic
role for RNA in VP0 maturation. However, we hypothesise that genome packaging initiates conformational
changes which facilitate the formation of a proteinaceous catalytic pocket. We suggest that identifying allosteric
and catalytic changes which stabilize provirions will allow us to capture the molecular details of the catalytic site
at atomic resolution. Using a series of complementary techniques and a reiterative approach, we propose to trap
assembly intermediates and characterize the critical residues and conformational changes that mediate VP0
cleavage within the assembled virus particle. We will initially use EVA71 as our prototype NPEV and pan-EV
phenotypes will be confirmed by verifying findings in echovirus 7, poliovirus, and EVD68.
Our preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of generating mutationally-stabilized provirions with yields
suitable for structural studies. Additional data support the tractability of developing inhibitors of capsid assembly.
By these approaches we will define the conserved mechanism of VP0 cleavage which will be applicable to
treating both current NPEV infections and those yet to arise."

In South Africa (SA), depression is common in adolescents and has numerous immediate and long-term
negative consequences. High exposure to childhood adversity contribute to the mental health burden among
youth in SA. Cash transfer (CT) programs to alleviate poverty and its sequela are an essential part of
government social protection programs reaching millions of households in the African region. While there is a
growing body of evidence that CTs are associated with better mental health outcomes in adults, there is less
evidence as to the impacts among adolescents who have experienced childhood adversities. The overall
objective of this proposal is to determine whether, how, and under what conditions cash transfers
work to reduce depression among youth exposed to different adverse childhood experiences and
identify potential combination interventions that could work synergistically to promote health and well-
being among South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) with a high burden of
childhood adversity and depression. Using extant data from a rich longitudinal cohort combined with
community data sources, we propose a unique set of analyses to understand how CTs work to reduce
depression for adversity-exposed youth and improve later social outcomes. In Aim 1, we will identify whether
the longitudinal association between childhood adversities and depression differs depending on CT exposure.
We will first use data from a randomized conditional CT (CCT) trial conducted among AGYW in rural SA that
followed a cohort of 2,533 AGYW (HPTN 068, ages 13-20 at baseline) from 2011-2019. Depression was
measured six times over 8 years capturing a critical developmental period across adolescence into early
adulthood. Childhood adversities were assessed through community and family violence exposures, poverty
indicators, and low parental engagement. Using data from the Agincourt Household Socio-Demographic
Surveillance (AHDSS) in which the girls’ cohort is nested, we will also determine the impact of the government
of South Africa’s Child Support Grant (CSG), a monthly unconditional CT (UCT) provided to poor households
provided over time girls in the 068 cohort. In Aim 2, we will examine the processes linking adversities to
depression, including mediation through cognitive, emotional, and stress processes, and use moderated
mediation analysis to determine how CT exposure moderates these pathways. Finally, in Aims 3 and 4 we will
use causal inference models to explore how combining CTs with interventions on mediators of the adversity-
depression pathways could boost promotive impacts on depression and explore how reductions in depression
could reduce longer term social outcomes such as teen pregnancy, intimate partner violence, educational
attainment, and financial well-being. Taken together, we anticipate that findings from this robust set of analyses
will inform our understanding of how CTs may be leveraged to improve adolescent mental health."
10795047,"The transformation of a normal melanocyte into a melanoma requires factors above and beyond genetic mutations. We have identified lipids from subcutaneous adipocytes as one such contributing factor. When nascent melanoma cells come into contact with these adipocytes, they induce lipolysis and release of fatty acids into the extracellular space. These lipids are then directly taken up into the melanoma cell through FATP1 (Fatty Acid Transport Protein 1). Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with validation in human tissues, we show that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of FAPT1 interrupts the crosstalk between adipocytes and melanoma. Once inside the melanoma cell, these fatty acids undergo β-oxidation and can fuel tumor proliferation and invasion programs. One end product of this metabolism is the production of acetyl-CoA, which we find can be used to modify histone acetylation within the melanoma cell and lead to widespread changes in gene expression. Despite the importance of the interaction between adipocytes and melanoma cells, it is unknown what signals mediate this cross-talk, or how these lipids are used by the melanoma cell to drive progression. In this proposal, we will take advantage of the complementary strengths of the zebrafish model and human cell culture models to elucidate these mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will test whether catecholamines secreted from melanoma cells, which occurs as a byproduct of melanin synthesis can induce lipolytic programs in the adipocytes. In Aim 2, we will use the rapid transgenic capabilities of the zebrafish to test whether adipocyte-specific knockout of the lipolytic enzyme ATGL abrogates melanoma growth and progression. This will be complemented using an ATGL knockout mouse melanoma model. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the mechanisms by which fatty acid derived acetyl-CoA modulates histone acetylation and melanoma cell behavior. These studies will highlight the way in which factors such as lipids from the microenvironment can reprogram tumor cells to enable malignant transformation. Identifying these mechanisms will provide new opportunities for therapeutic targeting of this cross-talk."

This proposed research will elucidate the molecular basis of neuronal regulation of adult taste stem cells. Taste
organs degenerate in the absence of neuronal input, a phenomenon described more than a century ago, but
the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this are not well defined. We propose to use a combined in
vivo and in vitro approach to determine if R-spondin-2 (Rspo2), via interaction of its taste stem cell-expressed
receptors Lgr5/Lgr6 and/or Znrf3/Rnf43, is the gustatory-neuron-produced factor that maintains taste bud
integrity.
In Aim 1, we will determine if Rspo2 is required for taste bud maintenance. Using a loss-of-function approach,
conditional ablation of Rspo2 from gustatory neurons that innervate taste tissue will help determine whether
gustatory neuron-produced Rspo2 is necessary to maintain taste bud integrity. Conversely, in a gustatory
nerve transection model that leads to taste tissue denervation, we will determine if systemically supplied
recombinant Rspo2 via adenovirus and purified protein is sufficient for taste cell generation and taste bud
regeneration in the absence of gustatory innervation. The loss-of-function and gain-of-function will establish the
role of Rspo2 in neuronal regulation of taste tissue maintenance. In Aim 2, we will determine if Rspo2 interacts
with its taste stem cell-expressed receptors Lgr5/Lgr6 and/or Znrf3/Rnf43 to regulate taste stem cell activity.
We will use genetic approaches, Rspo2 mutants that selectively bind to Lgr5/Lgr6 or Znrf3/Rnf43, taste
organoid culture, and gustatory nerve transection to determine how Rspo2 acts.
Cancer patients who receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy often experience taste disturbance. The distortion
or loss of taste can lead to appetite loss and malnutrition. The mechanisms for drug-induced taste disturbance
are not clear, but dysregulation of adult taste stem cell activity could be the culprit. Accomplishing the aims
proposed here will be significant steps toward developing strategies for mitigating taste disturbances
experienced by individuals who suffer from taste loss or taste distortion."

Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response
to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from
University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar
Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida
Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning
Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the
work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic
notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and
approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium
components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and
6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2)
Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in
availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate
cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of
signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street
Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance
user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in
real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize
standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early
Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize,
coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings
quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System
(FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town
Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual
reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of
immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and
NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.
 NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is
NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US. It will provide evidence-based prevention and
intervention strategies to eventually reduce the harmful effects of substance use around the world."

Goals: The centromere serves as the binding site for the kinetochore and is essential for the
faithful segregation of chromosomes throughout cell division. The point centromere in yeast is
encoded by a ~115 bp specific DNA sequence, whereas regional centromeres span 6-10 kbp in
fission yeast to 5-10 Mbp in human. Despite the apparent diversity in centromere organization,
the distance between sister kinetochores in metaphase ranges from 800 nm to 1,000 nm in
yeast, worms, flies, flower moths, plants, horses and human. Understanding the physical
structure of centromere chromatin (pericentromere in yeast, defined as the chromatin between
sister kinetochores) will provide fundamental insights how centromere DNA is organized into a
stiff spring that resists microtubule pulling forces during mitosis.
Approach: Our laboratory develops computational tools to interrogate the structure and
dynamics of hundreds of kilobase pairs of pericentromeric DNA. Together with experimentally
obtained images of fluorescent probes of pericentromeric structure (e.g. pericentromere DNA,
cohesin, condensin) we make quantitative comparisons between simulations and experimental
results through transformation of in silico models into microscope images (model convolution).
We will test the proposal that the mechanism for building tension between sister kinetochores is
a chromatin bottlebrush organized by the loop-extruding proteins condensin and cohesin. The
bottlebrush provides a biophysical mechanism that transforms pericentromeric chromatin into a
spring due to the steric repulsion between radial loops. The bottlebrush as an organizing
principle for chromosome organization has emerged from multiple approaches in the field. We
will leverage the powerful features of chromosome engineering in yeast to explore the
consequences of reducing the number of centromeres, and exploit synthetic bottlebrushes and
statistical physics of polymer models to reveal basic principles linking bottlebrush structure to
the functional readout of force/tension.
Innovation: We will combine our experience in chromosome engineering and advanced
bioimaging in yeast with the expertise of collaborators in statistical physics and applied math
(Forest UNC-CH) and synthetic bio-inspired materials (Freeman UNC-CH). Testing our
hypotheses will elucidate important information about the organization and function of
centromeres, potentially providing a paradigm shifting foundation for the remarkable
conservation of distance between sister kinetochores throughout phylogeny."

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)–buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone–decrease illicit opioid
use, increase retention in treatment, and save lives. In the United States, 2.7 million persons live with opioid
use disorder and opioid-related overdose deaths totaled more than 80,000 in 2021. For patients taking MOUD,
and buprenorphine in particular, the treatment of acute pain after surgery is very challenging. Patients on
MOUD who use buprenorphine, as well as methadone, develop tolerance to opioid analgesics. Historically,
perioperative guidelines have advocated that patients temporarily discontinue buprenorphine before surgery,
out of concern that continuing buprenorphine would lead to escalation in opioid dosing and the inability to treat
acute pain after surgery. However, the national conversation has recently shifted with guidelines
recommending that buprenorphine, and to a lesser extent methadone, be continued in the perioperative
setting. The evidence supporting this change has relied on small samples, non-surgical cohorts, and studies
failing to examine relevant outcome for pain and opioid use disorder. As a result, clinicians currently operate in
a clinical and policy environment with no high-quality evidence supporting these conflicting guidelines on the
perioperative care for these vulnerable patients with opioid use disorder. Therefore, rigorous research on how
retention to therapies of buprenorphine, as well as the two other MOUD, influences outcomes after surgery is
critically needed. In this proposal, we will use several state-of-the-art national databases to achieve a better
understanding of perioperative management of buprenorphine and other MOUD. In doing so, we will examine
the consequences of buprenorphine therapy retention on opioid overdose risk and other relevant health
outcomes among privately insured, Medicaid, and Medicare patients under perioperative conditions. We will
focus primarily on buprenorphine, and also include methadone, naltrexone, and mixed MOUD use in this
analysis of patients aged 15 years and above, which accounts for age groups that experience high risk for
initiation of opioid use disorder (older adolescents) and rapid increases in opioid use disorder diagnoses (older
adults). In Aim 1, we will delineate variation in the impact of surgery on the retention of buprenorphine and
other MOUD therapies while providing the most up-to-date information on national patterns of MOUD treatment
retention after surgery. These analyses will also identify factors that predict retention of treatment after surgery.
In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether MOUD treatment retention after surgery is associated with postoperative
opioid prescribing and clinical outcomes. In Aim 3, we will assess whether MOUD treatment retention after
surgery is associated with reductions in opioid overdose events and mortality. Findings from this proposal will
inform efforts to optimize the perioperative management of buprenorphine and other MOUD, and accelerate
efforts to improve the perioperative care and reduce the negative consequences of opioid-related harms
among patients living with opioid use disorder."

Proper development and function of the neocortex, a brain structure critical for all higher-order functions, relies
on the tightly controlled migration of neocortical pyramidal (NP) neurons from their place of birth to their final
position in the developing neocortex. Once neurons reach their destination, they further mature and establish
functional connections. Significantly, defects in the migration of NP neurons are linked to neurodevelopmental
disorders (NDDs) of cognition and epilepsy, highlighting the importance of this process in neocortical
development and function. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that govern NP neuron migration and associated
brain disorders remain poorly understood. We recently uncovered that the multi-domain containing Rho-GAP
oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) is prominently expressed in NP neurons in the developing neocortex, and, importantly,
that it plays a key role in the proper migration and consequent positioning of newborn NP neurons in vivo. Notably,
mutations in OPHN1 cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability. Besides learning disabilities, affected
individuals typically exhibit epileptic seizures and behavioral/sensory deficits. These findings provide a unique
entry point for studying the mechanisms that control NP neuron migration and how such deregulation contributes
to common brain disorders. This application aims to define the underlying mechanisms by which OPHN1 governs
NP neuron migration, to elucidate how OPHN1 is regulated in such neurons, and to characterize how its loss
during embryonic development affects the cytoarchitecture/function of the postnatal/adult mouse neocortex and
the behavior of such animals. To this end, Aim 1 will define and characterize the cellular processes and effector
pathways OPHN1 impinges on. Our preliminary data suggest that OPHN1 exerts its effects via RhoA-dependent
and RhoA-independent pathways, each influencing distinct cellular aspects of NP neuron migration. Therefore,
we will delineate the RhoA effector pathway(s) involved and identify novel molecular interactions that mediate
OPHN1’s effects on NP neuron migration, using innovative genetic, molecular and cellular tools. Aim 2 will
investigate the mechanisms that regulate OPHN1 function in NP neurons, with a particular focus on the BDNF
receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, which we posit to act as key regulator of OPHN1 in NP neuron migration by
phosphorylating and consequently activating the protein. To test this, we will employ molecular/cellular tools and
genetic strategies to illuminate the mode of OPHN1 regulation by BDNF/TrkB signaling and address its functional
importance for NP neuron migration. Aim 3 will apply morphometric and electrophysiological techniques to
examine the morphology of NP neurons and neuronal/network activity in neocortices of juvenile/adult NEX-
Ophn1cKO mice lacking OPHN1 in postmitotic NP neurons. Furthermore, we will examine the behavior of NEX-
Ophn1cKO mice, with a particular focus on sensory-based and social/behavioral responses in addition to seizure
susceptibility. Together, our studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms governing NP neuron
migration and shed light on the pathomechanisms contributing to NDDs of cognition and epilepsy."

Diseases and Hematology/Oncology and scientifically trained in microbiology and immunology. Dr. Koh has
established a successful and independent research program focused on understanding how the gut microbiome
modulates host immune responses in cancer and stem cell transplant (SCT) patients. His experiences as an
active clinical oncologist and infectious diseases specialist, a basic/translational researcher, and mentor have
positioned him to be an ideal candidate for the K24 Mentoring Career Development Award. For this project, he
is particularly interested in using “reverse translational” approaches to identify unique gut microbiome signatures
associated with a particular disease phenotype in patients and then confirming causality in the laboratory using
preclinical and in vitro models. Hence, his research program is well-poised to further dissect and elucidate the
mechanisms by which specific gut microbiota modulate disease phenotypes in cancer and SCT patients with the
ultimate goal of devising novel therapies to modulate the gut microbiota and promote patient health. This work
has been supported by funding from the NIH/NIAID (K08 and R01), the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, private foundations, and industry. He has also developed a significant professional interest in
mentoring trainees in translational microbiome research and career development. The K24 award will support
Dr. Koh’s scientific career activities by allowing him to engage in professional development via
coursework/training and execution of novel projects that will enhance his research program and support future
independent funding. In addition to supporting scientific career activities, the K24 award will directly allow Dr.
Koh to pursue mentorship/leadership training and enhance his ability to more deeply engage with specific
mentees pursuing K and R01 awards and more broadly engage with all mentees in patient-oriented microbiome
research. The overall scientific aims of this proposal are 1) To mentor trainees to become patient-oriented
research investigators; 2) To continue and enhance my career development as a leader in translational patient-
oriented research; and 3) To conduct independent translational microbiome research to improve the health of
cancer and SCT patients with a focus on the following specific research projects: a) Mechanisms of gut
colonization resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens, with a translational focus on devising novel methods
to precisely edit the microbiome and prevent invasive bacterial/fungal infections; b) Gut microbiota-dependent
modulation of graft-versus-host disease; c) Mechanisms by which gut microbiota augment host anti-tumor

10795659,"Breaks in the structure of DNA are a persistent stress on the integrity of the genome, and they pose a
substantial risk of chromosomal rearrangement and genetic mutation that can challenge the well-being of an
organism and promote the development of cancer. There are several cellular mechanisms that monitor the
state of the genome and rapidly initiate repair mechanisms in response to DNA damage so that a healthy
genome is passed on to the next generation. Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1, or PARP-1, is a primary responder
to breaks in the structure of DNA. PARP-1 has a unique catalytic activity that synthesizes polymers of ADP-
ribose as a posttranslational modification on target proteins, primarily on PARP-1 itself (automodification).
Upon binding to DNA breaks, PARP-1 activity is “turned on” to modulate DNA damage repair pathways and
thereby promote cell survival. In contrast, excessive DNA damage leads to an elevated level of PARP-1 activity
that results in cell death. Regulation of PARP-1 activity is therefore a critical factor in determining the fate of a
cell. Importantly, inhibitors of PARP-1 (PARPi) have recently emerged as promising therapeutic agents for the
treatment of cancer and inflammation. Despite a growing interest in PARPi and the discovery of expanded
roles for PARP-1 activity in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and apoptotic signaling, there are still
limited insights into the mechanism of PARP-1 catalytic activity and regulation. The objective of this research
program is to fill major gaps in our knowledge of how PARP-1 is activated, modulated by a critical accessory
protein (HPF1), and subsequently silenced in the process of detecting DNA damage in healthy cells and how it
can be best inhibited by small molecules in current efforts to target PARP-1 in cancer and inflammation.
Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HXMS) and crystallography are the major
structural tools that we will apply to understand the impact of PARPi on PARP-1 dynamics and how PARP-1 in
the DNA damage response is initially activated and then subsequently silenced through automodification. The
structural and protein dynamics experiments will be combined with biochemical analysis of PARP-1 catalysis
and DNA binding, and cell-based analysis of PARP-1 function based on our structural and biochemical work. In
addition, medicinal chemistry will be employed to engineer allosteric PARP-1 “trapping” into PARPi
compounds in order to increase the efficacy of targeting this enzyme in the cancer clinic. Moreover, an
emerging PARPi-based imaging approach using established tumor assays with breast cancer patient-derived
xenografts will determine the degree to which the PARPi compounds that we generate engage/kill cancer cells
and impact survival of mice carrying tumor xenografts. The proposed studies of PARP-1 activity and regulation
will advance current models of PARP-1 biological functions and generate new small molecule tools that will
advance the understanding of PARP-1 biology and potentially represent new medicines for the cancer clinic."

Mortality from advanced prostate cancer remains a significant challenge facing clinicians due to the
incurable nature of the disease. PARP inhibition (PARPi) is a novel strategy for the treatment of prostate
cancer which exploits synthetic lethality by specifically targeting tumor cells which harbor DNA damage
repair defects. PARPi, including Olaparib, represent the dawn of precision medicine for the treatment of
prostate cancer and the strategy was approved in 2020. Despite this tremendous step forward, resistance to
PARPi has already been clinically documented. We have developed novel PARPi resistant cell lines, LN-
OlapR and 2B-OlapR, derived from LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines respectively. Our published
and on-going studies demonstrate that PARPi’s induce DNA damage leading to p53 activation and
subsequently to either cell death (cleaved-PARP) or p21-dependent senescence. RNA-sequencing of our
OlapR models versus parental cells revealed a shared and significant increase in IGFBP3 expression.
Preliminary data confirm overexpression of IGFBP3 in OlapR cells versus parental cells and shows that
inhibition of IGFBP3 reduces OlapR cell viability, increases DNA damage, and promotes the efficacy of
PARP inhibition. Our preliminary data also show that relative to parental cells, OlapR cells express
significantly higher levels of phosphorylated EGFR and DNA-PKc. Targeting EGFR by either its specific
EGFR siRNA or the small molecule inhibitor Gefitinib overcame olaparib resistance. The overall hypothesis
is that overexpressed IGFBP3 mediates resistance by enhancing DNA repair through formation of a
tripartite complex with EGFR and DNA-PKc, and blocking this signaling pathway by inhibiting EGFR activity
with Gefitinib overcomes resistance to olaparib. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. Define the role of
IGFBP3 towards promoting Olaparib resistance in resistant cells. 2. Determine if IGFBP3 promotes DNA
repair pathways in resistant cells. 3. Determine the anti-tumor response of targeting IGFBP3/EGFR in
combination with Olaparib. This proposal will address a significant unmet research need. We will study
novel models of PARPi resistance which will allow us to characterize mechanisms mediating PARPi
sensitivity. We will demonstrate the role of IGFBP3 as a key mediator of resistance and we will explore
novel therapeutic strategies which may be developed for clinical impact."
10796093,"Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with BRAF and MEK inhibitors has enabled
significant improvements in treating metastatic skin cutaneous melanomas that possess
activating mutations in the BRAF gene (“BRAF mutant melanomas”). In contrast, actionable
and specific targets in metastatic cutaneous melanomas that contain the wild-type BRAF gene
(“BRAF WT melanomas”) have yet to be discovered, hindering the development of more
effective strategies for treating these tumors. Here we propose to address that knowledge gap
by validating a candidate target in BRAF WT melanomas and strategies for therapeutic
intervention. Published and preliminary data have led to the following hypothesis: ERBB4
mutations or elevated ERBB4 transcription increase signaling by ERBB4-EGFR or ERBB4-
ERBB2 heterodimers, resulting in increased PI3 kinase signaling, cooperation with NF1 or
RAS gene mutations, and increased proliferation of BRAF WT melanomas. We will test
aspects of this hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) Which ERBB4 mutants found in BRAF
WT melanomas cause increased proliferation of BRAF WT melanoma cell lines? (2) Is
EGFR, ERBB2, or the PI3K pathway required for proliferation of the ERBB4-dependent,
BRAF-WT melanoma cell lines? We estimate that the predicted outcome of these studies will
lead to effective strategies for treating approximately 30% of metastatic BRAF WT
melanomas, revolutionizing the care of patients that carry these aggressive skin cancers."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This new application for the International Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies (ITAPS) program, University
of California, San Francisco will promote global HIV prevention research by enhancing the research skills and
experiences of scientists from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) currently engaged in international HIV
research networks. Previous ITAPS programs have trained 316 early career investigators from 55 countries
since 1989; trainees and alumni have cumulatively published over 4000 manuscripts. ITAPS has served as a
catalyst for many to pursue further training, develop successful research proposals, and become leaders in
their fields. The prevalence and incidence of HIV continue to be greatest in LMIC, and more trained local
investigators are still needed to develop, implement and test HIV prevention strategies taking local context and
culture into account. However, a large proportion of HIV research in LMIC continues to be spearheaded by
investigators from the US and other high-income countries. Early-career LMIC scientists may be hampered by
a lack of background in data analysis, manuscript writing, and long-term mentorship from their home
institutions. We will address these issues by providing a new component of applied research experiences and
mentoring activities for HIV LMIC investigators currently working within existing international HIV research
networks. The applied research experiences consist of hands-on experience performing secondary data
analysis of results from their primary research networks, supported by training in data management,
biostatistics, and interpretation of results, and using these analyses to develop manuscripts for publication in
peer-reviewed journals. We will also promote linkages and learning exchange between early-career UCSF
investigators and ITAPS scholars to foster mutually supportive collaborations. The mentoring activities consist
of ITAPS faculty closely mentoring trainees through in-person and distance one-on-one mentoring, as well as
training more experienced LMIC investigators to become mentors themselves, thereby building in-country
capacity. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To provide applied research experiences and research education for
LMIC early-career investigators. We will support LMIC trainees to learn how to develop research questions,
perform secondary data analysis and write manuscripts based on that data, using a combination of distance
learning, mentorship, UCSF-based and in-country workshops, and on-line modules. 2) To provide
mentorship activities for more advanced LMIC investigators. They will learn fundamental mentorship skills
and apply these skills by supporting ITAPS trainees. Mentors-in-training will conduct in-country or regional
workshops on data analysis, biostatistics and scientific writing, promoting local sustainability and multiplying
the number of people trained. Over 3 educational program cycles, we will enroll 12 mentors-in-training and 21
trainees. Our new training program builds on the success of former ITAPS programs by providing in-depth
training to prepare LMIC scientists to more independently and productively engage in research."

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, especially its LMIC countries, faces a myriad of
environmental and occupational health (EOH) challenges in a context of dynamic political changes, multiple
concurrent humanitarian crises, weak regulations, and limited investment in EOH research and research
capacity building. The American University of Beirut (AUB) in Lebanon (U01 application) is partnering with Yale
University (U2R application) in collaboration with the University of Iowa in the US to establish a Global
Environmental and Occupational Health Research and Training Hub for the MENA region (GEOHealth MENA),
where AUB serves as the Hub Institution and one university in each of Egypt and Sudan will serve as Spoke
Institutions. The aim of GEOHealth MENA is to build and strengthen EOH research capacity in the context of
disadvantaged populations, at AUB, sister institutions, and relevant NGOs in Lebanon and the MENA region.
The focus of the current project will be agricultural health and safety with an emphasis on exposure to pesticide
among refugee populations. The MENA region hosts more than 50% of the world’s total population of internally
displaced persons and refugees. The U01 application proposes to evaluate the pathways of pesticide exposure
among Syrian refugee agricultural workers, investigate the association of such exposure with neurobehavioral
outcomes, and explore the role of social factors in this association. Findings will inform policy and practice
guidelines that can improve the health of all agricultural workers. The multidisciplinary research team at AUB
will build on a strong track record of studying refugee and migrant populations and translating evidence into
policy. Yale and the University of Iowa will provide support to the AUB team in exposure assessment and the
assessment of neurobehavioral performance. The U2R will provide full scholarships to 3 highly qualified and
committed applicants (one from each of Egypt, Lebanon, and Sudan) to pursue a PhD in Epidemiology at
AUB’s Faculty of Health Sciences (FHS) focusing on EOH issues. The U2R will also provide full scholarships
to 4 highly qualified and committed MDs (two from Lebanon and one from each of Egypt and Sudan) to pursue
an MPH at AUB’s FHS and a fellowship in Occupational Medicine at AUB’s Faculty of Medicine. The 7 trainees
will spend 3 months (MD/MPH) or 6 months (PhD) during their study period at Yale and Iowa for advanced and
relevant research training and training on agricultural safety and health (AgS&H). Additionally, the U01/U2R
applications will offer short-term research and AgS&H training to the community."
10800402,"ABSTRACT
Although studied for decades, the physiological changes in the basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit that
underlie the development of motor signs of Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain under debate. Excessive
synchronization and coherence in neural activity has been demonstrated within the internal segment of the
globus pallidus (GPi) and between GPi - motor cortex (M1). However, the relationship of coherence within and
across subcortical-cortical regions to severity of motor signs of PD, specifically bradykinesia, is not well
understood. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the posterolateral sensorimotor region of GPi has been
shown to be an effective location for reducing clinical motor signs, however, there is debate around the optimal
subregion (e.g. ventral vs. dorsal) within GPi for stimulation. There is evidence that stimulating the
pallidothalamic pathway, specifically the lenticular fasciculus, is associated with improved motor severity. There
is also evidence that GPi-M1 coherence reduces with DBS and is associated with improved bradykinesia.
However, the relationship between pathways and neurophysiological activity, is unknown. This project will
explore the spatial distribution of pathophysiological activity within the GPi and across the pallidothalamocortical
network, how it modulates with movement and changes stimulation directed toward regions of GPi exhibited
relatively high level of coherence with M1. This information will provide the rationale for the development of
precise, patient-specific stimulation paradigms and lay the groundwork for novel closed-loop stimulation
algorithms. The goals of this study are: 1) to describe the characteristics of low/high beta and high
frequency oscillations that underlie bradykinesia. 2) describe the characteristics and dynamics of
coherence in the beta band between GPi-M1 and their relationship to quantified measures of
bradykinesia, and 3) describe the relationship between pallidothalamic pathway activation and measures
of bradykinesia using real-time measure of GPi-M1 coherence to direction stimulation in GPi. This project
will leverage access to recordings in the operating room during DBS lead implant surgery to record simultaneous
local field potentials (LFP) from microelectrodes, segmented DBS leads and electrocorticography (ECoG) strips
while the patient performs a self-initiated reach-to-target task in order to examine the modulation of GPi-M1
coherence during movement (SA1,2). We will use high field 7T imaging and biophysical computational models
to correlate activated pallidothalamic pathways to changes in quantified measures of bradykinesia using real-
time measures of GPi-M1 coherence to direct stimulation toward regions of GPi showing relatively high or low
GPi-M1 coherence while the patients performs a self-initiated reach task (SA3). This study will provide the
rationale for precise biomarkers and pathway-based stimulation targeting within the sensorimotor region of GPi,
developing patient-specific closed-loop algorithms and incorporating spatially localized pathophysiological
activity into model-based programming."
10800405,"Respiratory viral pathogens have been responsible for major pandemics over the past two centuries with
extraordinary human and economic cost. While most vaccines have focused on antibody neutralization of
virus, there has been growing interest in targeting CD8 T cell immunity for more durable protective immune
memory. Specifically, there has been interest in vaccines that generate tissue resident memory T cells (TRM),
but one issue complicating this approach is the observed lack of durability of lung TRM, whether generated by
pulmonary viral infection or targeted vaccination. Unlike TRM in other tissues, which accumulate and survive for
years, lung TRM have half-lives measured in days. We have discovered an alternative population of CD8 TM that
can mediate lung-focused T cell memory and protection from morbidity and mortality after skin vaccination.
The durability of this immunity appears to be provided by a unique population of lung tropic CD8 T cells
concentrated in the intravascular space of the lung (rather than the parenchyma). Using IAV as a model viral
respiratory pathogen, these CD8 T cells appear to rapidly extravasate and enter lung parenchyma within hours
after infection, providing a rapid on demand protective memory response with kinetics comparable to lung TRM.
Their activity does not require CD4 T cells, and elimination of these CD8 TM cells completely abrogates robust
vaccine protection. Analysis of these cells by scRNAseq reveals that they have circulatory markers, but also
immediate-early genes reminiscent of skin TRM generated from the same vaccination. They are transcriptionally
distinct from spleen TEM and LN TCM generated by the same vaccination and appear to be robust >6 months
later. Most importantly, they provide complete protection from morbidity and mortality from viral lung challenge
and function independently of antibodies and B cells. Using defined genetic models, scRNA seq, ATACseq,
multidimensional flow cytometry, and lung intravital microscopy, we will test key hypotheses about the mode of
generation, in vivo biological behavior, and protective immunity of these cells. We have assembled expert
collaborators in each of these areas to fully explore the biology of these cells and the potential of generating
these cells by epidermal disruption (ed) vaccination. We believe that these TM cells are an important and
unstudied component of normal T cell memory designed to provide superior and long-lasting lung immunity
without occupying valuable lung parenchymal space. We believe that optimized generation of these cells by
improved vaccination approaches will provide a superior way to combat respiratory viral pathogens."
10795907,"Project Summary/Abstract
Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a debilitating condition that particularly plagues aged individuals
(~40% of elderly surgical patients develop POCD). POCD substantially increases the risk of morbidity, mortality,
and the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Inflammation in the brain (“neuroinflammation”), which becomes
more excitable or “primed” with age, may cause POCD. Indeed, substantial changes in the immune system occur
with age and the immune system communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) and alters the function
of local CNS immune cells such as microglia. In modern society, unusually clean conditions decrease exposure
to environmental and commensal microorganisms that help shape immunoregulatory circuits. Reintroduction of
microorganisms in an overly sterile environment can improve immunoregulation and quell hyperactive
inflammatory responses. Despite the therapeutic potential of specific small microbes, few studies have assessed
whether microbial-based treatment strategies target the CNS and are effective in aged populations. One such
microbe that could benefit neuroinflammation in aging is the widely distributed soil bacterium Mycobacterium
vaccae (M. vaccae), which is approved for therapeutic use in humans and improves quality of life in other
contexts (allergy and cancer). Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that M. vaccae immunotherapy
(three subcutaneous injections) will protect against primed neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in aged rats
following surgery. Our preliminary results indicate that M. vaccae immunotherapy has robust and sustained anti-
inflammatory activity (+IL-4) in the CNS of aged rats and blocks persistent pro-inflammatory responses (IL-1β)
and cognitive deficits following surgery. M. vaccae appears to induce a beneficial (anti-inflammatory) CNS
response and redirect the activation state of microglia. M. vaccae enhances immunoregulation in the body
through altering T cell populations and may shift the population of T cells accessing the CNS and surrounding
meningeal space to elicit changes in the CNS. Thus, this proposal addresses the following specific aims: first,
establish whether M. vaccae is a viable pre-clinical target for preventing age-associated POCD; second, identify
the CNS-specific mechanisms by which M. vaccae induces a sustained protective shift in the aged neuroimmune
environment; and third, establish how M. vaccae communicates its anti-inflammatory signal to the brain. This
research is innovative: microbial-based treatments can effectively improve peripheral inflammation, yet there is
almost no research investigating whether microbial-based treatments can protect against damaging
neuroinflammation. Our overall long-term goals are to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying neuroinflammatory priming; to understand how microglia function transitions toward pathological
responses with age; and to determine how these neuroimmune alterations hijack behavioral function."

For the past 6 years, my independent laboratory has leveraged new approaches in human genomics and
pioneered new types of post-genomic functional studies—empowered by genome-editing technologies—to
elucidate novel mechanisms that drive cardiovascular diseases. My laboratory has characterized the roles of
specific genes involved in lipid metabolism, coronary heart disease, and diabetes, as well yielding insights into
how noncoding DNA variation influences the functions of these genes. Going forward, my research will take
advantage of recent advances in disease modeling and therapeutic genome editing—advances in which my
laboratory played a part—to tackle two exemplary translational challenges in the cardiovascular field: (1)
the use of therapeutic genome editing to prevent coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death
worldwide; and (2) the use of genome editing to empower high-throughput functional annotation of variants
of uncertain significance detected in patients by clinical sequencing."
10798299,"Project Summary
 Mammalian and most other eukaryotic genomes contain a large number of interspersed repeats (IRs), most of
which are copies of transposable elements (TEs) at varying levels of decay. Their presence complicates many
genome sequence analyses, but their accurate identification in an early analysis stage can reduce these
complications. In addition to their pervasiveness, over the last decades the research community has become
widely familiar with their enormous impact on genome activity and evolution.
 Every species has been exposed to a unique, complex set of TEs leaving recognizable copies from as long
ago as 300 million years to as recently as the present day. These TEs are uncovered and reconstructed by de
novo discovery methods, often by our RepeatModeler tool, while their copies are then annotated by our
RepeatMasker software. De novo methods can create TE libraries at a reasonable pace, but the product is far
from the desired quality that can be reached by hand curation. With the recent explosive growth in sequenced
species, these finishing steps, perhaps never fully automatable, now form a severe bottleneck in genome
analyses due to a lack of manpower and expertise, while the results, especially when produced by different
methods from different research groups, lack consistency and suffer from redundancy. Furthermore, the
annotation of genomes for which high-quality libraries have been created is not keeping up with library
improvements due to the computational burden of re-analysis.
 In this proposal, we describe a plan to refactor RepeatMasker by generalizing and improving TE alignment
adjudication, switching to a family-centric search strategy with support for incremental re-analysis, improving
annotation reporting and supporting cluster environments. Responding to the need for improved methods for
automated TE library generation we propose making significant changes to RepeatModeler’s core discovery
algorithms, develop a novel model extension tool, and. In addition, we will extend our novel methods for
exploiting multi-species alignments and ancestral reconstructions and utilize them to build a comprehensive
mammalian TE library."
10798300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurological injury that results in the loss of communication is devastating. This proposed pilot trial is designed
to evaluate the feasibility of speech prosthetic technology in a small cohort of paralyzed patients. We will leverage
a decade-long scientific investigation of the functional properties of human speech motor cortex, and recent
demonstration of speech decoding in normally speaking patients implanted with electrodes (for epilepsy surgery
planning). We propose an early feasibility study of a long-term direct neural interface for restoration of
communication. We propose three critical innovations to achieve this goal: 1) a chronically implanted high-
density 128 channel electrocorticography (ECoG) array which samples from the entire lateral motor cortex
(including speech motor cortex), 2) application of state-of-the-art neural network decoding approaches, and 3)
direct comparison of text and speech synthesis decoder approaches. Electrocorticography is a method of
recording neural activity (local field potentials) from the brain surface using non-penetrating electrodes. We
hypothesize that ECoG may have distinct advantages for clinical application over current alternatives (e.g.
microelectrode or scalp EEG) given that we can achieve both high-density sampling and cover the entire speech
motor cortex. We have previously demonstrated that this scale and coverage is necessary and sufficient to
decode speech in intact individuals. ECoG has an increasing well documented safety and reliability profile for
long-term implantation in human medical applications such epilepsy and brain computer interfaces. We have
already de-risked regulatory hurdles with FDA IDE and local IRB approval for investigational use. The primary
goals of the study are to enable communication via text and synthesized speech decoded from neural signals.
The secondary goal is to demonstrate the robustness and stability of ECoG-based recordings in the chronic
implantation setting. These aims will determine the feasibility of speech neuroprosthetic technology in target
population of patients who are paralyzed."
10798301,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 The overall goal of this application is to develop, implement and test a “single button push”, integrated
combination of innovative MRI solutions to enable widespread and generalizable implementation of quantitative
evaluation of chronic liver disease in < 5 minutes. We aim to design a reliable, efficient, low variability, and fully
automated, MRI exam. This goal will be enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), reengineered chemical shift
encoded (CSE)-MRI to provide “error-free” free-breathing measurement of liver fat and iron, an innovative MRI
suite design, and automated analysis. In this way, we aim to achieve high-throughput, low-cost evaluation
of liver disease with high accuracy, precision and reproducibility. Abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in
hepatocytes, or steatosis, is the earliest feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affecting ~100
million people in the US. Liver iron overload is common in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and those
receiving repeated blood transfusions. Early, affordable, and accessible non-invasive detection and quantitative
staging of liver fat and iron would impact the health of millions of people at risk for NAFLD and its comorbidities,
as well as those with liver iron overload. Confounder-corrected CSE-MRI provides simultaneous estimation of
liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2*, which are accurate, precise and reproducible biomarkers of liver
fat and iron. A primary determinant of the cost of MRI is scheduled MRI suite time. Minimum slot times to
accommodate the majority of patients are driven by variability in exam duration and MRI suite turnaround time.
As MRI scan times are shortened, the largest contributor to exam duration is the time needed for i) manual image
prescription, ii) repeated scans (rework), and iii) room turnaround time. Many patients, including children, are
unable to hold their breath for the duration of CSE-MRI (~20 seconds) leading to ghosting artifacts that corrupt
PDFF / R2* maps, necessitating repeated CSE-MRI acquisitions and exacerbating exam time variability. We will
address these challenges by developing fully automated AI-based image prescription based on multi-center,
multi-vendor data at 1.5T and 3T, in parallel with a novel “error-proof” high SNR “snapshot” CSE-MRI method
that is insensitive to breathing motion. This will be performed using a novel MR “Smart Suite” design, capable
of patient turnaround in less than 2 minutes, followed by automated quantitative analysis and reporting. We
will implement and test a fully automated, single button push CSE-MRI exam by aiming to: 1). Develop and
optimize motion insensitive, high SNR, free-breathing CSE-MRI for accurate and precise measurement of PDFF
and R2*, 2). Confirm the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of the proposed CSE-MRI method in patients
with liver fat and iron overload, and 3). Implement and validate a fully automated CSE-MRI protocol in less than
5 minutes of MR room time. If successful, this work will provide a high-throughput, high value solution for liver
fat/iron quantification. The innovations proposed in this application will also have broad applicability beyond
CSE-MRI, and ultimately reduce cost and increase access, through improvements in MRI scanner utilization."
10790272,"Interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy for transabdominal fetal oximetry
The outcomes and cost of childbirth is an important issue that almost every family faced or will face. Compared
to vaginal delivery, Cesarean section (C-section) has a higher cost, and may increase the health risk to both the
baby and mother. About 32% of the deliveries are via C-section, which is much higher than the 10-15% ideal
rate published by World Health Organization. A major triggering factor of C-section is a conservative prediction
of fetal hypoxia during labor, which unfortunately has a high false-positive rate using the existing, widely-adopted
intrapartum fetal monitoring technique of cardiotocography (CTG). Strikingly, since the introduction of CTG in
the early 1970s, the rate of C-section deliveries in the US has risen five folds, while the rates of conditions
associated with hypoxia remain unchanged. A noninvasive measurement of the fetal oxygen saturation during
labor and delivery could provide obstetricians specific indicator of the necessity of emergency C-section. This
may help to reduce the rate of unnecessary C-sections.
Here, we propose a new transabdominal fetal oximetry (TFO) technique based on an innovative interferometric
near-infrared spectroscopy (iNIRS) approach that could noninvasively measure the fetal arterial blood oxygen
saturation. The iNIRS TFO measures the time-resolved reflectance of near-infrared light shining on the maternal
abdomen. Our new method is distinctly different from the conventional pulse oximetry, and offers critical
advantage to detect weak fetal signals buried in strong overwhelming maternal signal through the abdomen while
greatly reducing the required light power on the tissue. Our approach distinguishes photons traversing different
tissue depth, thus facilitating the separation of signal between the shallow maternal layer and the deep fetal layer.
It greatly increases sensitivity to deep tissue signals and assures both an accurate and safe measurement.
We conducted preliminary experiment on pregnant ewe and verified our technique could detect the fetal
heartbeat through a single optical wavelength and a single detector, which presages the feasibility of iNIRS to
measure fetal oxygen saturation. Here, we aim to build a two-wavelength iNIRS with a significantly improved
measurement sensitivity to perform transabdominal fetal oximetry. The two optical wavelengths could extract the
relative change of the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during a cardiac cycle, and we will use time-
division-multiplexing to switch between two optical wavelengths in the iNIRS setup. To improve the tissue
penetration depth, we will increase the frequency tuning rate of the laser, use an innovative detection fiber and
increase the number of detectors. All these approaches could increase the measurement sensitivity and thus
the accessible tissue depth. Finally, we will develop advanced machine learning algorithms to extract the fetal
oxygen saturation level from the raw measurements. We will perform the experiment in pregnant ewe model and
validate the results with the arterial blood gas (ABG) test. The success of our project will make a significant
impact on both the outcomes and cost of childbirth."
10918302,"Abstract/Project Summary
Impairment of microcirculatory blood flow has been implicated as a pivotal pathophysiologic event in acutely
critically ill patients. As the brain is particularly sensitive to insufficient perfusion, cognitive impairment,
particularly in the elderly, can prolong the recovery period and significantly impact the ability to live independently.
Resuscitation or perfusion management in critically ill patients is primarily guided by macrocirculatory
assessment (i.e., arterial blood pressure (ABP)) with little consideration of the microcirculation, as
microcirculatory parameters are technically difficult to assess. Such practice operates under the assumption that
resuscitation aimed at correcting macro-hemodynamic variables is also effective in correcting microcirculatory
perfusion and oxygen delivery to the brain tissue, a relationship termed hemodynamic coherence. However,
recent studies in pathophysiologic states (e.g., sepsis, shock) strongly suggest that microvascular perfusion is
not restored despite the optimization of macrocirculatory parameters. Thus, there is an urgent need to learn
what governs cerebral microcirculatory flow, dissect conditions that compromise hemodynamic coherence and
define effective microcirculation resuscitation targets. Further, while research tools exist, there is no commonly
accepted technique which can measure microcirculation through the intact skull. Therefore, it is essential to
identify more accessible microcirculatory beds (e.g., sublingual, retinal) which may serve as surrogates for
cerebral microcirculatory flow. Characterizing surrogate microcirculations as flow-biomarkers is a critical step
towards practical clinical implementation of microcirculatory targets for resuscitation. Our long-term goal is to
develop effective strategies to enhance microcirculatory perfusion and effective oxygen delivery to the brain
under critical clinical conditions that require resuscitation. The primary goals of this proposal are to a) investigate
the role of the microcirculation in cerebral hemodynamic coherence in the gyrencephalic brain and b)
characterize effective cerebral microcirculation proxies that can be developed as non-invasive surrogate
biomarkers for bedside clinical management. We will manipulate cardiovascular physiology reflecting common
intraoperative scenarios (i.e., hemorrhagic hypotension) and hypothesize that current resuscitation strategies, in
particular the use of high concentrations of vasopressors, do not restore microvascular function but lead to long-
lasting cerebral microvascular constriction and result in brain injury. In Aim 1 we will assess cerebral
hemodynamic coherence and oxygen delivery during induced hemorrhagic hypotension and resuscitation using
multimodal microvascular imaging techniques. In Aim 2 we will determine the relationship between a) sublingual
and b) retinal and cerebral microcirculatory dynamics and investigate their potential as surrogate biomarkers for
bedside cerebral microcirculation perfusion management. Successful completion of this project will delineate
resuscitation strategies that maintain microcirculatory perfusion and characterize surrogate microcirculations that
can be monitored non-invasively and thereby help minimize brain injury."

The goal of the project is to understand the genetic basis and evolution of thermotolerance in the
Saccharomyces species. Whereas much has been learned about the causes of phenotypic variation
within species, reproductive barriers have limited genetic analysis to closely related, inter-fertile
species. Consequently, we know little about the genetic basis of substantial phenotypic differences
that arise over longer time periods and the importance of evolutionary hotspots and historical
contingency. To overcome this reproductive barrier we will use hybrid, proteomic and transgenic
analysis of yeast species. In Aim 1 we will map thermotolerance in interspecific hybrids using
reciprocal chromosome loss and CRISPR induced mitotic recombination. This will enable us to
measure the combined effects of many genes, but also identify thermotolerance genes and determine:
whether they evolved through the cumulative effects of multiple changes, and whether their effects
depend on changes in other genes. In Aim 2 we will investigate divergence in protein thermal stability
and whether it results in temperature dependent fitness effects not detected by mapping. In Aim 3 we
will examine the reuse of thermotolerance genes during thermal divergence along independent
lineages. Doing so will determine whether thermal divergence requires certain genes or can be
achieved in different ways. Together, these aims will push the limits of interspecific genetic analysis in
order to provide insight into the acquisition of a complex and broadly relevant phenotype that has
taken millions of years to evolve."

Discovery and validation of strong candidate biomarkers and clinical endpoints for pain is urgently needed that
can be used to facilitate the development of non-opioid pain therapeutics from discovery through Phase II clinical
trials. Emerging research using a combination of biomarkers deliver individualized predictions about future brain

multiple biological biomarkers where a greater pain burden is associated with accelerated detrimental biological
processes. However, prospective research is urgently needed to determine pain’s impact on the heterogeneity
of these biological processes within an individual to elucidate the underlying patterns of biological changes using
a biobehavioral perspective which is needed for predicting future health and to be able to use as clinical
endpoints for interventions. The proposed study will prospectively address biobehavioral factors (i.e., cognitive,
psychological, social and cultural) affecting the experience and interpretation of knee pain and physical function
across racial/ethnic groups over time. We will prospectively assess pain along with multiple biomarkers as
predictors of cognitive, psychological and physical functional progression among middle-aged and older non-
Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites with knee pain and controls over a four-year study period. With strong
support from the University of Florida, our interdisciplinary project, using a comprehensive biobehavioral multi-
methods approach, we will be the first to prospectively determine the trajectory and interactions among pain,
biological biomarkers and multiple domains of function within race/ethnic groups in OA pain. Findings will
contribute towards increased understanding of pain and its biobehavioral basis, with the potential to reduce
race/ethnic group disparities and improve pain-related health and functional outcomes."

Vaccines are the greatest bang for our public health buck, yet vaccine development is still sometimes hit or miss.
Recent efforts with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that acceleration of vaccine programs is possible, especially
when supported by prior studies characterizing successful immune responses against related prototype
pathogens. The measles virus vaccination campaign is a global success story; the live-attenuated vaccine
developed in the 1960’s still elicits highly protective antibodies to strains circulating today. Yet Measles outbreaks
persist due to obstacles in vaccination programs such as global health inequities, vaccine hesitancy, extreme
weather events related to climate change, and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, a growing population
with compromised immune systems cannot receive live-attenuated viral vaccines. Thus, the threat of measles
remains (there are still approximately 9-10 million cases annually), and innovative solutions will be needed to
achieve global measles eradication. However, very little is known about the human antibody response to measles
infection or vaccination beyond neutralizing antibody titers. Importantly, there are no structures of any antibodies
in complex with any measles virus antigens. As a result, we do not know which sites on measles virus are
immunodominant and protective. Much of this fundamental knowledge is lacking largely because measles was
effectively eradicated from developed nations before needed scientific tools had been developed. In this work,
we will use state-of-the-art tools to directly visualize the structure of human antibodies from vaccinee polyclonal
sera bound to measles surface glycoproteins to understand which antigenic sites dominate in the human
vaccinee response. We will also use microfluidics and rapid microscale multiplexed competition analyses to
rapidly discover and analyze individual human monoclonal antibodies against measles virus for the first time.
This work will reveal what components of the human immune response to this prototype paramyxovirus lead to
vaccine-mediated protection, and will help guide development of modern vaccines for the immunocompromised
and other vaccines against paramyxoviruses yet to emerge."

There is emerging evidence that cancer and its treatments may accelerate the normal aging
process, increasing the magnitude and rate of decline in functional capacity. This accelerated
aging process is hypothesized to hasten the occurrence of common adverse age-related
outcomes in cancer survivors, including loss of muscle mass and decrease in physical function.
However, there is no data describing age-related loss of muscle mass and its relation to physical
function in the long-term in cancer survivors. This project will directly address three key
methodological challenges in research on cancer survivorship: 1) obtaining accurate measures
of skeletal muscle mass in large population-based cohorts of community dwelling older adults, 2)
disentangling the effect of age versus cancer on the relationship between muscle mass, physical
function (gait speed, balance, strength), and functional decline, and 3) the large sample size
required to understand predictors of low muscle mass using big data (machine learning)
approaches. The D3-creatine dilution method (D3Cr) will be used to obtain a direct measure of
muscle mass remotely, using a protocol that has been previously validated in clinical and
epidemiologic research. This study will measure D3Cr muscle mass in 6614 participants (3044
cancer survivors and 3570 cancer-free controls) in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), a large
prospective cohort study (n=161,808) of postmenopausal women with over 25 years of follow-up.
Participants will be drawn from two sub-cohorts embedded within the WHI using an incidence
density sampling approach. Cancer survivors will be drawn from an existing NCI-funded
survivorship cohort, the Life and Longevity After Cancer (LILAC) cohort, and cancer-free controls
will be drawn from the WHI Long Life Study 2. The overall objective of this application is to
examine the antecedents and consequences of low muscle mass in cancer survivors, using
innovative methods to overcome major sources of bias common in cancer research. The study
aims are to: 1) create age-standardized muscle mass percentile curves and z-scores to
characterize the distribution of D3- muscle mass in cancer survivors and non-cancer controls, 2)
compare muscle mass, physical function, and functional decline in cancer survivors and non-
cancer controls, and 3) use machine learning approaches to generate multivariate risk-prediction
algorithms to detect low muscle mass. This project addresses an urgent need identified by the
NCI for research in older and long-term cancer survivors. The results of this study will be used to
develop interventions to mitigate the harmful effects of low muscle mass in older adults and
promote healthy survivorship in cancer survivors in the old (>65) and oldest-old (>85) age groups."
10794242,"SUMMARY. Objective: The objective of “Research Opportunities for Undergraduates: Training in
Environmental Health Sciences (ROUTES)” renewal is to continue to inspire and develop scientists, engineers
and other related researchers from underrepresented backgrounds to be engaged in the increasingly complex
field of environmental health (EH) research. ROUTES will achieve this by providing underrepresented minority
(URM) undergraduate students with basic and translational research experiences in diverse topics in EH fields.
Our focus on EH is driven by the importance and relevance of this topic to disproportionately affected URM
communities, the lack of representation of URMs in EH fields, and the complex, collaborative and
interdisciplinary nature of EH research. Approach: We will establish a multidisciplinary, undergraduate,
program centered around basic and translational research in EH disciplines that draws from and leverages
Northeastern’s (NEU) strong cooperative education curriculum and support structure. We will provide
meaningful research experiences through established partnerships in industry, government and non-profit
sectors, as well as through on-campus, funded research in EH-related programs in health sciences,
engineering, environmental sciences, and environmental justice and policy fields. Our program provides
mentoring and research expertise in EH fields by building on an existing, highly successful ROUTES program
model that has included (1) engagement and recruitment opportunities through URM undergraduate outreach
at NEU, (2) full-time co-op research experiences for six months for URM students, (3) targeted mentoring and
support services to assist URM student participants in pursing graduate studies and research careers, and
(4) professional development for URM students through engagement with larger research communities. In the
proposed renewal, by expanding ROUTES co-op experiences from the current full-time research experiences
in NEU research labs to include translational research opportunities in industry, government and non-profit
organizations, we will diversify the number and types of experiences available to students, and increase the
number of students impacted by the ROUTES program through leveraging of funds. ROUTES will build upon a
network of existing NEU programs that recruit and support URM students in STEM and other fields, including
existing P42 (center) and T32 (training) programs at NEU, for more robust pathway connections for students.
The program evaluation plan includes well-designed assessment and review that will provide continuous
improvement to maximize efficacy. Expected Results: ROUTES will enlarge the pool of undergraduate URM
students that are interested in exploring EH research careers and create opportunities for up to 50 students
over five years to participate in paid hands-on research experiences, mentoring, and complementary activities.
Through these methods, ROUTES will continue to encourage URMs to pursue research careers in EH, thus
addressing a critical national need."

 Title: The role and therapeutic potential of IGF2BP2 in MLL-rearranged leukemia.
 Background: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most abundant internal modification in
eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and plays roles in many normal bioprocesses. Evidence is emerging that
the aberration in m6A modification and the associated machinery also plays important roles in various types of
cancers. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common forms of hematopoietic malignancies with various
cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged (MLLr) AML is a common
and fatal subtype of AML, which accounts for 5%-10% of “de novo” AML cases and 10%-15% of therapy-related
leukemia (t-AML) cases. MLLr AML patients are associated with poor outcomes, with a 5-year overall survival
(OS) rate of ~30%. Therefore, there is a critical unmet medical need to develop improved therapeutics for
MLLr AML treatment. The leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs) are considered to be the root cause for the
treatment failure and relapse of AML. Collectively, it is critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
MLLr AML pathogenesis and LSC/LIC self-renewal, which may lead to the development of improved novel therapeutic
strategies to treat MLLr AML. Our preliminary data showed that IGF2BP2, which encodes an m6A reader, is specially
overexpressed in MLLr AML and its increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis in AML patients.
Our preliminary functional studies suggest that IGF2BP2 likely plays a critical oncogenic role as an m6A reader
in promoting MLLr AML pathogenesis. IGF2BP2 is also expressed at a significantly higher level in MLLr
LSCs/LICs compared to healthy hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and bulk MLLr AML cells, implying
a role of IGF2BP2 in MLLr LSC/LIC self-renewal. In addition, we have developed a potent inhibitor (namely
CWI1-2) that targets IGF2BP2 directly and exhibits high anti-leukemia efficacy as shown in our preliminary
studies.
 Hypothesis: IGF2BP2 plays an essential role in MLLr AML pathogenesis and LSC/LIC self-renewal, and
that pharmacological inhibition of IGF2BP2 can lead to effective treatment of MLLr AML.
 Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of IGF2BP2 in MLLr AML pathogenesis and LSC/LIC self-renewal; 2)
Decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the role of IGF2BP2 in MLLr AML; and 3) Assess the therapeutic
potential of pharmacologically targeting IGF2BP2 in treating MLLr AML.
 Potential Impact: Our proposed studies are of high novelty and high significance in both basic research and
translational medicine, which will substantially advance our understanding of the biology of MLLr leukemia, and
may also result in the development of effective novel therapeutics for the treatment of MLLr leukemia."
10794366,"Efferocytosis by bone marrow stromal cells and bone aging
Pre-clinical studies show that senescent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (a.k.a. stem) cells (MSCs)
and osteolineage cells contribute to age-dependent bone loss and bone marrow failure. Therefore, the
identification of novel mechanisms that accelerate MSC dysfunction could enable mechanistic approaches to
degenerative processes that impact the skeleton. While a handful of in vitro studies previously demonstrated
MSCs’ ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells (efferocytosis), matrix, pathogens and metal particles, whether
efferocytosis by MSCs impacts their function and bone maintenance is not known. We found that bone marrow
MSCs indeed efferocytose apoptotic neutrophils in vivo. Preliminary data from adult mice with transgenic
overexpression of the direct phosphatidyl serine receptor BAI1 in MSCs suggest that chronic low dose
enhancement of efferocytosis by MSCs may be beneficial to skeletal health. We also found that, in aged mice,
efferocytosis by MSCs is significantly increased. Moreover, transcriptional and functional preliminary data in vitro
suggest that excessive efferocytosis by MSCs decreases osteoblastic differentiation and promotes senescence.
Since efferocytosis is accompanied by oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes, which we previously found
to modulate osteoblastic differentiation, mitochondrial disruption may mediate functional changes in MSCs that
clear high numbers of apoptotic cells. Based on these data, we hypothesize that phagocytosis by MSCs is an
important component of osteoimmunology; however when pathologically increased in aging, it causes MSC
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence, thus contributing to bone loss. To test this, using
aging and genetic models, we will 1) determine the mechanism of MSC efferocytosis; 2) define the pathogenic
mechanisms induced by efferocytosis in MSCs; and 3) establish the role of efferocytosis by MSCs in normal
osteoimmunology and in aged bone. Defining the role of facultative phagocytosis/efferocytosis in metabolic
changes and senescence in MSC and their relevance to human aging and disease will provide innovative,
actionable strategies impacting degenerative disorders that target the skeleton."

T1D, the factors that govern the onset and duration of PRM are not fully understood. Initially it was believed
that PRM is solely a metabolic phenomenon, but there is increasing evidence that the immune system also
plays an active part. This leads to the primary hypothesis that underpins our proposal: identification of
immunological, metabolic, and demographic features that associate with PRM duration will enable
the development of improved clinically actionable composite biomarkers for T1D.
Our study has a single specific aim, namely, to define and validate one or more classifiers that can
accurately predict fast or slow progression of T1D in the first 2y post-onset from baseline data. This will be
achieved through an in depth multimodal analysis of peripheral blood drawn from a cohort of 100 subjects
with a recent diagnosis of T1D. A single draw will be made at 3-6 months post diagnosis, and a range of
assays performed with DNA, RNA, protein and functional readouts, and ranging in complexity from single
analytes to single cell transcriptomes. PRM duration will be determined from clinical data collected over the
following 1.5-2y. Subjects will be randomized to training and validation cohorts matched for age, gender,
and content of “fast” and “slow” progressors. Features from the analytical data will be used to generate
models that predict PRM duration using DIFAcTO, a machine learning algorithm that combines univariate
filtering, hierarchical clustering, and LASSO regression, to select non-redundant features that result in an
optimal model. Performance of the final models will be evaluated by applying them to the independent
validation cohort.
The features retained in the resulting models will be prime candidates as composite biomarkers to improve
subject stratification at recruitment, and aid identification of responders and non-responders, in future
clinical trials. Thus, if successful, our study should have significant impact on the field."
10794413,"The goal of this project is to define the molecular mechanisms governing neural tube closure. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are amongst the most common human structural congenital malformations. In this project, we focus on a highly expressed microRNA family in pluripotency, miR-302, which plays a critical role during neural tube closure. Using genetic loss-of-function mouse, chicken and human models, we find that miR-302 is required to prevent precocious differentiation of the neuroepithelium. Additionally, we present data suggesting that miR- 302 is mutated in humans with neural tube closure defects. This project will provide insight into the earliest stages of neural tube development and inform our understanding of how microRNAs control this critical process."
10792044,"This project is designed to evaluate the relationship between the intra-cellular thyroid hormone (TH) levels and
brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, transcriptome and cellular composition and correlate with circulating TH
levels and other metabolic parameters in adult humans, to better understand the interaction between the
thyroid axis and BAT in the process of thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Studies using positron emission
tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning have shown metabolically active BAT in adult humans,
whose activity correlated inversely with body fat. TH plays an important role in brown adipocyte differentiation
and controls adaptive thermogenesis in BAT by uncoupling the oxidative phosphorylation. Based on data from
animal studies and findings from our prior studies in adult humans, we hypothesize that intra-cellular T3, the
active form of TH stimulates BAT activity by directly affecting the transcriptome and cellular composition of
BAT.
We plan to study 10 hyperthyroid and 10 hypothyroid patients who require thyroid surgery as part of their standard
medical care. Perithyroidal BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) (control) will be collected during
the surgery. Thyroid function tests and metabolic parameters, including fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and lipid
panel will be measured at the time of the surgery. A study visit will be scheduled in the Clinical Research
Center (CRC) within a week prior to the thyroid surgery. The patients will undergo indirect calorimetry to measure
resting metabolic rate (RMR) and dual energy xray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure body composition. A PET-
CT scan will then be performed after wearing a cooling vest set at 55-61 °F for 2 hours to measure BAT volume
and activity. We will measure adipose tissue TH concentration using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC-MS). We will investigate the relationship between the intra-cellular and circulating thyroid hormone (TH)
levels and BAT activity, RMR, body composition as well as other metabolic parameters. We will also perform
block and single nucleus RNA-sequencing of the collected adipose tissue samples to understand the impact of
the thyroid axis on the transcriptome and cellular composition of human neck BAT and WAT.
The current project will help to further elucidate the complex relationship between the thyroid axis and BAT
function, transcriptome and cellular composition in the process of thermogenesis in humans. There are no prior
published human studies looking into the effect of intra-cellular TH levels on BAT activity. The study results will
be used to write a competitive NIH grant (R01) to experimentally test the connection between TH and BAT in
adult humans and find new treatment strategies for obesity and diabetes, which are major public health
concerns."
10792052,"Abstract
 Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) maintain the electrical cadence in cardiac muscle tissues by
selectively controlling the rapid inward passage of sodium. The NaV complex is comprised of a 260-kDa pore-
forming α-subunit (encoded primarily by NaV1.5 in heart) that partners with β -subunits (β1-β4) comprised of a
single transmembrane segment and exofacial immunoglobulin (Ig) fold. These β-subunits belong to a larger
family of β/MPZ proteins that includes other single pass Ig proteins such as MPZ(P0). Defects in sodium
channel function resulting from inherited mutations in either the α or β subunits are established causes of
human disease, and are associated with sudden infant death, atrial fibrillation, reperfusion and ischemia injury,
arrhythmia in the failing heart, epilepsy, and a variety of pain-causing syndromes. Other forms of heart disease
that develop later in life and that are exacerbated by obesity are also characterized by altered sodium channel
activity, in particular the inability to quickly and completely inactivate during the course of the cardiac action
potential.
 The β-subunits have been proposed to regulate essentially every aspect of the pore-forming α subunit;
including protein complex trafficking and turn-over, voltage-dependent function, and pharmacology. However,
the molecular bases for these wide-ranging effects are poorly resolved primarily because the ‘gold standard’
heterologous cells that are used for ion channel characterization and high-throughput screening exhibit near
ubiquitous expression of β-subunits, and their near relatives. As such, the variability amongst expression
systems has stymied systematic study of β-subunit function. This in turn has prevented translational studies to
examine the effect of various β subunit disease-associated mutants as well as efforts to identify drugs that may
specifically modify specific α/β NaV complexes. We recently generated a CRISPR-modified human haploid cell
line that lacks multiple members of the β/MPZ family including β1-β4. Electrophysiological experiments with
these cells have revealed new emergent properties of NaV1.5 in the absence and presence of β subunits.
These data provide the proof-of-concept that mammalian cells lacking the β/MPZ family will provide a powerful
and needed way to specifically study many aspects of particular NaV α/β complexes, allowing better
fundamental structure/function studies, better understanding of how disease-causing mutations in both α and β
subunits cause pathology, and more precise tools for drug screening and drug safety profile testing."
10792289,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The poor thermostability of vaccines is the most notable factor for their inequitable global distribution. The cold
chain system imposes a substantial barrier for equitable global access to safe and potent vaccines. To eliminate
or improve this vaccine coverage gap, minimizing the costly and labor-intensive cold chain process is a critical
need, which would potentially lead to a major reduction of vaccine wastage. We intend to develop tools for cost-
effective ambient temperature storage of vaccines without requiring refrigeration or complicated sample recovery
protocols for extended durations. This work will introduce the possibility of improving global vaccine access via
offering an innovative approach capable of reducing the costs of vaccine storage and deployment, thereby over-
coming vaccine shortage and equity issues.
 We aim to develop new natural deep eutectic solvents (NatDESs), highly polar and molecularly-tunable or-
ganic materials with generally recognized as safe (GRAS) toxicity profiles to improve the thermostability of two
important proven vaccine platforms: 1) yellow fever virus as a lipid enveloped, positive sense RNA virus; 2)
adenovirus as protein capsid, double stranded DNA virus. The proposed formulations will offer a well-suited
platform on which the properties can be readily altered by the selection of ions, enabling the tunable design of
media for the long-term stabilization of these vaccine platforms. We expect that the solutions of proposed
NatDESs with up to 20 wt% water will prevent hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation of viral genomes and protein
capsids, promoting high levels of protection for the viral models.
 In Aim 1, we will develop a diverse series of novel NatDESs through systematic variations of quaternary
ammonium cations, biocompatible anions, and bio-sourced sugars and polyols. To gain in-depth understanding
of binding characteristics and molecular mechanisms of interactions in viral samples, we will conduct empirical
structure-property-function relationship studies using a combination of simulation and X-ray crystallographic
methods. In Aim 2, we will examine their utility for stabilizing viral samples via evaluating their structural integrity,
thermostability, and shelf-life by monitoring changes in viral secondary structure, thermal denaturation, and par-
ticle morphology. This approach has great potential to resolve the cold chain problem and in turn positively
impact global health, coverage and equity, and economic cost, compared to the current technologies.
 This application will address the key objectives of the AREA (R15) grant mechanism through supporting
meritorious research, exposing undergraduate students to research, and strengthening the research environ-
ment of two primarily undergraduate institutions. These activities include instruction and the mentoring of women,
first-generation, and underrepresented minority students.

Our goal is to commercialize a new assay system that detects and quantifies receptor
downregulation/desensitization, and receptor resensitization, for large numbers of
human GPCRs in parallel. This miniaturized, multiplexed and scalable system enables
diverse GPCR discovery projects, and it dramatically lowers the cost-per-target in
primary and secondary drug screens, thereby relieving major bottlenecks in the
development of new therapeutic molecules. In phase 1 of the proposed project, we will
validate in array transfection and assay automation for 23 human lipid and nucleoside
receptors. In phase 2 the set will be extended to include the complete human
endogenous GPCR repertoire. The new system will: (1) enable chemical and biologic
libraries to be screened against the complete human GPCR repertoire in a highly
multiplexed format, (2) improve drug development by revealing selectivity patterns that
can be addressed to produce more precisely targeted, and more effective, therapeutic
molecules, (3) provide an efficient means to deorphanize human GPCRs of uncertain
function, of which more than 100 presently exist, and (4) provide a new and affordable

The molecular mechanisms underlying cellular vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease are unclear. The objective
of this project is to clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for select cell vulnerability and pathogenesis
by applying spatial methods for highly multiplexed RNA and protein analysis in Alzheimer’s-affected tissue
sections. We will optimize and standardize platforms for multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH)
to examine AD-linked gene sets derived from single nucleus transcriptome analysis, as well as
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine pathological protein markers in the context of cell type populations in
intact human brain tissue. These methods will then be applied to Alzheimer’s disease tissues from brain
regions affected in different levels of disease severity to understand 1) the spatial organization of
transcriptomically-defined cell types in these brain regions and changes in this organization with disease
severity (e.g. selective vulnerability or proliferation), 2) molecular pathways disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease in
the context of specific cell types, and 3) the relationship between these affected cell types and the markers of
Alzheimer’s pathology, such as amyloid precursor protein and hyperphosphorylated tau. These data generated
by mFISH and IHC together will provide a high-resolution map of the cellular and molecular consequences of
clinically typical Alzheimer’s disease and an enhanced view of Alzheimer’s pathology, as well as a powerful

SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, continues to cause widespread infection and morbidity, but death rates
have decreased as most of the world has either been infected or vaccinated or both. However, at the same time,
it has become clear that many patients have developed long term sequelae. These sequelae, called PASC (Post
Acute Sequelae of COVID-19), affect many organ systems even though virus is found at autopsy in nearly all
studies only in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. One common symptom of acute COVID-19 is anosmia.
Recovery of olfactory function is often incomplete in patients. However, only supporting (sustentacular) cells and
not olfactory sensory neurons are infected in patients, raising the question of how infection of a supporting cell
could have such profound effects on olfaction. In addition, neurological disease is also present in many patients
with PASC. Many of these manifestations reflect ongoing inflammation (usually observed on autopsy), but the
basis of these inflammatory changes is unclear since virus cannot be detected. We have isolated a mouse-
adapted virus that causes severe acute respiratory disease in infected mice, as well as persistent signs of
disease is the lungs and brains months after the acute infection has resolved. Infected mice develop anosmia,
as well as long term behavioral abnormalities and defects in neurotransmitter expression, but virus is not present
in the brain. Our central hypothesis is that ongoing inflammation is a major contributory factor in the observed
dysfunction in the olfactory and neurological systems. This hypothesis will be addressed in the following specific
aims: Specific Aim 1: To understand the relationship between sustentacular cell infection and olfactory
dysfunction and to understand the basis of chronic changes in the brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Acute
and chronic changes in olfactory pathways will be probed using electrophysiological and olfactory
measurements. These changes will be related to sustentacular function and gene expression. Parts of the brain,
such as the substantia nigra, which are affected in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease will
be studied. Our preliminary results show changes in neurotransmitter expression in the substantia nigra several
months after infection, supporting this hypothesis. Specific Aim 2: To examine the role of viral macromolecular
products and infiltrating inflammatory cells in the brains of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the development
of PASC. Using molecular and immunological approaches, we will assess whether inflammation results from
extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection and rapid clearance within the first days of infection (‘hit and run’). Using
a mouse in which infiltrating myeloid cells can be readily identified, we will analyze localization, function and
gene expression of these infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as of T cells that infect the brain chronically. The
ultimate goal is to relate these changes in inflammation to the neurological/olfactory dysfunction that we
characterize in Aim 1."

Minority-Serving Institutions in the nation that is also classified as “Doctoral Extensive-very high research activity”
by the Carnegie Classification. We propose to transform our current MD/PhD program into a robust LEAD
MSTP through a combination of strongly supportive new leadership in the UNM Health Sciences Center
(HSC), increased institutional financial support, and the proposed MSTP support. Our MD/PhD program
has been highly successful in terms of inclusion of underrepresented trainees, degree completion, time to
completion, successful matching in high quality residencies and fellowships, and attainment of academic careers.
While program growth was limited over the last 20 years, the UNM HSC has committed to increasing the total
program size to approximately 20 trainees within five years and 40 trainees within ten years. UNM HSC has
recently undergone transformational leadership and institutional changes and has committed to furthering health
equity through education, research, workforce, and healthcare delivery systems.
 The Program Mission is to provide outstanding training for the next generation of diverse clinician
scientists. Through the following objectives, the UNM LEAD MSTP will grow and enhance the translational
research ecosystem to improve satisfaction in training and persistence in clinician scientist careers. Objective 1:
Recruit students from underrepresented groups so that UNM LEAD MSTP trainees better reflect the
demographics of the region. Objective 2: Incorporate topics of developing innovation into the training programs.
Objective 3: Build on the existing MD/PhD program to provide rigorous clinical training with exceptional
predoctoral research training. Objective 4: Support and retain trainees throughout all stages of the program with
a goal of >90% of matriculants completing the program. Objective 5: Expand alumni engagement efforts to
expand the clinician scientist community at UNM and to support efficient transition to independent investigator
positions. Our specific goal is yearly engagement with >80% of graduates. Objective 6: Ensure robust
mechanisms for continuous program evaluation and improvement.
 This Multiple PI/PD proposal will build on strong predoctoral training in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate
Program to incorporate training opportunities in Health Equity Sciences, Bioengineering, and Computational
Sciences. We have developed a plan for sustainable program growth that requests three training slots in year 1,
four training slots in years 2-3, and five training slots in years 4-5. We will provide a student-centered,
integrated training experience that builds on past successes to develop exceptional, diverse clinician

10795066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Excessive drinking results in tremendous economic and social costs and is a leading cause of preventable
death in the US. Only a small minority of people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive appropriate
services, and there are large disparities in access to alcohol health services for people based on
race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and urbanicity. The proposed study will answer pressing
questions about how to reduce disparities in access, using simulation modeling to examine whether
universal increases in access to evidence-based practices (EBPs) such as screening, brief intervention, and
referral to treatment (SBIRT) or medication-assisted treatment can reduce disparities, or whether more
targeted efforts to improve access are needed to reach high-priority population subgroups. Simulation
models are well-suited for identifying unintended consequences of interventions implemented in complex
systems, as well as outcomes that may occur years after implementation. By projecting intervention effects
across population subgroups over time, simulation modeling can help identify and prioritize types of alcohol
health services interventions to reduce AUD disparities. Although simulation methods are being used to
address the opioid crisis, to date there is no published simulation model comprehensively describing the
continuum of alcohol health services in relation to AUD disparities. The proposed study fills this gap by
simulating effects of increased access to alcohol health services across the continuum of care from SBIRT,
to specialty care (including AUD medications) and informal treatment (including 12-step groups like
Alcoholics Anonymous), in relation to health disparities. First, we will build and calibrate a microsimulation
model of alcohol health services for people with mild, moderate, and severe AUD, guided by a conceptual
model that includes barriers to treatment at the individual, organizational, community, and policy levels. Next,
we will use a geographically situated simulated population representing the large, demographically and
geographically diverse states of California and Texas to make long-term projections for AUD severity and
recovery for key population subgroups over time. Finally, informed by theories of healthcare access and
utilization, we will project changes in AUD treatment disparities under several enhanced conditions to identify
the mix and distribution of services that would best reduce disparities, and we estimate costs and benefits of
improved service access. Study Aims are to assess effects of (1) universal implementation of EBPs in
traditional and non-traditional settings and (2) improving accessibility, availability, affordability, and
acceptability of alcohol health services on disparities, and to (3) estimate cost and cost-effectiveness of
these changes. Results will provide detailed information to inform service planning by states, counties, and
communities to improve health services, including projections for how and where to intervene in a cost-
effective manner to reduce the burden of AUD and increase long-term recovery for vulnerable populations."

In this project, we propose to establish a two-year MSc in Global Health Ethics degree at the
University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences (UCT FHS), as well as to formalize the
research ethics training curriculum at that Faculty. Through a focus on decolonization of ethics
scholarship and from the perspective of the African humanities, we propose to revolutionise ethics
teaching in African health research by foregrounding African experiences, needs and worldviews
to equip our students to interrogate health research ethics drawing on the latest thinking in the
African humanities anchored into the need to decolonise global health and global health ethics.
Through the programme we sensitise our students the historical, social and political factors that
influence the shape and organisation of global health research, and the manifestation of particular
ethical challenges in it. We will combine foundational courses in African humanities with advanced
courses in six domains of frontier scientific research taking place in Africa – namely AI,
Neuroscience, Genomics, Humanitarian Research, Research in Children, and Open Science. The
aim is to graduate students that are able to critically engage with these frontier scientific
developments in a way that reflects the ontologies, experiences and needs of Africans. Over the
course of this program, we will graduate at least 15 MSc students, 6 of whom will be fully funded
and 9 of whom will be partly funded by program resources. We will also make available some of
our course content as short courses. Over the course of the program, we will offer 16 short
research ethics courses to a minimum of 320 individuals.
We will also conduct a meticulous assessment of current ad hoc ethics training initiatives in the
UCT FHS, analyze support needs and monitor the quality of ongoing efforts. Drawing on the
results of this assessment, we will design and implement a formalized curriculum for research
ethics training in the FHS which will include extensive mentorship for those currently offering
ethics training across the FHS departments and divisions. Finally we will work to increase the
visibility of ethics in the FHS and show UCT FHS staff and students that ethics is exciting and
relevant to the plethora of medical research ongoing in the FHS. We will do so by organizing
regular events in the FHS that speak to a topic in research ethics, ranging from regular discussion
forums drawing on popular forms of media (such as podcasts, videos or newspaper articles) to
introduce people to pertinent topics in ethics, to more formal monthly presentations, ‘ask anything’
ethics quickfix events and special events with diverse guest speakers from anywhere in the world.
Participation in this enrichment program will be mandatory for our MSc trainees."

 Almost 3 billion people worldwide, including 89% people in Bangladesh, are exposed to harmful
household air pollutants (HAP) emitted from combustion of biomass (wood, agricultural residue, cow dung,
etc.) fuel use for cooking. While health risks associated with air-pollution have been reasonably well-studied in
developed countries, there is little evidence on health benefits achievable by HAP reduction through clean fuel
use, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Bangladesh GEOHealth hub has established a
cohort of biomass fuel users (n=660). We observed that an increased HAP exposure was associated with lung
function decline, increased blood pressure and disruption of innate and adaptive immune function. We
observed a drastic reduction in HAP exposure by exclusive liquified petroleum gas (LPG) stove use for 24
months, resulting changes in immune and inflammatory responses in women and in children. However,
changes in chronic cardio-pulmonary markers were challenging mostly due to short duration of follow up. In
quest for an innovative cost effective, adaptable, and scalable intervention as the possible next step, we
planned to conduct a large household level randomized controlled trial by educational intervention using mobile
phone (mHealth) based technology. In addition, we will continue following the cohort and will conduct rigorous
and repeated personalized (24-48 hours) and area (over 5 days) assessments of PM2.5 and black carbon (BC)
exposure to examine the long-term effects of HAP reduction on subclinical measures of cardio-pulmonary and
immune dysfunction including effect of HAP exposure on antibody response to vaccine. We will also use deep
learning methods to identify lung pathology in relation to HAP. Finally, we propose two exploratory studies on
health effects of industrial waste and garment industry work. The aims of this study are scientifically important
and directly policy-relevant and consistent with the GEOHealth program agenda.

10794940,"Toward our long-term goal of delivering precision medicine in the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE), we plan to develop a methodological framework to classify HIE based on brain MRI
evaluation combined with clinical variables to better predict neurological prognosis. In this proposal, we will
create an MRI quantification tool to identify various types of lesions, which, combined with clinical variables,
will isolate HIE subtypes and subsequent clinical phenotypes to predict prognosis. HIE is the most common
cause of acquired brain injury in the neonatal period. It can result in a wide range of neurological complications
that affect various functional domains, with heterogeneous severity. Stratification of HIE subtypes and specific
prognoses is essential for developing and delivering targeted adjuvant and rehabilitative treatments and is also
necessary for medical providers in order to guide the appropriate allocation of resources. Although predictive
biomarkers have been highly anticipated, as of yet, there are none validated. MRI has demonstrated strong
predictive power for severe neurobehavioral deficits within the context of severe MRI findings. However,
predicting outcomes following moderate-to-mild changes or even a normal-looking brain MRI does not
guarantee normal neurobehavioral outcomes. With the recent advances in image analysis technologies, we
intend to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value by detecting and quantifying moderate-to-mild
pathological changes, which are difficult to evaluate qualitatively. Since individualized prediction cannot be
made from a single feature, as each feature weakly correlates with outcomes, we hypothesize that patient
stratification, combining brain MRI features and clinical characteristics, will be highly accurate for individualized
prediction. We will apply our automated structure-by-structure image quantification (SIQ) pipeline, developed
and validated through R01HD065955, to be applied for the MRI quantification in this proposal. The HIE cohort
study (R01HD086058) will provide a library of teaching files that consist of MRIs with various types of lesions,
from which the SIQ algorithm learns the features of the lesions. The cohort also includes clinical variables,
such as serum markers and electroencephalograms, combined with the MRI features and test data for the
validation study. For Aim 1, we will create a reference library that includes MRI atlases with various
pathological changes due to HIE. Combined with the multi-atlas label fusion and lesion localization algorithms,
the library enables a robust SIQ. For Aim 2, we will apply a supervised learning algorithm to the MRI features
quantified by the SIQ to identify brain lesions and the severity that is associated with certain outcomes. Aim 3
will use a supervised classification algorithm for the MRI features and clinical variables to determine the HIE
subtypes related to the affected functional domains and the severity of the outcomes. This project will provide a
methodological framework with which to identify subgroups of infants with HIE who are at risk of developing
neurological complications, and who may benefit from current and future early interventions."
10795025,"Alcohol-related diseases and disorders (ADD) account for over 5% of global health problems, and alcohol
abuse is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases. Endotoxemia and systemic inflammation are common
conditions associated with morbidity and mortality in various ADD. Extensive clinical and experimental
evidence indicates that disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junction and mucosal barrier dysfunction are
prerequisite steps in alcoholic endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and ADD. A critical barrier in the field is
that the mechanisms of alcohol-induced tight junction disruption are poorly defined. Hence, the current
treatment for ADD remains empiric (e.g., corticosteroids). Our long-term goal is to describe the
pathophysiology of ADD and develop novel therapeutic strategies by targeting gut barrier dysfunction. TRPV6
and CaV1.3 are Ca2+ permeable ion channels on the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium. Our
preliminary studies have identified that: 1) Calcium influx from the apical membrane is required for the
synergistic disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junction and barrier dysfunction by alcohol. 2) TRPV6 or
CaV1.3 deficiency attenuates alcohol-induced epithelial permeability. 3) TRPV6 is required for alcohol-induced
elevation of intracellular calcium, 4) Alcohol evokes ionic currents in Caco-2 cells sensitive to SOR-C13, a
TRPV6 inhibitor. 5) TRPV6 or CaV1.3 deficient mice are resistant to alcohol-induced gut permeability. 6) SOR-
C13 prevents the alcohol-mediated epithelial permeability. These findings form the scientific premise and
support the central hypothesis that TRPV6 and CaV1.3 channels drive alcohol-induced endotoxemia and
systemic inflammation by enforcing intestinal epithelial TJ disruption and mucosal barrier dysfunction. We will
test this hypothesis by determining that 1) the coordinated activities of TRPV6 and CaV1.3 channels mediate
alcohol-induced rise in cellular calcium in the intestine, 2) TRPV6 and CaV1.3 channels mediate alcohol-
induced gut permeability, endotoxemia, and systemic inflammation, and 3) evaluate the preventive and
mitigating potential of SOR-C13 and diltiazem, the calcium channel blockers, in alcohol-induced endotoxemia
and systemic response. The expected outcome of these studies will be a deeper understanding of the
intestine’s role in the pathophysiology of ADD and the identification of rationally designed novel therapeutic
targets for the prevention and treatment of ADD."

major contributor to group trials with additional contribution of our Care Centers; 2) facilitate and
encourage YCC faculty to assume leadership roles in SWOG and other NCTN groups by
supporting their time and effort and rewarding these activities; and 3) leverage our NCTN
Coordinating Committee (NCC) as a bridge to bring Yale translational science to group
activities as the results of our investigator initiated pilot trials become promising for multi-center
and randomized questions. In addition to the leadership efforts of Dr. Fuchs, other key SWOG
leaders include Drs. Roy Herbst, Daniel Petrylak and Lajos Pusztai. Drs. Peter Glazer, Roy
Decker and Alessandro Santin will lead our efforts in the NRG group in addition to Dr. Barbara

the greater patient population across the state of Connecticut. This UG1 grant will assist us in
developing the appropriate leadership and infrastructure for support of key NCTN group efforts
in both accrual and program development."

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of mortality and economic burden in the United States. Of
the patterns of excessive intake, binge drinking is the most common and accounts for approximately half of the
deaths attributable to alcohol. In addition to high rates of mortality, repeated cycles of binge alcohol intake and
withdrawal cause persistent adaptations in brain regions that increase the risk of psychiatric symptoms and
subsequent excessive alcohol consumption. This places individuals at greater risk for developing alcohol
dependence. These outcomes may be driven by dysregulation in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)
systems originating in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Although involvement of 5-HT has been well established
in alcohol use disorder, we lack a thorough understanding of the neural circuits and precise signaling
mechanisms that underlie this dysregulation. In this proposal, I will examine the adaptations in a 5-HT circuit
from the DR to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that result from repeated episodes of binge-like alcohol intake. I
will accomplish this using a series of converging and highly innovative ex vivo and in vivo techniques that will
allow me to measure binge alcohol-induced changes in 5-HT release and signaling dynamics in the DR and
the OFC. Further, I will probe the causal role of 5-HT signaling in the DR-OFC circuit in promoting excessive
alcohol intake. In addition to providing me with advanced technical training and professional development
activities, this proposal will provide essential information concerning the actions of binge-like alcohol drinking
on 5-HT neural circuitry and signaling. Ultimately, this proposal will identify a circuit-based signaling
mechanism that can be used for the targeted treatment of alcohol use disorder.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently engage in severe destructive behavior that presents
significant risks to themselves and others, poses substantial barriers to community integration, and results in
high familial and societal financial impact. Despite the efficacy of behavior analytic (BA) interventions for
decreasing destructive behavior, to produce meaningful outcomes in the natural environment, treatment effects
must transfer to natural change agents, such as parents. Parents are often provided with brief in-person
training with therapists modeling and practicing procedures and relapse is common. Although parent training
on BA interventions for destructive behavior leads to parent skill acquisition, parents experience in-person
training barriers, such as time, financial burden, transportation, and childcare, as well as concerns with the
quality of training delivered, such as unrealistic training with therapists and a lack of comfort with therapist
practice. To address these barriers, we propose to refine and test a novel virtual reality (VR) parent training
tool that allows parents to practice intervention implementation in the comfort of their own home at times
convenient for their schedule and quality barriers by closely resembling scenarios parents encounter with their
own child. Specific aims of this project are to 1) To pilot a fully customizable, in-home VR training tool for
caregivers to learn and practice behavioral strategies for managing their child’s challenging behavior, and 2)
To assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a VR training tool using a randomized pilot
trial with caregivers and clinicians. In this proof-of-concept study, we will determine skills acquired, treatment
fidelity, training adherence, generalization of skills, usability, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the VR-
based training compared to a standard of care control group who receives in-person training with a therapist.
The program will be customized to match the specific child, specific target behaviors, context in which the
behavior occurs, and specific treatment components. Parents will be exposed to a treatment challenge to
prepare for the durability of children’s destructive behavior. The proposed VR tool is individualized, realistic,
flexible, safe, and has the potential to transform caregiver training programs for ASD, improve outcomes for
children with ASD, and increase caregiver confidence, satisfaction, and well-being."

The IL-1 subfamily members IL-1α and IL-1β both signal through the IL-1R1 receptor. The activation and function
of IL-1β has been described extensively in the context of inflammasome activation, which culminates in active
caspase-1 cleaving inactive pro-IL-1β to its active and secreted form. While pro-IL-1α can also be cleaved and
secreted by inflammasome activation, in contrast to IL-1β, pro-IL-1α is biologically active and is constitutively
expressed in epithelial cells. IL-1α exhibits dual functionality, acting as a traditional cytokine but also controlling
a number of diverse cellular functions. As discussed in this proposal, we have identified novel and physiologically
relevant functions of IL-1α in the context of innate immunity and inflammation, however the mechanisms by
which they are regulated is unclear. These novel findings reveal a number of fundamental knowledge gaps in
our understanding of IL-1α biology. In particular, the pathways by which IL-1α is released from dying cells are
largely unknown as is its ability to regulate inflammatory and cell death pathways. We will utilize crystalline silica
as a sterile inflammatory insult to interrogate these mechanistic questions. We have found that IL-1α in non-
hematopoietic cells plays a role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung in response to a sterile inflammatory
insult. Further, we show in vitro that IL-1α can bind specifically to the phospholipids cardiolipin and
phosphatidylserine. In epithelial cells, IL-1α co-localizes with phosphatidylserine and IL-1α is externalized
coincident with the movement of phosphatidylserine to the outer surface of the cell during apoptosis.
Phosphatidylserine exposure is an established “eat me” signal that identifies apoptotic cells for clearance by
macrophages through efferocytosis. We have found the presence of IL-1α on the surface of the cell blocks
efferocytosis, and propose this failure results in secondary necrosis of the epithelial cells, release of DAMPs,
and a physiologically relevant enhancement of inflammatory responses. Finally, we show the binding of IL-1α to
cardiolipin, once externalized on the mitochondrion by mitochondrial dysfunction, blocks the removal of damaged
mitochondria by mitophagy. We propose IL-1α binding to cardiolipin blocks its recognition by LC3b, a critical step
in mitophagy, thus preventing removal of damaged mitochondria. It is known that activation of the Nlrp3
inflammasome is triggered by mitochondrial damage and that downregulation of mitophagy results in enhanced
Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. We further propose that intracellular pro-IL-1α enhances Nlrp3 activation by
blockade of mitophagy. The completion of these studies will provide important insights into the regulation of the
innate immune response by the multiple cellular functions of IL-1α."
10836047,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already,
researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment
opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited
neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be
discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are
difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many
disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants,
spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within
high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced
deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease-
associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient
derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the
disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments.
At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential
therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule
libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an
expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological
perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical,
molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment
offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize
my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and
other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent
research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a
standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a
number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to
enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease
genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the
proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research
program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine."
10802352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This application describes our research into essential molecular pathways of the human pathogen,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), including studies of transcription regulation and DNA repair. Infection with
Mtb results in over 10 million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.5 million deaths annually, making it the deadliest
infection in the world. In addition, this health crisis continues to be exacerbated by the emergence of drug-
resistant strains, which demands the discovery of new antibiotic agents. In addition, we are deepening and
broadening our biophysical work elucidating mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription initiation via both ensemble
and single-molecule experiments coupled with kinetic modeling of the process in both yeast and humans.
 Transcription is responsible for changes in gene expression patterns during development or in adaptation to
environmental conditions. The recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to particular genes at particular times is
performed by sets of general and gene-specific transcription factors during transcription initiation. We are
studying the essential, operator-independent, global transcription factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CarD
and RbpA. These factors act by modulating the rates of isomerization into and out of the open complex
intermediate in initiation and, contrary to intuition, appear able to act as either activators or repressors without
recognizing DNA sequence directly. We will answer critical questions in the field regarding the sequence- and
sigma-factor (i.e., stress-response) dependence of these factors as well as their roles in post-initiation phases
of transcription.
 We are also studying links between the transcription and DNA repair in Mtb. Mycobacteria lack classically
conserved mismatch repair pathways (MMR) and possess repair factors not seen in E. coli. In addition, we have
recently uncovered a novel oxidative switch that activates the Mtb nucleotide excision repair enzyme (NER),
UvrD1. We are currently investigating the biophysical nature of this switch, alternative activation pathways, and
the ability of UvrD1 to interact with RNAP during transcription-coupled NER. Of particular interest, and providing
a link between our studies, is the shared RNAP-binding site used by both CarD and UvrD1.
 Lastly, we are continuing our investigations of the kinetic intermediates underlying pre-initiation-complex
(PIC) dependent transcription initiation. Specifically, we are determining the mechanism of DNA bubble
expansion during initial transcription in both yeast and humans. Our single-molecule magnetic-tweezers
experiments will provide high-resolution views of the mechanism of PIC function. We are also following up on
our recent discoveries of differences between the activities of yeast and human TFIIH (the general transcription
factor required for promoter unwinding) that may underly the distinct usage of transcription-start sites in these
organisms. As PIC function underlies gene expression, our unique approaches will provide important advances
in the study of human biology."

Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia characterized by progressive cognitive
decline. By estimates, Alzheimer's disease affects more than one-third of the population over 85,
posing a substantial socioeconomic burden. There is an apparent lack of understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and reported problems with animal models. These
obstacles prevent the development of new therapeutic strategies, especially their translation to
human patients. This proposal is based on molecular and cellular evidence and an analysis of
human Alzheimer's disease cases. It bridges several aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathology:
discovery of unique oxidative stress pathway, new aspects of microglial biology and dysfunction,
and basic mechanisms of cell adhesion/phagocytosis in the context of disease. We will answer
how exactly oxidation causes microglial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and how to
prevent/inhibit their detrimental consequences. Based on our pioneering preliminary studies, we
propose that oxidative stress targets important proteins in microglia responsible for phagocytosis,
leading to deficient phagocytosis and microglia overactivation in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore,
we will focus on the mechanisms of this damage and its prevention in Alzheimer's disease and
other neurodegenerative pathologies. We will develop a new intervention approach (compounds
neutralizing oxidative stress) and uncover new specific targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease."
10805044,"Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a debilitating condition of articular joints that is associated with pain, loss
of activity, and reduced quality of life. Non-battle musculoskeletal injuries in active Military members are higher
than civilian counterparts. Due in part to this increased risk of traumatic injury, and the occupational demands of
high-impact repetitive joint use, osteoarthritis incidence is almost three times higher in the military vs civilian
population by the age of 40. Current options (platelet-rich plasma, hyaluronic acid) for joint preservation are
being gradually replaced by autologous cell-based injections, including bone marrow aspirate concentrate
(BMAC), that aim to reduce intra-articular inflammation and relieve pain. Limitations for autologous sources of
BMAC expose these therapies to donor variation in product and efficacy. Age and PTOA can alter the cellular
composition and function of bone marrow, though how these changes may affect efficacy of BMAC injections for
PTOA pain relief remains unknown.
In this proposed project, we seek to devise a strategy to facilitate pain relief and joint preservation with BMAC
injections in a preclinical model of PTOA. Our central hypothesis posits that donor age, sex, and PTOA status
impact BMAC efficacy in relieving osteoarthritic pain and that personalized regimens of endurance exercise
could prime bone marrow to become a potent immunomodulatory product. We will address this objective with
two specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of patient factors (age, sex, PTOA) and exercise on BMAC composition
and immune-modulatory potential; 2) Evaluate the potential of individualized pre-habilitation to increase the pain-
relieving and joint-preserving capabilities of BMAC.
In the first aim, we will harvest and evaluate BMAC from 3 mo and 12 mo male and female Lewis rat populations
with and without induced PTOA. We will exercise a subset of rats daily. We will characterize the cellular
composition and immune-modulatory capabilities of the BMAC from all donors. We will then directly compare
BMAC quality from young vs. middle-aged, and osteoarthritic rats and evaluate whether exercise can rejuvenate
BMAC immune-modulatory potential. In the second aim, we will test the efficacy of these BMAC products in vivo
using a preclinical model of PTOA. We will assess longitudinal pain and function, as well as end-stage
inflammation and tissue health. We will then link the compositional and functional changes of BMAC due to age,
sex, PTOA, and exercise to in vivo pain relief. Findings from the successful completion of these aims will be well
positioned for expedited clinical translation to establish guidelines for quality control of BMAC and to encourage
clinicians to implement pre-habilitative interventions."
10795892,"Functional interplay between Hippo and estrogen receptor ESR1
Project Summary/Abstract
 The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER positive and growth of ER+
cancer is dependent on ER function. Hormone therapy by inhibiting ER is most commonly used
for ER+ breast cancer treatment, however, drug resistance develops. There is strong medical
need to develop new therapy, particularly for hormone therapy resistant breast cancer. Estrogen
receptor 1 (ESR1) encodes the major form of ER and has been extensively studied for its function
as a nuclear transcription factor. However, the transcriptional regulation of ESR1 itself is less
understood. Preliminary studies from our laboratory have shown that ESR1 expression is tightly
controlled by the Hippo pathway, which is known for its role in organ size control and
tumorigenesis. Deletion of LATS1/2 kinases, core components of the Hippo pathway, abolishes
ESR1 expression and inhibits growth of ER+ breast cancer cells. We further discovered that
LATS1/2 suppress cancer cell immunogenicity. This proposal is based on our novel and exciting
observations. A major goal of this project is to reveal the molecular mechanism of ESR1
transcription regulation by the Hippo pathway and the functional significance of ESR1 in mediating
Hippo biology in breast tissue. Furthermore, we posit that LATS inhibition has two effects on ER+
breast cancer: suppression of cell growth by reducing ESR1 expression; and enhancing the
efficacy of immunotherapy by increasing cancer cell immunogenicity. The second major goal is
to provide scientific basis for targeting the LATS1/2 kinases as a novel therapy for ER+ breast
cancer."
10795480,"This is an application for the Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) for Undergraduate-Focused
Institutions to carry out a toxicological study to gain insights about the biological basis by which particle pollution
can alter brain function during adolescence and its potential impact in mental health disorders. Ambient
particulate matter (PM) is the leading environmental health risk factor and largest driver of air pollution’s burden
of disease worldwide. Epidemiological studies have found associations between exposure to particle pollution
and adverse neurocognitive outcomes. However, there is a gap in knowledge about the windows of vulnerability
and mechanisms by which PM negatively impact the central nervous system (CNS) and its clinical implications.
To this extent, the overall goal of this application is to evaluate the neurocognitive effects of particle pollution
throughout adolescence. During this life stage, key processes in postnatal brain development of regions such as
the prefrontal cortex might render adolescents susceptible to environmental insults. About 50% of mental health
disorders have an onset during adolescence, many of which persist throughout the lifespan with long-lasting
impact in the well- being of individuals and their families. Our preliminary studies suggest that the prefrontal
cortex is a target for particle pollution. Structural and functional alterations in the prefrontal cortex underlie many
mental health disorders. Since neuroinflammation is the most prominent effect observed in animal models
exposed to particle pollution, we hypothesize that PM exposure will impair prefrontal cortex function by inducing
inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. To address this hypothesis, we will 1) Assess prefrontal
cortex function throughout adolescence in mice exposed to diesel exhaust particles and 2) Characterize the
spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular and molecular pro-inflammatory mediators in the prefrontal cortex of juvenile
mice exposed to different concentrations of diesel exhaust particles. The approach is innovative as it represents
a departure from current research by shifting focus on adolescence as a window of susceptibility for the adverse
health effects of particle pollution; and the prefrontal cortex as a target for PM-induced neurotoxicity. In addition,
as part of the AREA grant, we will engage low-income Hispanic students in all aspect of the proposed research.
To this extent, the proposed study will contribute knowledge about the environmental risk factors and biological
mechanisms impacting mental health disorders with onset during adolescence; and will expose
underrepresented undergraduate students to biomedical and environmental health research."
10795486,"Abstract: This project aims to establish distributed federated learning (FL) approaches for training robust,
clinically deployable machine learning (ML) models for, i) multi-class classification of DR, and ii) prediction of
proliferative DR (PDR) progression, in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA). DR is one of
the leading causes of severe vision loss. Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of
treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible vision loss from DR. Quantitative OCTA analysis and
OCTA-ML models have recently been applied to diagnose, classify, and understand the progression trends of
DR. Despite promising results, the clinical utility of OCTA based diagnostic algorithms is not yet fully determined,
due to small OCTA data-cohorts in clinical institutions, and the lack of wide-spread validation. More specifically,
a major limitation of OCTA-ML models is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets from a diverse sub-
population for robust performance. Moreover, efforts towards large, centralized datasets for ML research are
hindered by significant barriers to data sharing and privacy concerns. In this project, we aim to establish novel
federated ML approaches, where the model training is distributed across institutions instead of sharing patient
data and only the model parameters are shared with a central server. This enables gaining insights
collaboratively, e.g., in the form of a consensus model, without moving patient data beyond the firewalls of the
institutions. Three data cohorts from the Stanford University, University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), and National
Taiwan University (NTU) will be used to test the hypothesis that the accuracy of the OCTA-ML models using
federated approach is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets. Our first aim is to establish
an FL framework with adaptive domain alignment and enhanced data representation learning capability. Key
success criterion of aim 1 is to successfully integrate the pilot institutions into the FL framework for distributed
training of DR models for multi-class DR classification backed by comprehensive OCTA (textural, geometric, and
differential artery-vein (AV)) features. The second aim is to validate the FL-trained OCTA-ML and differential AV
complexity features for PDR progression on new longitudinal data from UIC and NTU. Key success criterion of
aim 2 is to validate OCTA-ML model performance and identify AV features that provide sensitive biomarkers to
predict PDR in patients with DR. As an alternative approach, we propose a vision transformer deep learning
model for PDR prediction. The attention mechanism of a transformer model can identify features of DR that can
provide new information and specific onsets of PDR progressions. Further investigation of the relationship
between the new features learned through the transformer model and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize
the design for better DR diagnosis/prognosis. Success of this project will establish distributed ML model training
approaches and pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective
prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes."
10910126,"ABSTRACT – BSL-3 Practices Core (Core 2)
The central mission of the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory Network is to provide a location and an
environment in which groundbreaking research on potentially dangerous pathogens can be performed safely.
As anyone with the responsibility of managing a leading BSL-3/ABSL-3 facility such as the Duke RBL will
attest, it is critical to imbue a culture of safety in which all individuals seek continuous improvement and
refinement of best practices. This culture of constant improvement must be sustained through the inevitable
turnover of staff that occurs in any long-standing facility, and while it is difficult to codify, we pride ourselves on
providing a cordial and supportive environment in which ideas for improvement by all members of the team are
welcomed. Viewed through this lens, the practices and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that define the
Duke RBL are continuously being refined and improved. Since the opening of the facility in 2007, the Duke
RBL has led the field with a world class safety team dedicated to providing safe, secure, and compliant
research through managing SOPs, conducting a rigorous training program, and assessments of performance.
Support from this grant will allow for the further enhancement of these programs through warm-readiness and
additional dedicated safety staff. Specific aims for this proposal are to 1) establish and maintain procedures for
safe and compliant research at BSL-3/ABSL-3; 2) provide biosafety theory education with hands-on instruction
for all personnel entering BSL-3/ABSL-3 for work with Select Agents; and 3) ensure continuous compliance
with established procedures by conducting routing biosafety/security audits and drills. The ability to maintain
and expand these robust safety programs to account for novel pathogens is critical for investigators to
adequately prepare for the next pandemic."
10786885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains an incurable disease. Despite the availability of vaccines and
potent anti-viral drugs, nearly 300 million people worldwide are infected with HBV. The challenge with
curing HBV is the persistence of the virus’ genome in the form of a double-stranded covalently closed
circular DNA, or cccDNA, in the liver cells of patients. Unfortunately, the most modern nucleoside analogs
(NUC) drugs do not eliminate cccDNA and infection is never fully cleared. To ultimately achieve a cure for
HBV, a new class of drugs are needed that can specifically induce degradation or loss of the cccDNA.
 This project will address the need for cccDNA targeting drugs by proposing to develop peptide nucleic
acids, or PNAs, as a therapeutic. PNAs are similar to small nucleic acid therapeutics that have already
been FDA approved, like Patisiran or Nusinersen. However, unlike other small nucleic acid drugs, PNAs
have the unique ability to directly bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and induce damage or
degradation. And unlike some biologics are being developed that can also bind and degrade dsDNA, like
CRISPR-Cas systems or TALENs, PNAs are extremely stable, exhibit low toxicity, are highly sequence
specific, and are deliverable without formulation of as nanoparticle formulations. PNAs can also build on
the successful development of FDA-aproved liver-targeted nucleic acid therapeutics like Patisiran.
 This project will first establish sensitive cccDNA detection and characterization methods to track
changes in cccDNA during the course of experimental treatments with PNAs. It will design, synthesize
and test a small library of PNAs that can target and potentially induce the degradation of cccDNA. These
will include two PNA binding modes to the cccDNA and DNA-modifying chemical conjugates, including
DNA alkylation and phosphodiester bond cleavage. These PNAs will be characterized in vitro and in cell
culture models of HBV. The best PNA designs will then be tested in mouse models using two modes of
delivery, direct injection or lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation, and their acute toxicity, immunogenicity,
and tissue distribution characterized. Finally, the best PNAs will further characterized for their dosing,
duration of effect, and ability to eliminate cccDNA in two mouse models of HBV. Together, these results
will evaluate the potential of PNAs to serve as a drug candidate for clearing cccDNA from infected animal
models of HBV. If successful, one or more lead PNAs could be identified for immediate preclinical
development to cure HBV, either alone or combined with currently prescribed NUCs or other antivirals."
10789750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. Although retinoblastoma
is an aggressive cancer, early diagnosis and treatment may prevent visual impairment, and even improve
mortality rates. This is particularly relevant for children at risk for retinoblastoma due to family history of the
disease, which can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. These children benefit fromea rly and frequent
screening evaluations. Currently, RB diagnosis and management remains largely dependent upon
ophthalmoscopic evaluation by expert clinicians. Ophthalmoscopy offers panretinal imaging, but suffers from a
poor sensitivity to sub-millimeter (subclinical) tumors and a limited ability to monitor treatment response.
Handheld optical coherence tomography (HH-OCT) offers the promise to address both of these needs, but
technical deficiencies in imaging speed and axial range severely limit is clinica l utility. Recent innovations in
circular-ranging methods, stretched-pulse mode-locked frequency comb lasers, and ultrawide handheld
microscopes open new avenues for clinically meaningful deployments of HH-OCT in the management of Rb. In
Aim 1, we will integrate these innovative technologies into a prototype instrument providing panretinal high-
resolution three-dimensional imaging. In Aim 2, we will perform pilot imaging studies in sedated children
undergoing RB screening. Study data will be used to assess the feasibility of panretinal imaging by HH-OCT in
sedated children, to quantify RPE and ILM visibility as an image quality metric predictive of the instrument’s
ability to detect subclinical tumors, and to confirm that the volume of all imaged tumors, regardless of size, can
be calculated."
10790247,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our environment is replete with agents, such as high energy radiation, air pollutants, industrial chemicals,
pesticides, and heavy metals that can damage DNA and thus compromise genome stability. Among myriad
environmentally-induced DNA lesions, the DNA double-strand break (DSB) is possibly the most deleterious
because of its potential to induce chromosomal rearrangements and collapse of DNA replication forks.
Homologous Recombination (HR) is a conserved mechanism that eliminates DSBs in an error-free fashion, and
defects in HR are very mutagenic, and associated with premature aging, neurological disorders, and cancer. As
in other complex biological processes, HR is subject to regulatory controls being dependent on protein
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. Of all known phosphorylation-dephosphorylation circuitries within the DNA
damage response (DDR), the kinases and phosphatases that act on tyrosine residues in target proteins remain
the most poorly defined. Importantly, we have found that the dual activity phosphatase EYA4 can
dephosphorylate physiologically relevant tyrosine residues on the DDR factors H2AX and RAD51. Accordingly,
depleting EYA4 sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation and genotoxic chemicals, and it also leads to severe
destabilization of the genome, causing chromosomal breakage and high levels of aneuploidy. Unexpectedly, our
biochemical analysis of highly purified EYA4 has shown that its protein phosphatase activity is dependent on
DNA addition and that EYA4 has intrinsic DNA binding activity. Moving forward, we will use a combination of
biochemistry, cell biology, and NMR to understand how the DNA binding activity of EYA4 contributes to its role
in DNA damage repair and genome protection, at DSBs and also DNA replication forks. Through these studies,
we will gain insight into a hitherto unknown circuitry of DDR protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation that has
a major impact on the cellular response to environmental exposures."
10790310,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (Hawli et al., 2009),
associated with significant developmental delays (Carr, 1988) and a disproportionate deficit in hippocampally-
dependent memory (Godfrey & Lee, 2018; Pennington et al., 2003). Due to this memory impairment, individuals
with Down syndrome may have a difficulty remembering specific details from past events, a pattern known as
overgeneral autobiographical memory. This overgeneral memory makes it difficult for individuals with Down
syndrome to share their past, can interfere with attempts to becoming more independent (Holland et al., 2016;
Sheldon et al., 2011), and leads to increases in anxiety and depression (Waters 2014; King et al., 2019; Latorre
et al., 2013).
 Although widespread advances in medical and behavioral research have dramatically increased the
expected lifespan and quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome (Patterns & Costa, 2005), research
examining ways to mitigate these substantial memory impairments has not capitalized on recent developments
in the understanding of human memory. In the current research, the investigators test whether a new, user-
friendly smartphone application—HippoCamera—can enhance specific autobiographical memory in individuals
with Down syndrome. In HippoCamera, users are asked to record and replay events from their daily lives. This
replay is curated by a research-based algorithm in HippoCamera that optimizes consolidation of memories
over time and targets the specific memory details that are often lacking in individuals with hippocampal
disfunction.
 The current project focuses on two potential benefits of HippoCamera in Down syndrome: 1) Increased
memory specificity of daily events that are recorded and replayed by the participant using HippoCamera, and
2) Global enhancements in memory specificity for all autobiographical memories following a 12-week
HippoCamera intervention. Prior research in older adults with and without cognitive decline has shown
significant increases in memory specificity following a HippoCamera intervention (Martin et al., 2022). It is,
therefore, likely that similar enhancements in autobiographical memory specificity will be identified in
individuals with Down syndrome, highlighting the benefits of the application in this population. Exploratory
analyses will further explore whether HippoCamera may also support increased positive sentiment for recorded
memories (Martin et al., 2022) or more general increases in participant well-being and autonomy."

This project aims to unlock the potential of combining wearable mobile recording devices, such as
smartphones with continuous audio-visual, accelerometry, GPS, subjective report, autonomic physiology, and
wearable eye tracking recordings, with precisely synchronized intracranial neural recordings during real-world
behaviors. Autobiographical memory (AM) formation is a critical human behavior that has been difficult to study
with traditional neuroimaging methods. It involves a range of real-world cognitive processes, including
attention, decision making, emotion, episodic memory, social interactions, and navigation. AM refers to
memory for one’s own life experiences. AMs are typically more detailed and personal than general episodic
memories and due to this feature have thus been difficult to capture as they are being formed, particularly the
neural correlates of AM encoding. By studying how the brain processes, encodes, and retrieves verifiable,
real-world autobiographical experiences, we hope to gain new insights into cognitive and neural processes that
can fail in neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease. There is a critical need to develop technical,
methodological, and computational approaches to understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms
underlying memory-related behaviors in continuous, complex real-world settings, to then translate this
understanding into reliable treatments for enhancing memory or cognition in daily life. The proposed project will
take important first steps towards addressing these dire needs with a novel and unique approach to recording
directly from the human brain as people navigate and create AMs in the temporal contexts and at the spatial
scales of daily life. By capturing electrophysiological recordings synchronized with a novel experiential
recording device, our project will take the key translational step needed to push our neuroscientific insights of
autobiographical memory from the laboratory to one day restoring real-world memory for those suffering from
devastating memory disorders. As neural stimulation tools and techniques for memory enhancement develop,
insights from the proposed study will establish the foundation on which to build neuromodulation approaches
that can rescue memory during real-world experiences. Thus the proposed research project aims to develop a
smartphone-based recording application (CAPTURE app; R61 phase) synchronized with wearables and
invasive neural recordings during real-world behaviors like autobiographical memory encoding (R33 phase).
We will develop novel recording and analytic methods for integrating multimodal data streams with invasive
neural recordings in humans during real-world experiences. Over 2,000 potential research participants have
sensing and stimulation devices (i.e., NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulation System; RNS) chronically
implanted in their brains for the treatment of epilepsy in the U.S. Our next-generation tool and approach will
allow us to precisely capture real-world behaviors that encompass a variety of cognitive processes like
autobiographical memory formation, and synchronize this data with direct neural recordings in humans."

 The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plasticity of excitatory synapses have fascinated
biologists for many decades. In addition to the importance of these processes in the acquisition and storage of
memories, as well as other adaptations of neural circuits to sensory input or other changing conditions, many of
the effector genes that participate in such mechanisms have recently been associated with a wide range of
neurological, psychiatric and other disorders of the human nervous system. Thus, it is little surprise that synapse
formation, plasticity and structural remodeling are under tight control at many levels. To better understand this,
we have investigated small, non-coding microRNA genes that serve as versatile yet selective regulators of
dynamic gene expression changes that underly the morphological plasticity of the synapse. Through multiple
rounds of genetic tool development, screening, and tissue-specific analysis, we have identified several highly
conserved microRNAs that are required in the postsynaptic cell to allow coordinated remodeling of the synapse
in response to acute stimulation. Because each microRNA controls the expression of specific target mRNAs, our
studies have led us to several key proteins whose expression must be downregulated to allow synapse
remodeling. In particular, our unpublished analysis of miR-219 suggests that it controls expression of a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific to the Ral GTPase. Although this Ras-independent GEF (dRalGPS)
is very highly conserved, there are no peer reviewed publications on the Drosophila ortholog. Moreover, while
fly miR-219 is perfectly conserved with human miR-219a, and the miR-219 response element (MRE) in RalGPS
is also conserved across species, this relationship has escaped study by other labs. Prior work on Ral at the
Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) delineated a pathway that mediates morphogenesis the
subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) by recruiting Sec5 and other Exocyst components in response to neural activity.
Analysis of our unpublished null mutation, expression transgenes, and antibodies against dRalGPS show that,
like Ral, this Ral GEF is both necessary and sufficient to control the postsynaptic recruitment of key determinants
of SSR structure. However, our biochemical isolation of protein complexes and subsequent genetic analysis of
RalGPS-associated factors suggests that RalGPS may mediate several biological outputs in addition to sec5.
Moreover, biochemical isolation of Argonaut 1 complexes suggests that miR-219 loading into miRISC is activity-
dependent, implicating this cytoskeletal effector pathway is part of an acute synapse plasticity mechanism yet to
be studied in our system. We propose to rigorously test this model with a combination of site-directed
mutagenesis and tissue-specific analysis (Aim 1), genetic epistasis and protein localization studies (Aim 2), and
thorough regulatory analysis of the target genes to address their dependence on miR-219 and other synaptic
microRNA (Aim 3)."

 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common adult leukemia and has a very poor prognosis; most
patients diagnosed with AML will die from this disease. AML results from uncontrolled proliferation of poorly
differentiated myeloid precursor cells. Immune therapies, including checkpoint blockade, are currently being
studied in the context of AML. Our previous work has established that the percentage of T cells present in the
bone marrow of patients with AML at the time of diagnosis correlates with overall survival, providing evidence
that the adaptive immune system, and specifically T cells, are able to recognize malignant cells. Our lab and
others have shown that AML evades attack by the immune system by suppressing T cell function. Significantly,
this functional suppression can be reversed in vitro in most cases by immune checkpoint molecule blockade.
 Previous literature has demonstrated that the exhausted state of the immune system can result from an
epigenetic program imparted on T cells after chronic stimulation. We have previously shown a role for the map
kinase pathway (MAPK) in maintaining this exhausted state in T cells present in AML. Transformation of cells to
AML results from a combination of mutations affecting proliferation, differentiation and epigenetic state. For this
reason, drugs targeting signaling and epigenetic state are approved or are being actively studied for the
treatment of AML.
 For this project, our long-term goals are to provide a better understanding of functional T cell exhaustion
and its relevance in AML. Our immediate goal is to study the role of the MAPK pathway, DNA methyltransferases
and the epigenetic reader BET proteins in T cell exhaustion in the context of AML. We will conduct these studies
with the central hypothesis that immune evasion via T cell exhaustion in AML is imparted by signaling pathways
such as MEK and epigenetic states in T cells and that targeting these pathways in AML will reverse immune
suppression. To accomplish this goal, we propose the following three aims: 1) Understand the role of the MAPK
pathway on T cell function in AML. This will consist of mechanistic studies in T cells, but also study tumor and
other lymphoid and myeloid populations in the immune microenvironment of AML. 2) Assess the impact of
epigenetic pathways on the immunological function of T cells in mouse models of AML. Based on our preliminary
data we will focus on DNA methylation and BET protein function. 3) Define cells and pathways of immune
suppression in the tumor microenvironment of human AML. We will study a cell type associated with T cell
suppression in patient samples. We will also study effects of MEK, BET and DNMT inhibitors on patient samples.
 Together these experiments will give us a better understanding of the biology of T cell exhaustion in AML
disease. Importantly, results from these studies will have impact on treatment of this lethal disease by allowing
rational design of combined small molecule and immune targeted therapies."

 Breast cancer patients represent fast-growing medical cannabis and cannabinoid (MCC) users in this
country; a recent survey indicates that about 42% of breast cancer patients use MCC to alleviate treatment-
related symptoms, and many of these patients do not discuss their use with their oncologists. Despite being
considered safe and well-tolerated, MCC may result in potential interactions with cancer treatments, adverse
reactions, and tumor progression. Unfortunately, despite the increase in MCC use, research on its health effects,
including the potential benefits and harms, remains limited. Therefore, we propose a prospective cohort study
of breast cancer patients (50% underserved minorities) to address gaps in knowledge and build evidence of
the types of products in use, frequency, dosage of use, and the benefits and harms of MCC use during and after
cancer treatment. Our central hypothesis is that MCC may improve treatment-related symptoms and clinical
outcomes in some patients by targeting the inflammasome/inflammatory pathway. Therapeutic strategies
targeting inflammasome may prevent treatment-related symptoms and improve clinical outcomes. We will test a
new paradigm that the inhibition of inflammasome-mediated inflammatory responses by MCC plays a role in its
biological effects. We plan to enroll 600 breast cancer patients (300 MCC users and 300 non-MCC users) and
collect data on patient characteristics, treatment plans, clinician-reported outcomes, adverse reactions, and
patient-reported outcomes. We will monitor MCC use through in-person visits and technology-based
assessments such as smartphone and sensor-based measurement bursts. We will also collect blood samples
for MCC quantitation/characterization and inflammasome/inflammatory biomarkers. Aim 1 will evaluate the
benefits and harms of MCC in breast cancer patients during and after treatment. Aim 2 will elucidate whether
inflammasome/inflammatory biomarkers mediate the benefits and harms of MCC in breast cancer therapies and
other medications used. Aim 3 will investigate how MCC product characteristics impact benefits and harms (Aim
1) and inflammasome and inflammatory biomarkers (Aim 2). Leveraging our promising preliminary data, a
diverse patient population, state-of-the-art high-throughput technologies, and a multidisciplinary research team
with complementary expertise, we are well-positioned to conduct this study and address the scientific
knowledge gaps surrounding the benefits and harms of MCC in breast cancer patients. We will provide scientific
evidence on the impact of MCC on breast cancer patients during and after treatments, the biological effects of
MCC during treatments, potential interactions between MCC and cancer therapies and other medications, and
the types and patterns of MCC use that present the best benefits/harms ratio. Our results will be of great value
to physicians and cancer patients, as they will inform decision-making regarding MCC to enhance therapies,
improve quality of life, and minimize adverse effects. If funded, we will work closely with the coordinating center
and NCI in sharing assessment measures and disseminating study findings."
10792346,"The greatest risk factor for development of allergies and asthma in offspring is a parental history of allergic
disease. Maternal transmission of reactivity that is not specific for allergen has been demonstrated in patients
and animal models. We demonstrated that there are increased numbers of subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) in
the fetal liver and offspring of allergic mothers. In preliminary animal studies, intratracheal transfer of lung
dendritic cells (DCs) or lung microbiota from neonates of allergic mothers transfers allergen responsiveness to
recipient neonates of non-allergic mothers. The mechanisms for regulation of offspring DCs and allergy by
factors from allergic mothers are not well defined. We propose the novel concept that increases in the
eicosanoids dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) in allergic mothers are transported to the offspring, where
the DHETs regulate development of lung microbiota dysbiosis and offspring responsiveness to allergens. In our
preliminary lipidomics analyses, DHETs but not other eicosanoids were elevated in plasma of allergic mothers
and in fetuses, suggesting a potential function of this eicosanoid in development of allergy. In preliminary studies,
the development of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) was increased in vitro by DHET; also human cord blood
DHET levels correlated with infant wheeze. However, regulatory functions of maternal DHETs in the
development of offspring DCs and allergy are not known. Unknown are mechanisms for 1) maternal increases
in DHET, 2) DHET regulation of DC development in offspring, and 3) the reciprocity between lung microbiome
and host eicosanoid metabolism. Our long-term goal is to identify mechanisms for maternal DHET regulation
of offspring development of allergic responses. As a step towards our goal, our central HYPOTHESIS is that
increases in DHET levels in allergic mothers regulate the development of offspring numbers of pro-allergic DC
subsets, lung microbiota dysbiosis, and responses to allergen early in life. We will test our central hypothesis
with the following aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that, a mechanism for increasing responsiveness to allergen
in offspring of allergic mothers is increased maternal lung DHETs that are transferred in utero to the fetus and in
milk to neonates. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that increased levels of DHETs in allergic mothers is a mechanism
for increased hematopoiesis of fetal liver and pup bone marrow DC subsets and DC function in allergic
responses. We will also determine whether human cord blood plasma DHETs associate with infant atopy and
DC numbers. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that increased DHETs of allergic mothers is a mechanism for induction
of maternal and neonate lung microbiome dysbiosis, thereby increasing the abundance of lung bacteria that
metabolize DHETs that then sustain increased offspring DC responsiveness to allergen. In human infants, we
will determine whether cord blood eicosanoid profiles associate with infant airway bacterial microbiota, lung
function, and wheeze. Completion of these studies will have a significant impact on understanding mechanisms
of maternal lipid regulation of offspring DCs during development of allergies and design of future clinical studies."

Over 30 million people worldwide remain undiagnosed for a common cardiovascular genetic disorder, familial
hypercholesteremia (FH). Individuals with FH can significantly reduce their high risk of premature
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) if they are identified early in life and initiate lipid lowering
treatment promptly. Suboptimal implementation and understanding of costs to implement screening programs
has resulted in fewer individuals with FH being identified, resulting in a substantial population living with
unmanaged risk for ASCVD. In this renewal application, we will address questions regarding generalizability,
costs, and sustainability of initial findings from IMPACT-FH. Implementation strategies for cascade testing
reported in the initial IMPACT-FH study were evaluated in specialty care settings (genetic) at Geisinger; they
need to be tested and adapted for primary care settings and institutions beyond Geisinger. Implementation
costs are important to consider when health systems make decisions about when a prevention program is
feasible and whether it can be deployed with a high level of success. Sustainability should be built into care
strategies and include cost analyses. Currently, FH screening programs exist all over the world in varying
forms of maturity in middle- and high-income countries but little is known about factors that promote or hinder
sustainability or promoters to improve existing programs. The main objective of this renewal application to the
IMPACT-FH study is to decrease the FH-associated burden of ASCVD by testing the applicability of our
cascade testing strategies in the primary care setting, estimating, and comparing the implementation costs and
performance of FH screening strategies, and measuring the sustainability of the FH screening programs in
real-world contexts. Our specific aims are to: 1) optimize and compare FH cascade testing uptake (adoption)
among FH patients offered one of the cascade testing implementation strategies with their relatives versus
those who do not use a strategy, 2) calculate and compare implementation costs, efficiency, and performance
FH screening strategies, 3) explore sustainability of FH screening programs."

We propose to continue to serve as a Regional Coordinating Center (RCC) for Stroke Net that will continue to perform stroke-related clinical trials, bring new trials to the network, and train new stroke investigators. Our RCC includes University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland Clinic, Metro Health Medical Center, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Administration Medical Center, all affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. Our RCC, initially funded in 2013 and renewed in 2018, subsequently expanded to include additional sites at Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo, Ohio; OhioHealth in Columbus, Ohio; Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, Michigan; West Virginia University Healthcare in Morgantown, West Virginia; and Allegheny Health in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We also reduced the number of sites by removing community hospitals that were not actively screening or enrolling in Stroke Net. Our RCC contains a variety of hospital types, including a county hospital with a large emergency department, a VA hospital, multiple urban academic medical centers, and an academic medical center in a rural state, ensuring a diverse patient and study population. Our key personnel represent a diverse group composed of neurologists, neurosurgeons, emergency medicine specialists, neurointerventionalists, neurointensivists, pediatric neurologists, neuroradiologists, vascular surgeons, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists. Our RCC has a track record of enrolling patients in acute treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation studies. We have brought new projects to the network and have representatives on all Stroke Net working groups. Our RCC consists of eight Comprehensive Stroke Centers; state-of-the-art transportation resources, including critical care air transport with physicians and nurse practitioners on board; and three hospital systems with mobile stroke units that administer thrombolytics in the field or en route to the hospital. We have special expertise in penumbral imaging, acute endovascular therapy, and rehabilitation, especially functional electrical stimulation. We propose to continue the current leadership with co-PIs Drs. Sophia Sundararajan and Ken Uchino and representatives from the nine hospitals. David Haney will continue as Project Manager, and Dr. Irene Katzan will continue as Training Director. This leadership will oversee the RCC and provide mentorship for additional junior investigators. Our leadership succession plan has already successfully mentored Drs. Sundararajan and Uchino, who assumed roles as co-PIs with the 2018 renewal of the RCC. With the expertise and resources detailed in this application, the Case Western Reserve University RCC will be well positioned to enhance the structure and organization of our RCC and further accelerate participation in clinical trials for stroke prevention, acute intervention, and rehabilitation in adults and children."

This proposal outlines a 5-year mentored career development plan as a physician-scientist for Anita Saraf, MD,
PhD as the principal investigator. Dr. Saraf is a tenure-track Assistant Professor at University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine. She completed her graduate training through the Medical Scientist Training Program at
Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX with a Ph.D. in Bioengineering through the William Marsh Rice
University. Subsequently, she completed her residency and fellowship through the ABIM research pathway at
Emory University, Atlanta, GA and completed subspeciality training in Adult Congenital Heart Disease. Dr.
Saraf’s post-graduate research has focused on translational and basic science studies involving biomarker
profiles in single ventricle Fontan patients and understanding the effect of these biomarkers in cardiomyocytes
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Under the combined mentorship of Drs. Bernhard Kühn
and Toren Finkel (co-mentor), Dr. Saraf proposes to further her research skill-set in gene-editing and
cardiomyocyte physiology, with a long-term goal of establishing herself as a leader in translational and basic
science research in congenital heart disease.
In this proposal, Dr. Saraf investigates the role of NOTCH1 hypomorphic mutations in inducing arrhythmias
and heart failure in patient-derived and engineered cardiomyocytes from iPSCs. Using iPSCs from NOTCH1
hypomorphic patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and engineering similar hypomorphic
mutations in control iPSCs with CRISPR gene-editing, Dr. Saraf proposes the following objectives: (1)
Determine the influence of inflammatory cytokines (found to chronically elevated in univentricular patients) on
hypomorphic NOTCH1 cardiomyocytes and (2) Determine the influence of systemic pressures on hypomorphic
NOTCH1 cardiomyocytes, with respect to abnormal calcium-handling and contractility.
Given the lack of viable animal models for congenital heart disease, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes together
with gene-editing technology provides a powerful platform to understand abnormalities in cardiomyocyte
physiology, discover novel targets for therapy, and create viable animal models with similar hypomorphic
mutations in the future. In addition to research training, Drs. Kühn, Finkel and Saraf have formulated a clear
timeline for career development involving publications, presentations at meetings and courses in leadership
that will transition Dr. Saraf to independence as a leader in this field."
10794302,"Today, 20% of adolescents and 26% of young adults have a diagnosable internalizing (e.g. anxiety, depression)
or externalizing problem (e.g. impulsivity, aggression, conduct disorders). Neurodevelopmental disabilities and
mental health disorders in adolescents and young adults have increased over the last two decades worldwide,
and environmental contaminants may explain a part of this increase. The most used insecticides worldwide
include organophosphates (OPs: inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), pyrethroids and neonicotinoids.
Toxicological and epidemiological evidence links OP exposure with altered neurocognitive performance.
Additionally, a small number of studies have described associations with internalizing symptoms and some
externalizing behaviors (i.e. low inhibitory control). It is plausible neonicotinoids may also affect brain
processes as they share some toxicological mechanisms like OPs and emerging findings indicate pyrethroids
may affect brain processes and neurobehavior. Further, emerging studies suggest that pesticides may
transiently affect cognitive performance and mood. Assessing transient health outcomes is complex, which has
led to limited knowledge on this field. We propose a renewal of our 2016 study of adolescents and young adults
(ages 18-23 years in 2022, n≈554) and builds on the planned 2022 follow-up exam of the NIH-funded Study of
Secondary Pesticide Exposures among Children and Adolescents (ESPINA). The proposed study incorporates a
novel mobile health assessment tool to evaluate the real-world neurotoxic effects of pesticides. ESPINA is a
study established in 2008 of participants residing in Pedro Moncayo, Ecuador, a county with one of the highest
concentrations of flower plantations in the Americas. Leveraging our smartphone-based ecological momentary
cognitive testing (EMCT) platform, we will assess whether recurring and seasonal pesticide exposures in
adolescence and young adulthood affect cognition and mental health. Using a burst sampling design 5
times/year for 2 years during high- and low-pesticide spray seasons, we will test the hypotheses: 1) pesticide
spray seasons are associated with cyclical alterations in internalizing symptoms, externalizing behaviors, and
cognitive performance assessed using EMCT; 2) pesticide exposures (AChE inhibition and OP and pyrethroid
urinary pesticide metabolites) assessed during 5 agricultural periods are related to elevated depressive and
externalizing symptoms, and decreased cognitive performance assessed using EMCT; 3) Urinary pesticide
metabolites (OP, neonicotinoids, pyrethroids) are associated with increased mental health symptoms from
2016 to 2022 when all participants were adolescents, and whether age, sex and COVID-19-related factors (e.g.,
exposure; psychosocial stressors) modify the associations between environmental exposures and mental
health. Identifying cognitive and mental health sequelae related to agricultural pesticide spray seasons on
people living in agricultural settings will advance this understudied field of research and has significant
implications for public health."

Bone metastasis remains a major cause of death among patients with prostate cancer. Unfortunately, current
treatments for bone metastases are mainly palliative. A major complication of bone metastasis is bone pain.
Although several lines of study have suggested that nerves have a role in cancer progression, and that bone
pain and overall survival are negatively correlated, the mechanisms involved remain elusive. We have found
that: 1) cancer metastasis to bone or metastatic bone disease enriches sensory nerves that express the
neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the bone, and that causes bone pain; 2) bone-metastatic
cancer cells express elevated levels of calcitonin-receptor like receptor (CRLR); 3) CGRP induces cancer
proliferation through the CRLR/p38 pathway; 4) activated FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) is present
in the dorsal root ganglia of mice presenting bone pain indicators; 5) bone-metastatic cancer cells express
elevated levels of the Flt3 ligand (FL); and 6) FL induces the sprouting of sensory nerves. We therefore
hypothesize that (a) FL derived from bone-metastatic prostate cancer stimulates sensory nerves through Flt3,
resulting in cancer-induced bone pain; and (b) CGRP expressed by cancer-associated sensory nerves induces
progression of metastatic bone disease through the CRLR/p38 pathway. In this R01 proposal, submitted in
response to PAR-16-245, we will: (1) Determine whether bone-metastatic cancer cells increase sensory nerve
sprouting and CGRP synthesis in sensory nerves, contributing to cancer-induced bone pain, through the FL/Flt3
axis; and (2) Determine whether CGRP expressed by sensory nerves in bone-metastatic lesions stimulate bone
metastatic outgrowth through CRLR/p38. Using an in vitro primary dorsal root ganglia culture system and a
unique mouse model of cancer-induced bone pain, will allow us to measure within the same animal: (i) tumor
growth, (ii) skeletal innervation, (iii) bone remodeling, and (iv) resultant pain behaviors. Using bone biopsies from
patients, we will probe the molecular mechanisms whereby the crosstalk between bone metastatic cancer and
sensory nerves controls both progression of bone metastases and development of associated pain. We will use
these results to develop a new therapeutic strategy targeting cancer/nerve interactions. In the short term, this
study will elucidate new mechanisms of bone metastasis and cancer-induced bone pain. In the long run, a better
understanding of how metastatic progression and pain signals influence one another to worsen disease
progression will aid in discovering new therapeutic targets for both cancer-induced bone pain and bone
metastatic cancer – areas in which current therapies are wanting – to decrease suffering and improve the survival
of cancer patients with bone metastases."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a paradigm for comprehensive whole genome sequencing
(WGS) studies of complex genetic diseases and traits by leveraging new approaches for variant analysis and
trait association, and to use these methods for improving disease and trait mapping studies, using coronary
artery disease as a prototypical example. We will first build a new WGS variant analysis pipeline based on
methods that interrogate a population of fully assembled reference genomes from diverse populations (a
“pangenome”), rather than a single reference genome (e.g. GRCh38). By employing variation-aware
approaches to read alignment and genotyping, these next-generation methods promise to greatly improve
variant detection performance and to alleviate the ancestry bias that plagues the current generation of
methods. Our pipeline will be designed to detect all forms of variation, including single nucleotide variants,
small indels, structural variation, and tandem repeat length variation, and will be constructed based on
systematic benchmarking of candidate methods from our labs and the broader community. We will then use
these methods in combination with ancestry-aware trait association approaches to study the complex genetic
basis of coronary artery disease and cardiometabolic risk factors in a set of ~55,000 deeply sequenced human
genomes from diverse ancestry groups, generated by the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG).
We will assess the contribution of all variant types to coronary artery disease and complex coronary disease
risk factors and quantify the improvements in gene mapping studies of common disease that are possible
using new pangenomic analysis methods. We will leverage continental admixture, local ancestry patterns, and
a novel tree-based haplotype association method to fine map novel and known coronary artery disease and
risk factor loci, and to identify loci where local ancestry modulates risk of coronary disease and risk factors.
Finally, we will extend this work to a much larger set of individuals and traits by applying our methods to WGS
data from public biobanks allowing us to more broadly assess the role of complex genome variation in human
diseases and complex traits. Taken together, this work will yield valuable new methods and data resources for
the community, will help pave the way to improve the next generation of human disease gene mapping studies
by using pangenomic approaches, and has the potential to yield new insight into the multi-ethnic genetic basis
of coronary artery disease."

Recently, we made a novel and exciting discovery that tumors or the tumor microenvironment (TME) cause T-
cell dysfunction and death by inducing ferroptosis in T cells. We analyzed the sc-RNA-seq data of tumor-
infiltrating T cells from melanoma patients and discovered that tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells had significantly
increased expressions of genes associated with lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis compared to blood CD8+ T
cells from healthy individuals. More importantly, our unpublished studies further revealed that among different
CD8+ T cell subpopulations, effector memory (TEM) and terminally differentiated effector (TTE) CD8+ T cells are
more sensitive to tumor-induced ferroptosis. We examined tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells from the bone
marrow (BM; tumor bed) of patients with multiple myeloma. By separating the T cells into naïve, TTE or TEM
cells based on their expression of CCR7 and CD45RA, we found that TEM and TTE CD8+ T cells expressed
higher levels of lipid peroxidation- and ferroptosis-associated genes and were more sensitive to tumor-induced
ferroptosis compared to naïve CD8+ T cells although they expressed similar levels of CD36. Similarly, in
mouse melanoma and MM models, increased ferroptosis mainly occurred in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ TEM and
TTE cells but not in naïve CD8+ T cells from mice with large tumor burdens compared to those with small tumor
burdens. Our ex vivo studies confirmed that CD8+ TEM and TTE cells were more sensitive to tumor- or FA-
induced ferroptosis than naïve T cells and their production of cytotoxic cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα was
inhibited. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, RNA-seq was used and showed that CD8+ TEM and TTE
cells expressed a significantly lower level of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1 (DECR1), a rate-limiting enzyme for
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) β-oxidation, compared to naïve CD8+ T cells. Knockdown (KD) of DECR1 in
naïve CD8+ T cells resulted in an increased PUFA expression and peroxisomal dysfunction and sensitized
them to tumor- or FA-induced ferroptosis than control T cells. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize
that CD8+ TEM and TTE cells, due to uptake of more FAs and reduced expression of DECR1 and PUFA
oxidation, are sensitive to tumor/TME-induced ferroptosis, and inhibiting TEM and TTE cell ferroptosis may
effectively enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients. Aim 1 will determine the
mechanism underlying tumor- or FA-induced ferroptosis in CD8+ TEM and TTE cells in TME. Aim 2 will elucidate
the role and mechanisms of tumor and TME accumulation of FAs and induction of lipid peroxidation in CD8+
TEM and TTE T cells and Aim 3 will inhibit CD8+ TEM and TTE cell ferroptosis to enhance the efficacy of cancer
immunotherapies. Accomplishing these aims will provide us with in-depth understanding of the mechanisms
underlying how tumors and the TME induce T cell lipid peroxidation and how ferroptosis mediates T cell
metabolic malfunction and death. Understanding these mechanisms is extremely important and will greatly
assist us in developing novel therapeutic approaches to target T cell lipid metabolism and TME to significantly
improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy."
10794329,"Oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase transforms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to leukemia stem 
cells (LSCs) to induce chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) and 
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL). CML-CP may 
progress to more advanced accelerated phase (CML-AP), and subsequently to a very 
aggressive blast phase (CML-BP). Most CML/Ph+ALL patients are currently treated with 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKis) such as imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. However, it 
is unlikely that TKis will “cure” CML/Ph+ALL patients due to the presence of TKi-refractory 
cells (e.g., quiescent LSCs), TKi-resistant cells (e.g., proliferating LSCs carrying BCR-ABL1 
kinase T315I mutant) and LSCs carrying additional somatic mutations. Therefore, novel treatment 
modalities are needed to eradicate TKi-refractory/resistant CML/Ph+ALL cells in the responding 
patients and to treat patients who do not respond favorably to TKis.
CML/Ph+ALL cells accumulate more DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), the most lethal DNA 
lesions, than normal counterparts. Leukemia cells can tolerate high numbers of DSBs because the 
repair mechanisms are altered and hyper-activated. Therefore, CML/Ph+ALL cells are “addicted” 
 to these pathways to survive pro-apoptotic challenge from high numbers of lethal DSBs. There 
are critical differences between DSB repair in normal and BCR-ABL1 leukemia cells. 
Proliferating LSCs usually employ RAD52-dependent DSB repairs and PARP1 –dependent 
alternative non-homologous end-joining (Alt-NHEJ), whereas normal counterparts use 
BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination (HR) and DNA-PKcs –dependent NHEJ (D-NHEJ). Quiescent 
LSCs use PARP1-mediated Alt-NHEJ instead of DNA-PKcs –dependent D-NHEJ, which is predominant in 
normal quiescent HSCs.
Research supported by previous award demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological 
targeting of PARP1 and/or RAD52 exerted synthetic lethal effect against BCR-ABL1 –positive 
leukemias. However, somatic mutations often detected in CMLs/Ph+ALLs not responding favorably 
 to TKi and/or progressing to more malignant stages can modulate the response to PARP1 and/or 
RAD52 inhibition.
We have discovered that DNA polymerase theta (Polθ, encoded by POLQ) plays a vital role in 
microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), a branch of Alt-NHEJ. Our preliminary data indicate 
that Polθ is essential for BCR-ABL1 –mediated leukemogenesis and that targeting of Polθ eliminated 
CML/Ph+ALL cells. Aim #1 is designed to determine if/how BCR-ABL1 –mediated signaling modifies Polθ 
to regulate its biological activities and to pinpoint the role of Polθ in CML and Ph+ALL stem 
cells. Aim #2 will optimize Polθ inhibitor (Polθi) to be suitable for in vivo use. Aim #3 is 
focused on genetic and pharmacological targeting of Polθ and/or PARP1 and RAD52 against TKi-naive 
and TKi-treated CMLs/Ph+ALLs in in vitro conditions mimicking peripheral blood and bone 
marrow microenvironment and also in vivo in humanized immunodeficient mice bearing primary leukemia 
xenografts."

Alcohol (ethanol) exposure during pregnancy is the leading environmental cause of birth defects and central
nervous system dysfunction. While the effects of ethanol on the brain and face have been explored quite
extensively, there is considerable variation in the consequences of developmental ethanol exposure. Some of
this variation is due to differences in timing and amount of exposure or nutritional factors. However, even when
controlling for these factors, it is still clear that not everyone exposed to ethanol during development is affected
equally and it has become increasingly clear that genetic factors play a very significant role in fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders (FASD). Historically, elucidating these genetic factors that mediate risk or resilience has
been relatively slow and characterized by human association studies or quantitative trait loci mapping in animal
models. More recently, we have applied next generation sequencing technologies and forward genetic screens
to more rapidly identify genes and pathways that alter susceptibility to prenatal ethanol exposure. These
studies have taken advantage of varied mouse strains with differential alcohol susceptibility, numerous
transgenic mouse lines, and high throughput zebrafish genetic analyses and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
techniques. In this current proposal, we will further these approaches with the combination of the powerful
genomic analyses capabilities of the Collaborative Cross mouse genetics tools. In Aim 1, we will explore
mechanisms underlying ethanol sensitivity using complementary mouse and fish transgenic lines, while
identifying further candidate genes via comparisons of the highly ethanol susceptible mouse strain, C57BL/6J
vs. the highly ethanol resistant strain 129S1/Svlmj. This comparison will be aided by embryonic transcriptomic
(RNA-Seq) analyses, selective crossbreeding to induce susceptibility in a resistant line (129) with extensive
genome sequencing analyses. Aim 2 will significantly expand our genomic analyses by examining CC founder
strains for their susceptibility to ethanol followed by transcriptomic profiling of susceptible and resistant strains.
Conserved candidate genes and pathways will be further tested and characterized in our high throughput
zebrafish phenotyping analyses. Aim 3 will take a complementary bioinformatic approach by identifying
chemical modifiers of gene-ethanol interactions in a high throughput zebrafish screen with further confirmation
in our mouse model of FASD. This proposal brings together experts on mouse and fish genetics, embryology
and alcohol teratology. Together, these experiments will greatly enhance our understanding of the genetic
etiology of ethanol-induced brain and craniofacial malformations during early embryonic development, as well
as aiding in the identification of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in FASD."
11030744,"Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia. PTSD
and dementia co-occur more often than expected by chance. One potential reason for this
comorbidity is that AD genes may influence the risk for both AD and PTSD. APOE, the strongest
AD genetic risk factor, has also been implicated as a risk factor for combat-related PTSD. The
initial effects of these genes may be apparent in middle age, ahead of the usual age of AD onset.
Our recent MRI study found that an AD polygenic risk score (PRS; a genome-wide summary
measure of genetic risk) by mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) interaction was associated with
cortical thickness and memory performance in a VA sample with mean age 35. In this project,
we will use Million Veterans Project data to examine association between AD risk genes and early
cognitive function deficits and PTSD symptomatology. Our AD genetic risk measures will include
a genome-wide measure of AD risk (PRS), APOE genotypes, and AD GWAS implicated variants
in genes such as ABCA7, CLU, and TNXRD1. We will evaluate the potential gene x environment
(GxE) effects between AD genes and TBI and combat trauma exposure. As early detection of AD
risk may be critical for treatment, we will be especially interested in identifying cognitive
phenotypes associated with AD risk ahead of the typical age of onset. Hence, we will perform
analyses within three age strata: early middle age (45-54), late middle age (55-64), and old age
(65+). Our measures of cognitive performance will include the presence/absence of a cognitive
impairment diagnosis in the medical record and factor scores computed from self-reported
cognitive impairment (MVP Lifestyle Survey Items) which we will validate using available cognitive
testing data from the medical record (e.g. MMSE and MOCA). Next, we will examine the potential
impact of AD genes on PTSD risk as well as potential GxE interactions involving trauma and TBI.
Finally, we will use a retrospective longitudinal design to determine if AD gene x TBI and trauma
interactions impact the progression to AD. With nearly half of all veterans over age 65, and many
at risk for cognitive impairment and subsequent AD, it is critical to advance methods for early
identification and treatment of cognitive symptoms and dementia. Understanding the interaction
between genetic risk and history of military trauma will be essential for tailoring early detection
methods to a veteran population. !"
10792358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic neuropathic pain impacts up to 69% of adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). Current accessible treat- ment options are limited and are primarily pain medications with insufficient benefits and significant risks for addiction and adverse effects. Of the available mind and body approaches, Qigong is the most accessible for adults with SCI with evidence for effectiveness in reducing pain, but there is not enough evidence to make rec- ommendations for adults with SCI. Thus, the feasibility of Qigong in SCI needs to be established.
To support our feasibility study, we investigated a 12-week remote Qigong program in adults with SCI and neu- ropathic pain. We recruited 23 adults with SCI, 18 completed the study, and 12 completed the 1-year follow-up. They practiced Qigong more (138%) than the required intensity (at least 3x/week with Qigong video through the internet). The 18 participants had an average age of 59 years, were on average 15 years post-SCI, 33% were women, 39% were older adults, 33% lived in rural areas, 17% were veterans, 67% were in socio-eco- nomic distress, 56% had paraplegia, 44% had tetraplegia, 33% had a complete SCI, and all were non-Hispanic Whites. Their pain was reduced by 44% after 12 weeks of Qigong and was still reduced at the 6-week and 1- year follow-up. However, despite the promising data, 3 key elements are missing and need to be addressed before performing a larger effectiveness study: lack of data from adults with SCI from diverse backgrounds on
(1) feasibility and acceptability of participating in a Qigong study; (2) on the feasibility of the study design (in- cluding a control group) and Qigong adherence; as well as (3) the lack of objective outcome measures.
This R34 feasibility study, the HAPPINESS trial (cHAnging the Perceived Pain INtensity in divErSe popu- lations with Spinal cord injury), will expand on our prior study to consolidate feasibility with a rigorous proto- col. Our diverse multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to address the following aims: AIM 1. To identify the facilitators/barriers to participating in a Qigong study through focus groups and interviews with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, defined as Hispanics, veterans, and adults living in rural, underserved areas. AIM
2. To establish the feasibility of study design/methods of the HAPPINESS trial in adults with SCI (with at least 50% from diverse backgrounds) through pre-specified targets for recruitment/enrollment, feasibility, and ac- ceptability of design and outcomes. Using a Phase I randomized controlled trial design, 40 adults with SCI-re- lated neuropathic pain will be randomized to 12-week remote Qigong intervention or pain management with a HIPAA-compliant ‘Manage My Pain Pro app + 6-month follow-up. Aligned with NCCIH’s mission and its top re- search priorities, the study results will facilitate a rigorous structure to design larger effectiveness studies and facilitate a clear pathway for researchers to investigate Qigong and other mind-body approaches for whole- person health (including pain management) in diverse groups of adults with chronic/neurological disorders."
10793062,"PROJECT SUMMARY
E-cigarette use (vaping) in 18-24-year-olds is a public health crisis. It is an urgent public health
priority to communicate to young adults about the health harm of vaping to stop and prevent
them from vaping. However, effective communication has become challenging in the new age of
health misinformation and low trust in health experts. My goal is to investigate the role of a
trusted source and strategic message presentation to increase young adults’ acceptance of e-
cigarette education messages to impact their behavior. In this two-phased study, I will determine
an optimal source and message presentation type for young adult vapers and non-vapers,
respectively (K99) and examine the effects of messages optimized for source and presentation
on young adults’ vaping cessation and vaping prevention (R00). In phase 1 (K99), I will use a
multi-method approach to examine two source (expert and peer) and two message presentation
types (one-sided and two-sided) to identify the optimal message type for each vaping status
population. First, I will use crowdsourcing testing to collect self-report measures on message
acceptance, source trust, message reactance, and harm perceptions. Second, I will use
psychophysiological testing to measure participants’ eye-tracking, heart rate, and skin
conductance to assess their visual attention, orienting responses, and arousal during message
exposure. I will produce a single dataset integrating the crowdsourced and psychophysiological
data to determine the optimal source and presentation type for vapers and non-vapers. In phase
2 (R00), I will use a text messaging intervention in a randomized trial to examine the behavioral
effects of messages optimized for source and presentation to one’s vaping status (vapers and
non-vapers). Participants in each vaping status will be randomized to either the treatment
(receiving e-cigarette education messages with a source and presentation type optimized to
one’s vaping status) or control arm (receiving non-tobacco health messages) via text messaging
over the course of 6 months. I will examine vaping cessation rates among vapers and vaping
initiation rates among non-vapers. Results will inform the public health communication
campaign development and may apply to other public education campaigns to reduce tobacco
use in young people."

10796709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of inhibitory antibodies against factor VIII (FVIII), which is referred to as FVIII inhibitors, is not
only a significant complication of protein replacement therapy but also a major concern in gene therapy of
hemophilia A. Generation of such inhibitors in protein replacement therapy might potentially preclude gene
therapy for hemophilia A, or results in a failure in gene therapy. Our long-term goals are to formulate innovative
safe and effective approaches for gene therapy of hemophilia A, including hemophilia A with inhibitors. We
hypothesize that targeting the production of FVIII to platelets that activate at the site where FVIII is needed
could overcome the presence of inhibitors. We further hypothesize that targeting FVIII expression in platelets
that will undergo apoptosis when aged will modulate the immune response to the neo-protein, promoting
immune tolerance to FVIII. We have developed a clinically translatable gene therapy protocol for hemophilia A
using lentiviral gene delivery of the FVIII expression cassette under the control of the platelet-specific αIIb
promoter (2bF8) to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) via transduction followed by transplantation, resulting in
FVIII expression in platelets. Our previous studies have demonstrated that 2bF8 lentiviral gene delivery to
HSCs can effectively introduce sustained therapeutic levels of platelet-FVIII expression and induce FVIII-
specific immune tolerance in hemophilia A mice even with pre-existing anti-FVIII immunity when sufficient
preconditioning is employed. In the current application, we propose three specific aims to further pursuit of our
long-term goal. In Aim 1, we will investigate how platelet biological activities impact platelet-specific FVIII gene
therapy of hemophilia A. In Aim 2, we will dissect the underlying mechanisms of how immune responses can
be modified in platelet gene therapy. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the safety issue of the long-term genotoxicity in
lentivirus-mediated platelet gene therapy of hemophiliacs. Through these studies, we expect to develop a safe,
curative platelet gene therapy protocol that will not only restore hemostasis but also induce immune tolerance
for all hemophilia A patients, including patients with pre-existing anti-FVIII immunity. These studies will have a
significant impact on the hemophilia A community. Furthermore, these studies will also help us to understand
the biological properties of platelets and FVIII and their interaction in the blood coagulation cascade."
10799636,"In the past decade, there has been an explosion of data collected from biological and biomedical systems, both
in terms of type and volume. Mining these high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and often dynamic datasets to
make biologically or medically important inferences or develop predictive models requires new sophisticated
data analytics methods. New machine learning methods have begun filling this gap, but most of these methods
generate “black box” models that lack clear interpretability. Additionally, these methods are associative, and are
thus incapable of teasing out the complex cause-effect relationships among features in the dataset. Directed
causal graphical models (DCGMs) are a powerful tool for filling this gap. DCGMs, learned from observational
datasets, can represent causal relationships between variables. This allows DCGMs to generate hypotheses of
mechanisms and construct parsimonious, causally informed predictive models. However, biomedical datasets
often have features that make it difficult to construct causal graphical models over the full dataset. Examples
include: data type heterogeneity, high dimensionality, multicollinearity, cyclicity, and nonstationarity. To address
these problems, I propose to develop methods for learning causal graphs in datasets containing (1) a
heterogeneous mixture of continuous, categorical, and censored variables, (2) high dimensionality and
multicollinearity, and (3) cyclicity and nonstationarity. In Aim 1, I will develop a new causal discovery algorithm
that accommodates continuous, categorical and censored variables (e.g., survival). In Aim 2, I will test and
compare various methods for matrix decomposition and dimensionality reduction in their ability to learn a
meaningful low-dimensional latent feature space to be used in graph learning methods. In Aim 3, I will develop
a new method for causal discovery in dynamic, possibly cyclic, gene regulatory networks at single cell resolution.
In all cases, testing and validation will be performed on synthetic and real-life publicly available datasets. These
methodological improvements constitute important steps forward in the field of causal discovery and they can
be utilized together or independently to provide a flexible and powerful platform for analysis of a wide range of
biomedical datasets. Once made available, they will enable researchers to make inferences about causal
mechanisms, generate hypotheses, and build robust, parsimonious predictive models."

This proposal builds upon more than 15 years of successful US-Mongolia research collaborations in
developing an innovative research training program to build sustainable environmental and occupational
research capacity in Mongolia. In recent decades, Mongolia has experienced major economic and
environmental changes, and suffered from new environmental and occupational diseases. Countering these
health threats often requires interdisciplinary collaborations that will influence national policy. Duke University
and the Mongolian National University of Medial Sciences are well-positioned to meet these challenges,
especially those regarding the interactions of air pollution and respiratory viral infections which will be a major
research theme for this program. Our proposed Mongolian Center for Environmental & Occupational Health will
foster close collaborations between US and Mongolian environmental and occupational health professionals in
solving Mongolian’s complex health problems. The goal of this Center is to develop independent,
interdisciplinary, environmental and occupational health researchers. This U2R proposal outlines the training
components of the Center. The twin U01 proposal outline the research components of the Center. Regarding
U2R training, through a national search and a competitive process, we will screen and select five well-qualified
Mongolian candidates for fellowship training each year. Fellows must have appropriate previous training at the
PhD or MS level, must be committed to careers in research, and must be available fulltime for at least 15
months of financially supported training. The Administrative Oversight Committee will work with each Fellow in
identifying a US and a Mongolian Program Faculty member with whom the Fellow will develop an
interdisciplinary research project that is closely tied to U01 research. After preliminary online trainings are
completed and visas are obtained, each Fellow will travel to their US Faculty mentor’s laboratory for three
months of research training tailored for their project. After this training is complete the Fellows will return to
Mongolia and spend the next 12 months conducting their research project in Mongolia. In a capstone
experience Fellows will present their research to the External Advisory Committee at the Annual Mongolian
GEOHealth Hub Review. Afterwards they will return to their former employment but continue to work with their
Program Faculty mentors in publishing their work in international journals and in influencing Mongolian national
health policy. During the 15-months of formal training each Fellow will gain considerable training in conducting
laboratory assays, the responsible conduct of research, research reproducibility, human and animal subjects
research ethics, collecting field specimens. data analyses, delivering oral presentations, and in English
language scientific writing. The collective expertise of the interdisciplinary Program Faculty committed to this
Center will provide unique and valuable professional training for the Fellows and also greatly advance science
at participating Mongolian institutions."
10802319,"Title: Voltage imaging analysis of striatal network dynamics related to movement, Parkinson’s disease
and deep brain stimulation
Summary
 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) delivers high frequency electrical current stimulation through chronically
implanted electrodes. DBS has been FDA approved for managing several brain disorders, including Parkinson’s
disease (PD), epilepsy, essential tremor, and obsessive compulsive disorders. However, the therapeutic
mechanisms of DBS remain largely unknown. There are many intriguing hypothesis, but experimental evidence
has been limited. The increasing use of DBS for PD over the past 20 years has offered a unique opportunity to
record from various basal ganglia brain structures in patients, and accumulating evidence suggests that
exaggerated pathological local field potential (LFP) beta oscillations (~10-30Hz) in the cortical-basal ganglia
circuit are a signature of PD. Using exaggerated LFP beta oscillations recorded in STN as a target feature, a
recent study showed that closed-loop DBS could be more effective in alleviating akinesia in primate PD models,
highlighting the potential of using pathological beta oscillations as a biomarker for PD.
 PD is characterized by degeneration of SNpc dopamine neurons that project to the striatum. The fact that
DBS is effective at managing motor pathologies highlights that PD involves neural circuit deficits that can be
altered by electrical stimulation to achieve therapeutic effects. The central goal of this proposal is to study the
neural circuit dynamics related to PD, and the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS, using a novel single cell voltage
imaging technique that was recently developed in Dr. Han’s lab. Specifically, we will examine how individual
striatal neurons’ subthreshold membrane voltage and spiking patterns relate to bulk striatal LFP oscillations
during voluntary movement in healthy and dopamine-depleted PD conditions, and how DBS alters these
interactions. Such understanding will provide important insights into the relationship between individual neurons
subthreshold membrane voltage dynamics (a measure of synaptic inputs) and spiking outputs, and provide direct
experimental evidence linking pathological LFP oscillations with single neuron biophysics, and how DBS affects
these relationships. We believe that such insights will help establish oscillation based biomarkers for brain
disorders, and facilitate future DBS designs."

10802321,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project aims at developing, validating and using novel mapping approaches to enhance the understanding
of excitation dynamics in early atrial fibrillation (AF) to potentially improve its treatment. AF is a progressive
arrhythmia afflicting more than 2.5 million Americans and 33 million worldwide; it increases risks for morbidity
and mortality and is the leading cause of embolic stroke. For patients with AF, anti-arrhythmic drugs perform
poorly and ablation, with controversial success rate and long-term effects, is often the only therapy available. It
is generally accepted AF initiates as short paroxysmal episodes that get prolonged, more complex and more
challenging for therapy with time. Thus, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of the arrhythmia and
how to device better therapies for it at its very early stage are of paramount importance. It is also accepted that
the alterations promoting the onset and regulating the maintenance of fibrillation have significant regional as well
as inter-patient heterogeneity requiring extensive mapping. It is therefore the general objective of this proposal
to develop novel mapping approaches to improve characterization of mechanisms underlying the link between
atria-wide patterns of electrical activation initiating AF and the heterogeneous atrial substrate. The proposed
project will utilize detailed computer simulations and novel panoramic intracardiac optical mapping in isolated
sheep hearts, together with our new developments in singular value decomposition and reconstruction (SVDR)
of hierarchical energy modes, to test the general hypothesis that onset and cessation of highly dynamic patterns
of electrical activity during early AF can be predicted by the substrate heterogeneity and by local energy analysis
of the activity. Our specific aims are: (1) To demonstrate in computational models of the atria the mechanistic
links between transient activation patterns during early AF and the stationary energetic properties of the
substrate and activity. (2) To utilize a novel panoramic optical mapping and SVDR algorithms to demonstrate
the characteristics of dynamical activation patterns during initiation and early stabilization of sympathetic, vagal,
and stretched induced AF in the sheep isolated heart. (3) To demonstrate that SVDR and energy domain
parametrization of AF can localize targets for interventions to render the AF in the isolated sheep hearts non-
inducible. Accordingly, regions with maximal energy will be localized in the real-time across the entire atria and
their role in sustaining the AF will be tested by local and reversible cryo-ablation applications. Accomplishing our
aims will enhance understanding of early AF and provide solid new framework for mapping AF dynamics in
patients to potentially improve its therapy."

well-trained biomedical career scientists with the experience and skillsets to become leaders in the next gener-
ation of DDK researchers. Two senior and accomplished Mayo scientists with an extensive background in
graduate education and mentoring will co-direct this program centered upon four Mechanism-Centric Research
Communities in i) Bioengineering and Biophysical Analysis, ii) Cell-to-Cell Communication, iii) Genomic Regu-
lation, and iv) Intracellular Signaling, with 24 interdisciplinary faculty members and over $20 million in funding.
This core DDK faculty provides a robust infrastructure with a successful history of training career scientists in
discovery-based and translational biomedical research. These laboratories offer a rich mentoring and training
environment that is uniquely tailored to the individual student while also promoting collective experiences
across multiple disciplines. The program's Specific Aims focus on fundamental aspects of reproducible and
rigorous biomedical research that align with NIH/NIDDK priorities. These are to: i) Offer a solid foundation in
scientific reasoning, research design, rigor, quantitative experimental approaches and analysis of datasets,
with objective interpretation of results; ii) Foster broad multidisciplinary understanding combined with critical
independent thinking skills, while implementing the ability to identify outstanding biomedical questions and ini-
tiate new approaches to advance the field; iii) Develop effective oral and written communication skills across
diverse audiences; iv) Promote ethical conduct in biomedical research and team skills that facilitate collabora-
tive scientific research alongside colleagues while promoting an inclusive work environment; v) Provide the

 The main long-term goal of the UPRH U-RISE Program is to increase the pool of talented minority
undergraduates with the required academic preparation and research experience to be competitive to win
admission to top graduate programs, and complete a Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., or equivalent degree, in disciplines
relevant to biomedical research. We propose the following measurable objectives for the upcoming five-year
U-RISE grant period: a) 100% of our students will finish their B.S.; b) at least seventy percent (70%) of the
participating undergraduates in our U-RISE Program will enroll in graduate programs leading to a Ph.D. in the
biomedical sciences within three years of graduation; c) a publication rate of at least one research paper per
year in peer-review journals throughout the entire funding period of the proposal will be maintained, where one
of the authors is a U-RISE UPRH student. Based on the experience of having the MARC Program at UPRH
for 34 years, suggestions from previous Advisory Committees, feedback provided by former MARC students,
and an intensive evaluation scheme, our program will be designed to provide the student with the following
competencies, which we believe are crucial for a successful transition to a graduate program: intensive
research training, critical thinking development, communication skills, training in quantitative/computational
analysis, and preparation for entrance to graduate school. To accomplish this, our program proposes activities
organized in the following Program Components: the U-RISE Curriculum, Research Opportunities, Academic
and Career Advisement, Seminar and Guest Speaker Program, Workshops and other Developmental
Activities, Peer-mentorship among Trainees, and Community Outreach. The UPRH U-RISE Program
proposes to train twenty (12) undergraduate students per year for biomedical research careers. Our trainees
will participate in our program for two (2) years, beginning at the end of their sophomore year. Participants will
be tracked throughout their undergraduate work through an intensive evaluation plan. This plan will provide
feedback for constant upgrading of the program. After completing the UPRH U-RISE Program, our trainees
will have the required academic preparation and research experience to do graduate work in fields such as
Biochemistry, Biophysics, Microbiology, Cell Biology, Neuroscience, Cancer Biology, Organic Chemistry,
Developmental Biology, and other biomedical research areas."
10802358,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that leads to sickling of red blood cells and the
development of chronic hemolytic anemia. SCD patients have lower risk for HIV-1 infection, but its underlying
molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We recently showed that changes in iron metabolism leads to
upregulation of innate immune response and prevent ex vivo HIV-1 infection of PBMCs obtained from SCD
patients. Our working hypothesis is that hemolysis-mediated upregulation of ferroportin expression and iron
export in SCD leads to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. We further hypothesize that macrophage processing
of abnormal sickle hemoglobin leads to interferon-β production and stimulation of antiviral response. What is
yet unclear is whether SCD or sickle cell trait triggers an overall antiviral state or whether HIV-1 is controlled at
post infection stage. To answer these questions, we will investigate HIV-1+ SCD patients and cohort of HIV-1+
sickle cell trait individuals to include males and Africans. We will also utilize mouse model of SCD to analyze
EcoHIV-1 infection in vivo. In Specific Aim 1, we will analyze HIV-1 restriction in HIV-1+ SCD individuals.
We will analyze the effect of SCD on HIV-1 infection in SCD HIV-1+ patients recruited from Howard University
and Montefiore clinics. We will analyze their hematological and virological parameters and test host genes
expression using RNA-Seq analysis. We will analyze their HIV-1 phylogeny, HLA-B alleles and inflammation
markers. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the effect of sickle cell trait on HIV-1 infection in African
Americans and Africans and viral load in African Americans from WIHS, Multicenter Cohort AIDS Study
(MACS), and a Nigerian cohort. We will conduct multivariable analysis to determine the effect of the trait on
viral load, relationship to CD4/CD8 counts and levels of proteins involved in iron metabolism and HIV-1
restriction. We will also conduct a case control study to analyze HIV-1phylogeny and the effect of iron and
inflammation markers on HIV-1 progression. In Specific Aim 3, we will analyze molecular mechanisms of HIV-1
inhibition in SCD and sickle cell trait. We will analyze expression of host HIV-1 restriction factors in monocyte-
derived macrophages treated with HbSS and HbAS hemoglobin and test selected factors in ex vivo HIV-1
infection of PBMCs derived from SCD patients and HIV-1+ sickle cell trait participants from WIHS and MACS
cohorts. We will also test HIV-1 infection in SCD and trait mouse models using EcoHIV virus that infects mice
and leads to the latent HIV-1 infection in T cells and macrophages.The proposed research will elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in the settings of SCD and sickle cell trait, which could lead to novel
anti-HIV-1 therapeutics based on the concept of HIV-1 restriction mediated by hemolysis and interferon
induction by sickle cell hemoglobin."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of acquired neurological deficits in children. Mild TBI, or
concussion, is highly prevalent in adolescence, and is linked with short- and long-term cognitive deficits, chiefly
inattention. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is similarly prevalent in children and represents a
primary form of inattention that occurs even without a history of head injury. The phenotypic similarity between
primary ADHD vs long-term symptoms of inattention subsequent to concussion is both a diagnostic dilemma
and clinical window of opportunity into the mechanisms by which brain injury affects cognition. In line with this
framework, the goal of this K23 award is to provide the applicant with training necessary to identify distinct
signatures of brain activity in children with primary ADHD vs ADHD with a history of concussion, which will
motivate mechanism-specific treatments for these inattention symptoms. The proposed research leverages the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, which is the largest ever cohort of children with concussion
paired with detailed cognitive and functional MRI data, to achieve this goal. It capitalizes on the the superb
cognitive neuroscience and imaging expertise of the applicant's mentors and collaborators to achieve the
applicant’s short-term goals of training in cognitive assessment (Dr. Barch), TBI research (Dr. Brody), ADHD
research (Dr. Fair), task-based (stop signal, n-back) fMRI (Dr. Barch), resting state fMRI (Dr. Dosenbach), and
multivariate imaging statistics (Dr. Thompson). The proposed training will facilitate the applicant’s long-term
goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist in the field of cognitive neuroimaging. These training
goals will be advanced through the proposed research. First, the applicant will use multivariate fMRI methods
to detect distinct patterns of task-related brain activation (Aim 1a) and resting-state connectivity (1b) in children
with ADHD and a history of concussion, compared to controls and either condition alone. Then the applicant
will investigate the fMRI correlates of time since last concussion (Aim 2) using task-related and resting-state
fMRI. Finally, the applicant will perform exploratory analysis on the effects of prescription stimulant medications
on brain activity in these groups (Aim 3). Notably, the proposed methods and techniques can be extended to
answer many other outstanding questions about the intersection between neurological and cognitive disorders
in the ABCD and future imaging studies. With a research program that employs multiple converging techiques
to interrogate neural signatures related to concussion and its cognitive sequelae, the applicant will continue to
address research questions relevant to the NINDS throughout his independent career."

One Health research is a field of international health research which recognizes the complex interconnectedness
of human, animal, plant, microbial and environmental health. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to respond to
global health needs in the search for causes, prevention and response. Its importance has been experienced
globally with COVID-19, a viral disease devastating humans, involving animals, and linked to changes in
agricultural, social, environmental and travel practices. One Health research plays a key role in addressing
outbreaks, pandemics and the health implications of disasters, humanitarian crises and other emergencies, often
requiring research to be initiated urgently – and raising additional ethical challenges. As One Health research
increases, so does the need to address its ethical issues. One Health research often involves human subjects,
animals (domestic and wild), agricultural practices, cultural practices and environmental issues, all with distinct
ethical components. As reports and our team’s OHEARP survey have found, ethics review committees and
regulators are already over-burdened and poorly equipped to review and monitor One Health research. As Kenya
has received growing numbers of international research projects, the number of people trained in research
ethics, or available to conduct such training, has been inadequate. The goal of our MOHERE program is to

11179599,"Project Summary/Abstract
One Health research is a field of international health research which recognizes the complex interconnectedness
of human, animal, plant, microbial and environmental health. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to respond to
global health needs in the search for causes, prevention and response. Its importance has been experienced
globally with COVID-19, a viral disease devastating humans, involving animals, and linked to changes in
agricultural, social, environmental and travel practices. One Health research plays a key role in addressing
outbreaks, pandemics and the health implications of disasters, humanitarian crises and other emergencies, often
requiring research to be initiated urgently – and raising additional ethical challenges. As One Health research
increases, so does the need to address its ethical issues. One Health research often involves human subjects,
animals (domestic and wild), agricultural practices, cultural practices and environmental issues, all with distinct
ethical components. As reports and our team’s OHEARP survey have found, ethics review committees and
regulators are already over-burdened and poorly equipped to review and monitor One Health research. As Kenya
has received growing numbers of international research projects, the number of people trained in research
ethics, or available to conduct such training, has been inadequate. The goal of our MOHERE program is to
provide such training and hence build the research ethics capacity for Kenya’s growing international health
research, including One Health and emergency research. We will achieve that goal through two specific aims.

10800601,"ABSTRACT
Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is an essential cellular enzyme that catalyzes the formation of S-
adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal biological methyl donor. Mammals express MAT1A and MAT2A,
which encode for α1 and α2, respectively, with MAT1A expressed mainly in normal liver. Patients with alcohol-
associated liver disease (ALD) have decreased MAT1A expression and activity. In addition to the cytosol, we
showed MATα1 is also in the nucleus to modulate gene expression via epigenetics and as a transcription co-
factor. Our works from the past funding cycle showed MATα1 is also present in the mitochondrial matrix to
regulate mitochondrial function. MATα1 interacts with CYP2E1 leading to CYP2E1 R379 methylation and
proteasomal degradation. We further showed MATα1 mitochondrial targeting is impaired in the murine NIAAA
model of ALD and human ALD. This is due to activation of casein kinase 2 in ALD, which phosphorylates MATα1
at serine 114 and this allows peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) to bind and block
MATα1 mitochondrial targeting. Our unpublished data show that MATα1 is also hyper-sumoylated in ALD at K48
(K47 in human) and this prevents PIN1 binding but in return, PIN1 is required for MATα1 to be sumoylated.
Additionally, the same MATα1 post-translational modifications result in selective depletion of MATα1 nuclear
content. In ALD, there is also increased interaction of PIN1 with Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1), an oncoprotein that
exerts a negative reciprocal regulation with MAT1A. Indeed, FOXM1 expression is induced in ALD, treatment
with a small molecule inhibitor of FOXM1 and hepatocyte-specific Foxm1 knockout mice are protected from ALD.
This renewal application will allow us to define three novel intertwined areas linked to MATα1 and test the central
hypothesis that alcohol increases MATα1 sumoylation, phosphorylation, and interaction with PIN1,
leading to mitochondrial and nuclear MATα1 depletion that drives ALD in part through FOXM1. Altered
PIN1 interactome further contributes to this process. Here we follow up these novel findings in three specific
aims: 1) examine the mechanisms for lower nuclear MATα1 content in ALD and its consequences. We
will examine MATα1’s nuclear import and export and whether these processes are dysregulated in ALD, nuclear
MATα1’s influence on the epigenome and identify its target genes, and whether raising nuclear MATα1 will
protect from ALD. 2) examine the role of hepatocyte FOXM1 in ALD. We will define the FOXM1 phosphosites
and signaling event that leads to increased interaction with PIN1, whether this interaction is important in ALD.
We will also examine hepatocyte-derived FOXM1’s target genes in different liver cell populations. 3) examine
the role of PIN1 in ALD. We will define PIN1 interactome in normal liver vs. ALD, examine the efficacy of small
molecule inhibitors of PIN1-MATα1 interaction in ALD. Lastly, we will decipher the crosstalk between PIN1 and
sumoylation of MATα1. If successfully accomplished, they will advance our understanding of how nuclear
MATα1, FOXM1 and PIN1 impact ALD, and may provide novel therapeutic targets."
10800609,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The main goal of this proposal is to define the role of macrophage Nudix Hydrolase 21 (NUDT21, also
known as CFIm25) mediated alternative polyadenylation (APA) during acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is an inflammatory lung disease with high morbidity and mortality. While there is
currently no specific therapy available, finding novel approaches to prevent or treat ARDS would be of the
highest significance and impact.
Our preliminary studies suggest that NUDT21-mediated APA is implicated in ARDS. APA is a
post-transcriptional mechanism of RNA regulation that allows adding a poly(A) tail at different polyadenylation
sites (PAS), generating transcripts with variable 3' UTR lengths. Previous studies from our group and others
identified NUDT21 as a master regulator of APA whose suppression promotes 3' UTR shortening of target
genes. Transcripts with shortened 3' UTR bypass microRNA-mediated suppression and thus may increase
protein production. Our studies demonstrated that NUDT21 was downregulated in macrophages in both human
and mouse ARDS. NUDT21 depletion in macrophages led to 3'UTR shortening and increased protein
expression of genes involved in important proinflammatory pathways, and promoted cytokine releases.
Functional studies with myeloid-specific Nudt21 knockout (Nudt21f/f LysmCre) mice confirmed increased lung
inflammation and injury in these mice compared to LysmCre controls in murine ARDS models. At last, we
found that hypoxia represses NUDT21 expression in macrophages. Further screening of potential miRNAs
targeting NUDT21 indicated that miR-181a was induced under hypoxia and repressed NUDT21 expression in
macrophages. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that hypoxia-mediated NUDT21 repression in
macrophages exaggerates ARDS by promoting the expression of proinflammatory factors through
APA. We designed three Aims to test this hypothesis: Aim 1: Demonstrate the functional role of myeloid
NUDT21 in murine ARDS models. Aim 2: Determinethe mechanisms for NUDT21 repressionand assess their
potential as therapeutic targets in ARDS. Aim 3: Molecular investigation of the hypoxia/NUDT21/APA axis in
human ARDS lungs. Our study is significant because it will elucidate a novel mechanism for increased
inflammation that could contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS. Our innovations include demonstrating the
hypoxia/miR-181a/NUDT21/APA axis as a novel proinflammatory pathway in ARDS, new resources (e.g.,
Nudt21 knockout and overexpression mice, and lung and macrophage samples from ARDS patients), as well
as cutting-edge technologies including mass cytometry to quantitate cytokines and markers of inflammatory
cells and PolyAMiner bioinformatics algorithm for identifying APA genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data.
Ultimately, results from these studies will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this
deadly disease."

Despite 6-12% of women and men around the world suffering from infertility, the full ensemble of genes that
control human reproduction has not been fully characterized. In this study, the PI will study the genetic
background of Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (IHH), a rare neuroendocrine disorder caused by
defects in Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) neuronal signaling, that leads to delayed puberty and
infertility. The genetic etiology in 60% of IHH patients remains unknown. This missing heritability can be attributed
to poor characterization of elusive genetic variation such as copy number variants (CNVs) that are hard to
capture using traditional sequencing technologies, such as karyotypes and microarrays. Recent advantages in
next generation sequencing have allowed detection of smaller CNVs from exome sequencing (ES) data. In this
study, the PI will utilize such cutting edge CNV calling algorithms in a large cohort of IHH subjects (1,400) to
examine the contribution of CNVs to the missing heritability of IHH, understand the GnRH neuronal biology and
decipher the genetic control of rare and common reproductive disorders. The PI will explore the contribution of
CNVs to known and novel IHH genes and will utilize human phenotypes from the IHH patients and subjects
enrolled to the Mass General Brigham biobank (in whom CNVs from ES will be called) to determine the
consequences of CNVs in human disease expression. The PI will complete the proposed work under the
mentorship of Dr. Seminara, Dr. Talkowski and Dr. Balasubramanian. Dr. Seminara is the PI of a NICHD-
sponsored P50 National Center of Translational Research in Reproduction and Infertility (NCTRI) – Center for
Reproductive Medicine (CRM) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and will provide all available
resources (access to ES and phenotypic databases) for the successful completion of his research proposal as
well as direct mentorship to facilitate her transition to an independent career as a physician scientist. Dr.
Talkowski is the Director for the Center of Genomic Medicine (CGM) at MGH and has pioneered novel CNV
approaches. Under his guidance, the PI will analyze ES derived CNVs in IHH, control and biobank subjects. Dr.
Talkowski is also the Director of the Genomics Core that houses all the resources for the functional validation of
the novel genes that will emerge from the PI’s CNV analyses (IPSc derived GnRH cells). Finally, Dr.
Balasubramanian is the Assistant Director of the NCTRI-CRM with significant expertise in studying population
biobanks for human genetic investigations and will provide important guidance to the PI for the successful
completion of her proposal. In addition, the candidate will pursue formal coursework and regular engagement in
research meetings related to both reproductive endocrinology and genetics. This project will facilitate
development of skills in the areas of clinical investigation and human genetics and represents a comprehensive
plan to identify the role of CNVs in rare inherited neuroendocrine disorders of infertility, preparing the PI to apply
for a career development award to continue her training to become an independent clinical investigator."
10806934,"Metastatic disease is resistant to current therapies and remains the primary cause of cancer-related death.
Exploring the earliest events that promote circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to arrest on vessel wall at future
metastatic sites will expose new targets for rational prevention. In addition to biological factors, the physical
transport of CTCs and interactions with the microenvironment are regarded as key determinants of the metastatic
potential. Recent studies suggest that distant microenvironments are primed and ready to entrap CTCs, creating
a pre-metastatic niche for initiating metastasis. Our preliminary data shows a time- and organ-dependent
increase in platelet (PLT) accumulation and activation in vessels of both lung and liver in mice bearing primary
breast cancer, prior to spontaneous metastasis to these organs. We also found blood flow velocity was
heterogeneously reduced in capillaries of the liver before development of metastasis, indicating changes in flow
dynamics in vessels of the future metastatic sites may be involved in the process of initiating metastasis.
Whereas direct biological effects of PLT on cancer cells are well known, the roles of PLT in the development of
the pre-metastatic niche and the effects of these PLTs on biophysical transport mechanisms of CTCs have not
been reported. Our objective is to determine biophysical modulation of CTC transport by the pre-metastatic
niche initiated by PLTs using orthotropic mouse tumor models, novel microfluidics, and multiscale/multi-physics
computational transport models. Our hypotheses are: 1) there is an organ- and time-dependent
development/evolution of the pre-metastatic niche alters hydrodynamics for CTCs; 2) only the pre-metastatic
niche, which is sufficiently developed to alter these biophysical parameters, promotes arrest of CTCs on vessel
walls; and 3) modulation of PLT functionality by anti-PLT reagents affects biophysical roles of PLTs in the pre-
metastatic niche on CTC transport and the prospect of metastasis. The multiscale/multi-physics transport
approach will optimize parameterization of cancer metastasis based on experimental results in vivo and in vitro,
in order to characterize biophysical transport mechanisms of CTCs interacting with pre-metastatic niche.
Significance of this study will establish a scientific framework for understanding roles of the pre-metastatic niche
evolution initiated with PLTs in physical oncology for rational prevention of metastasis. Innovation of our
proposal is to elucidate unknown biophysical roles of the pre-metastatic niche on CTCs transport and to employ
computational oncophysical transport model incorporating multi-scale and multi-physics capabilities. To test our
hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims (SA): SA1: To understand the flow fundamentals in
vessels as a function of development/evolution of the pre-metastatic niche. SA2: To evaluate the biophysical
effect of accumulated and activated PLTs in the pre-metastatic niche on CTC transport in vessels. SA3: To
determine the effect of biophysical modulation of PLT functions on CTCs transport using anti-PLT reagents."
10794710,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly one in five U.S. adults have severe obesity (Body Mass Index ≥ 35 kg/m2), which is related to numerous
comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) reliably produces
substantial, durable weight loss and health improvements for the majority of patients with severe obesity.
However, weight regain over time is common and can develop into a serious complication marked by
reemergence of comorbidities and impaired physical and mental quality of life. This issue is compounded by a
lack of effective and accessible strategies to help MBS patients prevent weight regain and achieve lifelong
success. Indeed, current post-surgical guidelines advise that patients increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity
physical activity (MVPA) for weight loss maintenance and lifelong health, but most do not, and available
interventions do not address their reported low internal drive to engage in regular MVPA. Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based interventions are effective at promoting health behavior changes via
improved autonomous (or internal) motivation. ACT achieves this by clarifying personal values, linking
behavioral performance to those values, and increasing acceptance of contrary thoughts and emotions that act
as barriers to new behavior engagement. We pilot-tested a one-time, group-based ACT-based workshop
intervention (+ email feedback & support phone calls) to increase MVPA among low-active adults with obesity.
Participants on average achieved and maintained clinically important increases in MVPA and autonomous
motivation, and larger improvements in motivation were related to larger MVPA increases. These preliminary
results show potential for our approach to help MBS patients boost autonomous motivation for achieving
sustainable increases in MVPA. Further, our low-touch approach makes it ideal for reducing barriers to
participation and future application in MBS and other clinical settings. We now propose to build on our findings
by testing whether targeting MBS patients' autonomous motivation with ACT-based intervention produces
sustained increases in MVPA, and if such increases prevent weight regain after MBS. We will randomize 164
patients who are 10-20 months post-MBS and show relative weight stability to 12 months of: ACT targeting
autonomous motivation for MVPA; or contact-matched control (CON) providing PA-focused education and
prescribed goals. Both groups will: (1) receive two 2.5-hour group-based workshops (+ 2 booster sessions) via
Zoom video conferencing, email feedback, and telephone calls; and (2) be assessed at pre- and 3, 6, 12, and
18-months post-randomization. We will compare ACT and CON on changes in: 1) MVPA and weight regain
(primary outcomes) and 2) autonomous motivation and acceptance (secondary outcomes). We will also
explore mediators of the treatment effect on MVPA (motivation, acceptance) and weight regain (MVPA). If
successful, results could justify more robust physical activity guidelines and use of these strategies in clinical
practice to help motivate MBS patients to achieve sustainable increases in MVPA for weight regain prevention."

Preterm birth is a well-known determinant of poor child growth and development (CGAD). Premature
infants have a higher risk of infection, malnutrition, and developmental impairments. Additionally,
caregivers of preterm infants are at risk of developing mental health challenges, including depression,
anxiety, and stress and in low- and middle-income countries, where 81% of preterm births occurs,
caregivers frequently experience stigmatization leading to a loss of social support. These experiences have
been shown to negatively impact CGAD by altering bonding and caregiver responsiveness. Although
research shows that these factors influence CGAD through many pathways at many levels, each factor has
traditionally been studied independently, therefore, these pathways are inadequately understood. This
project aims to provide a clearer picture of these mechanisms and solutions to them through three main
aims. The first is to identify child, family, and social factors that mediate and modify the effect of
prematurity on CGAD. Caregivers of preterm infants will be recruited from well-child clinics at hospitals
in Ghana, a country with high rate of preterm birth and developmental disabilities. Factors such as infection,
malnutrition, feeding practices, parenting, maternal health, social stigma, and demographic characteristics
will be measured using routinely collected maternal and child health data and questionnaires completed by
caregivers. This data will be analyzed using path analysis, a statistical modeling technique that identifies
causal pathways among many variables, in order to determine how these factors, interact and influence each
other to determine CGAD. The second aim is to identify profiles of preterm and term babies who are at risk
for poor growth and development. Machine learning algorithms will be applied to the maternal and child
health data to identify the strongest predictors of growth and development. These predictors can be used to
develop clinical screening tools to identify highly at-risk infants. The third aim is to identify local,
caregiver-driven strategies that promote growth and development in preterm infants. This is based on
Positive Deviant Theory, which posits that even in difficult circumstances, some individuals have
uncommon but successful solutions. Caregivers whose preterm infants had high child development scores
will be recruited to participate in qualitative interviews to learn about the strategies they use to achieve
these positive outcomes. These results can be used to create an intervention for families of preterm infants
to improve child growth and development. A multidisciplinary team of researchers will supervise and
mentor graduate and undergraduate students from fields of computer science, health sciences, and child
development. In addition to global research experience, these students will gain leadership, teamwork, and
problem-solving skills that are invaluable to building future successful scientists."

Accumulating evidence shows that bisphenol A (BPA) affects not only the development and growth of
reproductive tissues, but also disrupts female meiosis. The interference of BPA with the meiotic process leads
to the formation of reproductive cells with an incorrect number of chromosomes, resulting in the inability to
conceive, pregnancy loss, and developmental disabilities in offspring. In recent years, increasing health concerns
led manufacturers to seek BPA alternatives, which has resulted in its replacement with bisphenol F (BPF) and
bisphenol S (BPS), for example, in some consumer products. However, numerous studies have indicated that
currently available bisphenol analogs resemble BPA in their ability to interfere with hormones and cause meiotic
errors. The long-term goal of the proposed collaborative research project is to understand the relationship
between bisphenol structure and meiotic fidelity. To this end, we aim to identify bisphenol analogs that pose low
or no risk to human reproductive health. This objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1)
Synthesis of a library of novel, structurally diverse bisphenol analogs via phenolic ring substitutions, which have
shown particular promise in mediating lower toxicity in studies involving tetramethylbisphenol F; and (2)
Identification of BPA analogs that pose low or no risk to meiosis using several C. elegans-based assays. These
assays will include the monitoring of C. elegans brood size, germ-cell apoptosis, embryonic lethality, and the
incidence of males that arise as the result of a meiotic error. Bisphenol candidates posing low or no risk to
meiosis will be further evaluated for their endocrine-disrupting properties using a validated human cell-based
assay. Understanding how the structure of bisphenols affect reproductive health could lead to the replacement
of this ubiquitous reproductive toxin with a safer alternative in consumer products. Furthermore, this innovative
proposal will significantly strengthen the research environment in the Department of Natural Sciences at the
Lawrence Technological University by providing our undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate
in a funded, multidisciplinary project with great societal relevance."
10796716,"Patients are living longer with metastatic lung cancer (i.e., metavivors) due to therapeutic advances, but face
significant challenges. Most metavivors will ultimately die of cancer and must navigate the duality of living while
dying. Unsurprisingly, metavivors endorse high psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, illness non-
acceptance), high symptom burden (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea, pain), and poor quality of life. Psychosocial
interventions can improve outcomes, but existing paradigms are not designed to help metavivors navigate the
emotional turbulence of living with metastatic disease. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) Skills Training is an
evidence-based treatment that teaches patients transdiagnostic, easy-to-use skills to both accept things as they
are (mindfulness, distress tolerance) and change things within their control (emotion regulation, interpersonal
effectiveness) to better navigate life challenges. However, DBT Skills Training has rarely been applied in patients
with chronic illness. We adapted DBT Skills Training (e.g., intervention dose, delivery, content) for patients living
with metastatic lung cancer to create LiveWell, an 8-session Skills Training protocol delivered one-on-one via
videoconference. Building on preliminary data and aligned with the ORBIT model for behavioral intervention
development, the first phase of this study (K99, Aim 1, 1 year) aims to iteratively refine LiveWell using 1)
qualitative exit interview data from a proof-of-concept study, 2) an advisory board of interested parties, 3) the
Dynamic Sustainability Framework from implementation science, and 4) user testing (n=10). The K99 phase will
produce a standardized protocol and procedures for the R00. The second, independent phase of the study (R00,
Aim 2, 3 years) will be a Phase IIB randomized pilot trial to test study feasibility, acceptability and outcome
patterns suggesting the efficacy of LiveWell compared to Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). Lung cancer metavivors
(n=80, >20% non-White) receiving care at NCI-designated centers (N=2 sites) and endorsing distress >3/10 will
be randomized to LiveWell or EUC. We hypothesize that: 1) LiveWell and EUC protocols and procedures will
show evidence of feasibility (accrual N=80/20 months, >80% adherence to interventions and assessments,
<20% attrition) and acceptability (>3/5 satisfaction study procedures, >3 mean intervention satisfaction
LiveWell)), and 2) LiveWell will improve quality of life (primary outcome) and reduce psychological distress
(depression, anxiety, illness acceptance) and symptom burden (fatigue, dyspnea, pain) (secondary outcomes)
from baseline to post-treatment compared to EUC. We will explore emotion regulation as a mechanism of
change. The objective of this Early K99/R00 is to provide Dr. Hyland with limited additional mentored training,
then facilitate her transition to an independent investigator working to develop, test, and implement novel
psychosocial interventions for cancer metavivors. Findings from this study will inform an R01 submission to
conduct a Phase III efficacy trial of LiveWell. If successful, LiveWell will improve metavivor quality of life and
provide a promising psychosocial intervention paradigm for other metavivors and patients with chronic illness."
10786213,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Solid organ transplantation (SOT) has transformed the survival and quality of life of patients with end-stage
organ failure. In 2019, 39,719 transplant surgeries were conducted in the US. However, allograft rejection
represents a significant cause of morbidity with an estimated 25-50% of transplant recipients experiencing some
of form of acute or chronic cellular rejection. Effective immunosuppression management is therefore essential to
improve organ transplant recipient outcomes. Clinically used immunosuppression regimens are overall effective
in reducing rejection, but come with potentially life threatening side effects including cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity
and diabetes.
 Regulatory T cell (Treg) infusion, alongside SOT, is an emerging strategy which focuses on rebalancing the
Treg ratio in the transplanted organ to prevent rejection or loss. However, developing effective therapeutics using
live cells necessitates means to determine their in vivo biodistribution, persistence, and efficacy after
administration. Clinicians do not know the fate of injected cells, thus, interpreting cases of non-responding
patients remains a barrier to wider use. We posit that developing imaging-guided biomarker-based therapeutic
approaches capable of visualizing Treg homing to tissue targets in vivo would be invaluable for assessing of
expected therapeutic activity following infusion.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only technique that is radiation-free, clinically translatable, and
enables direct visualization of labeled cells in vivo. Due to the clinical translation potential, MRI applications and
contrast agent development continue to see remarkable growth, especially in the cell tracking sphere. Labeling
generally occurs by co-incubation with iron oxide or fluorinated moieties in vitro, resulting in internalization of the
contrast agent. Safe and efficient labeling of non-phagocytic cell types, such as T cells, remains challenging and
often requires use of transfection agents, which are not U.S. FDA approved. Indeed, increased cell manipulations
exacerbate the risk of cell contamination, transformation and viability impairment.
 Here, we propose a fundamentally different approach. The microbeads used in the process of T cell
purification from human blood leukapheresis will directly label the target cells, producing proton contrast. This
new labeling approach, recently published and patented by our lab with CD25 microbeads, does not involve any
additional manipulation compared to clinical T cell isolation protocols. Our goal is to develop a one-stop-shop
Treg labeling protocol with cell sorting microbeads to track Treg distribution and homing for clinical applications.
If successful, this project will address the clinical bottleneck of in vivo cell surveillance, providing rapid and
quantitative methods to tailor specific treatment regimens to individual patients and improve overall outcomes
by preventing potentially life-threatening toxicities."
10789014,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Over 700,000 Americans live with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and more than 1 million are projected for
2030. Ninety percent of these patients depend on a functional vascular access for hemodialysis (HD) treatments.
However, the high rate of failure and complications of HD accesses is one of the most common causes of
morbidity in this vulnerable population. Approximately 70% of new ESKD patients initiate HD with a central
venous catheter (CVC), and most continue on a catheter for the next 6 months despite the high risk of life-
threatening bloodstream infections. One of the factors contributing to prolonged CVC use is the high rate of
arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure. Up to 50% of newly created AVFs fail to mature independently
due to significant stenoses (narrowing) in the venous segment. Interestingly, prior CVC use is significantly
associated with AVF maturation failure. In this proposal, I will challenge the high-risk, high-reward hypothesis
that AVF maturation failure after CVC use has a preventable immunological basis. Namely, this discovery and
mechanistic proposal aims to demonstrate the mechanistic link between CVC-derived molecular patterns,
exaggerated activation of neutrophils, and increased vascular damage in newly created fistulas. This proposal
is built on strong scientific premises, including the increased expression of at least 20 neutrophil enriched genes
in human veins that failed compared to veins that remodeled successfully after AVF creation. I hypothesize that
activation of the FPR1 receptor by catheter-derived bacterial peptides primes circulating neutrophils prior to AVF
creation, increases vascular infiltration, and causes an overresponse to postoperative vascular injury that
contributes to AVF failure. The proposal is organized in three complementary Specific Aims (SA). A discovery
SA will look for CVC-related changes in peripheral neutrophils of patients undergoing surgery for AVF creation
using single-cell RNA sequencing. A mechanistic SA will dissect the role of catheter derived N-formylated
peptides in neutrophil activation, and the consequences of this inflammatory pathway for postoperative AVF
remodeling using genetically modified animal models. Lastly, a pre-clinical translational SA will create a
relevant animal model that combines CVC insertion, biofilm formation, and AVF creation, and test the efficacy of
FPR1 activation blockers and neutrophil-depleting therapies to improve AVF remodeling. Considering the
frequent use of catheters in HD patients, results from this grant may not only be significant for AVF maturation
outcomes but also for other postsurgical scenarios such as transplant injury. From the career development
point of view, this application responds to Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-21-313, which aims at
facilitating the transition of new investigators of diverse and underrepresented backgrounds such as myself to
research independence. This proposal will support the development of a novel scientific niche in vascular access
research and will generate state-of-the-art data for competitive R01 applications."

Drinking use behaviors occur within a social-ecological environment where individuals are influenced by
personal, interpersonal, community, societal and political factors. Adolescence is a developmentally sensitive
time period where such factors may influence how frequently and consistently individuals use alcohol. While
drinking patterns for young people in the US tend to be typified by escalating frequency of consumption with
age, up until a decrease in use starting in the mid- to late-20s, drinking patterns across these ages are more
heterogeneous than the group average would suggest. Instead, subgroups of individuals may follow a subset
of drinking patterns with variations in the timing of drinking initiation, frequency of consumption, and binge
drinking behaviors. While prior research has documented heterogeneous drinking trajectories within samples
of young people in the US, no literature has modeled parallel trajectory groups incorporating both drinking
frequency and binge drinking simultaneously. Fewer have modeled how adolescent exposures and
experiences may influence trajectory membership. The proposed study advances our current understanding of
alcohol use trajectories by modeling parallel trajectories of alcohol use as well as binge drinking behaviors. For
aim 1, we will use dual trajectory Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) to identify and describe trajectories
of alcohol use and binge drinking from age 15 through 40 in a nationally representative sample of US
adolescents followed longitudinally into adulthood. In aim 2, we will use multinomial regression approaches to
investigate the independent and interactive influences of familial and environmental factors experienced in
adolescence on the identified individual alcohol use trajectories. A deeper understanding of long-term alcohol
use patterns and their influences into adulthood may inform future harm reduction messaging and
programming. In addition, examining dual (sometimes referred to as parallel process) trajectories between
frequency of drinking overall and binge drinking will help identify variations in drinking behaviors that may be
masked when looking at only one behavioral outcome in isolation."

Enteric diseases, including both acute and chronic diarrhea and constipation, are among the most common
ailments afflicting humans. Many enteric diseases, such C. difficile infection (CDI) and inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), are currently treated with systemically delivered biologics (e.g. bezlotoxumab for CDI and anti-
TNF antibodies for IBD). However, since the GI lumen is also home to trillions of microbes that may cause
sepsis if present in the blood, the GI tract has evolved over millions of years to strictly prohibit the diffusion of
large molecules, such as proteins and peptides, between the GI lumen and the blood circulation. Consequently,
the GI lumen is not readily accessible to systemically delivered biologics. In addition to reduced potency due to
poor access, the treatment of enteric diseases with systemically delivered biologics also suffers from additional
drug side effects due to the systemic exposure. We posit that orally delivered biologics, whose bailiwick is mostly
confined within the GI lumen, would likely be much better suited for treating enteric diseases due to both
increased local drug concentration and reduced systemic side effects. Unfortunately, since the primary function
of the GI tract is food digestion, conventional biologics are unlikely to be fully active in the protease-rich
environment of the GI lumen. In this project, we propose to develop both a protease-stable protein scaffold and
a delivery platform custom-made for biologics-mediated treatment of enteric diseases. These studies will exploit
an in vitro protein display technology recently developed in our lab that covalently links the displayed protein to
its coding cDNA in a one-pot reaction. We will first employ directed evolution to enhance the protease stability
of a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) (Aim 1). Concurrently, we will develop a probiotic yeast platform
for in situ delivery of protease-stable DARPins to the GI tract (Aim 2). Finally, using CDI as a model enteric
disease, we will perform preclinical development of a toxin-neutralizing and protease-stable DARPin and
evaluate its efficacy in vivo (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project should bring forth both a novel protease
stable protein scaffold and an efficient in situ protein delivery platform, and may greatly accelerate the
development of biologics against diverse enteric diseases."

Similar to skeletal muscle myofibers, cardiomyocytes in the heart appear to be particularly susceptible to
membrane instability and rupture during disease, in part because of their contractile status that produces
ongoing mechanical deformation. Mutations in genes that disrupt or weaken the membrane anchoring
proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) or the integrin adhesion network causes a wide range
of muscular dystrophies that also cause cardiomyopathy. We have shown that the thrombospondin gene
family (Thbs1-5) plays a critical role in membrane stability through both effects on the ER stress response
and secretory pathways, as well as controlling the integrin complexes present on the sarcolemma. In our
previous cycle of funding, we showed that overexpression of Thbs3 has a remarkable effect of reducing
sarcolemma stability in heart (opposite of Thbs4) by removing large arrays of integrin heterodimers from the
adhesion complexes, while Thbs3 KO mice have enhanced integrin membrane levels and are protected
from insults that would otherwise cause cardiomyopathy, like overexpression of Thbs4 that also increases
membrane stability by increasing membrane attachment protein complexes in the sarcolemma. However,
several critical mechanistic questions remain to be addressed in attempting to translate our findings into
therapeutic approaches. Here we propose the unifying hypothesis that the cardiac expressed Thbs proteins
primarily function from within the secretory pathway in mediating the stability, or recycling of membrane
attachment complexes, which has profound effects on sarcolemmal stability and healing dynamics within the
heart with both acute injury and chronic disease, which will suggest potential novel gene therapeutic
ventures for cardiomyopathy in heart failure or with muscular dystrophy. To interrogate this hypothesis, we
propose the following 2 Specific Aims: 1) Mechanistically define how Thbs3 and Thbs4 antithetically regulate
sarcolemmal stability through integrin processing for gene therapy application in cardiomyopathy and
muscular dystrophy. 2) Examine the molecular mechanism of dilated cardiomyopathy in a mouse model for
the Human THBS4 D717N variant. The goal will be to better understand human heart disease through the
Thbs gene family and how it regulates membrane stability and adhesion complex activity. Translational
implications are that a better understanding of these molecular mechanisms will suggest why humans with
mutations in Thbs4 show dilated cardiomyopathy and will suggest modified versions of Thbs4 to be used in
gene therapy approaches to treat muscular dystrophy, as well as a wide array of heart diseases in which the
membrane is weaker."
10794225,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Purinergic signaling plays fundamental roles in activities of the nervous system as diverse as neuroprotection,
synaptic transmission, nociception, inflammation, hearing, and taste. This process is initiated by releasing
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) across the membrane through either classic exocytosis or ATP-permeable
channels into the synaptic cleft, where the ATP binds downstream receptors on an adjacent cell. There are five
families of ATP release channels: connexins, pannexins, volume-regulated anion channels, maxi channels, and
calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHMs). Highly expressed in the brain and taste buds, CALHM channels
play essential roles in taste and neuron transmission, and their dysregulation has been associated with various
neurological disorders including Alzheimer disease, ischemic brain damage, and depression, making CALHM
channels important pharmacological targets.
The CALHM family consists of three members, CALHM1, 2, and 3. They are voltage-dependent, extracellular,
calcium-concentration-regulated, nonselective ion channels that are permeable to the signaling molecules ATP
and calcium. They are predicted to share membrane topology with connexins, pennexins, innexins and VRACs.
Functional studies provide a consensus view that CALHM1 forms a hexameric channel and that it forms only
hemichannels, but not gap junctions. CALHMs activity is modulated by a wide range of factors including
ruthenium red, Gd3+, and 2-APB. Although CALHMs are central to human physiology and are potential
therapeutic targets, there are no structures of this family. We do not understand, in molecular detail, how the
channel is activated or inhibited, or how it is modulated by small molecules binding at specific sites.
We have published strong evidence that CALHM2 is undecameric and exists as both hemichannels and gap
junctions in vitro. We have determined cryo-EM structures of human CALHM2 in the Ca2+-free open state, and
ruthenium red–bound inhibited state. These preliminary results provide not only the first atomic structures of a
CALHM family member, but also the first bona fide structure in an inhibited state, which has never been reported
for channels with similar topology including connexins, pannexins, innexins and VRACs. We observed a binding
site of ruthenium red that was completely unknown before. Building on this preliminary data, we propose to
continue the structural studies of CALHM2 and the other two family members, CALHM1 and CALHM3, combined
with complementary electrophysiology experiments and other functional approaches, to define the molecular
basis for a comprehensive gating mechanism and the molecular determinants and function of gap junction
formation, as well as their pharmacology. These advances will provide a solid foundation for developing new
drugs against neurodegenerative diseases and for a deeper understanding of the function of the ATP release
channel family and the gap junction family."

Cancer patients suffer from a multitude of debilitating symptoms associated with cancer and cancer treatment,
many of which are not relieved with prescription medications. In hopes of managing these symptoms, many
patients are turning to cannabis, with recent estimates of cannabis use among cancer patients ranging from
24-40%, primarily for physical and neuropsychiatric symptom relief, despite limited evidence of benefits and
uncertain risks. This is, in part, due to increased availability of cannabis as more states legalize use. The
expanding cannabis market, with varying regulations, limited product standards and few marketing restrictions,
has resulted in a marketplace filled with diverse product types (e.g., smoked cannabis, vapes, edibles, topicals)
with unpredictable cannabinoid concentrations, often exceeding that of therapeutic benefit (THC>15%). These
products are associated with acute intoxicating effects and long-term adverse effects. Furthermore, THC and
CBD, the primary cannabinoids, may be hepatotoxic, affect the metabolism of chemotherapy, and result in
drug interactions that could enhance chemotoxicity. Furthermore, cannabis’ immunosuppressive effects could
dampen immune responses and alter the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite this, patients
generally report that cannabis improves cancer-related symptoms. Current evidence for clinical benefits of
cannabis is mixed and often inconclusive, largely due to small sample sizes and/or cross-sectional data. To
better understand the benefits and risks of cannabis and cannabinoid use during cancer treatment, rigorous
longitudinal studies of patient cohorts that document details of cannabis use (i.e. product type, frequency,
cannabinoid ratios and potency, and patterns of use) are needed. We aim to achieve this goal by collaborating
with the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), a national network of
community oncology clinics. We will recruit a sample of 2000 newly diagnosed cancer patients with breast
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to assess the
benefits and risks of cannabis and cannabinoid use during treatment. Participants will complete monthly online
surveys for 12 months to assess cancer-related symptoms and severity, as well as detailed cannabis and
cannabinoid use. This will allow us to (1) describe the longitudinal patterns of use among adult cancer patients
during treatment and the effect of individual, clinical and community-level factors on these patterns, and (2)
determine the potential benefits and harms of use on cancer and treatment-related symptoms (e.g., nausea/
vomiting, anxiety, neuropathy). We will also assess potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects
of use with cancer treatment and changes in inflammatory and toxicity markers by collecting and analyzing
biospecimens in a subgroup of lung cancer patients. These data will provide a better understanding of the
temporal relationship between heterogeneous patterns of cannabis and cannabinoid use and cancer symptom
management; information that will contribute significantly to the design of future clinical trials in cancer care."

Prenatal exposure to viral or bacterial infections during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of
offspring neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Gestational biomarkers indicate
that the maternal immune response is the critical link between maternal infection and altered offspring
neurodevelopment. However, our ability to mitigate the deleterious impact of maternal infection on offspring
brain development is severely restricted by our limited mechanistic understanding of the underlying
neurobiological changes. Although preclinical rodent models have provided foundational evidence of
alterations in brain and behavioral development resulting from MIA exposure that mirror some changes in
human disorders, translational limitations provide a need to extend this program of research into a species
more closely related to humans. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) provide the closest model to human
development, sharing similarities in placental structure and pregnancy physiology, maternal-fetal interface,
gestational timeline, fetal and postnatal brain development, and complex social behavior and cognition. Our
laboratory has developed the first viral-mimic based NHP MIA model and demonstrated that MIA-exposed
NHPs exhibit alterations in brain and behavioral development implicating selective vulnerability to
socioemotional amygdala-prefrontal circuitry. Here we propose to leverage the entire biorepository of brain
tissue from previous NHP MIA models to determine, at the single cell level, the transcriptomic, cellular, and
connectomic alterations triggered by prenatal immune challenge. We have developed a novel pipeline for a
genes-to-circuitry approach that maximizes the yield of information from this precious tissue resource. Here,
we will target key brain regions in the amygdala-prefrontal network mediating socioemotional behaviors
implicated in human neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders at two critical age time points for the
pathophysiology of mental illness: juvenile (18 month) and adolescent (4 year). We will generate single-nuclei
transcriptomic profiles and quantify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in specific cell types (Aim 1),
spatially map and quantify high-priority transcripts in specific cell types and within-cell transcriptomic
colocalization (Aim 2), and map spatial distribution of synaptic composition, receptors, and direct inputs onto
specific cell types (Aim 3). These data, in combination with the extensive, longitudinal characterization of
offspring brain and behavioral development, build a comprehensive picture of MIA-induced changes in NHP
brain circuitry, toward the ultimate goal of identifying pathways of vulnerability and critical periods for novel,
targeted interventions and biotherapeutics to reduce the number of children adversely affected by prenatal
exposure to maternal infection."

Aphasia is a disorder marked by impairments in language and cognition. There is substantial variability in how
well people with aphasia (PWA) respond to treatment. This variability stems from aphasia treatment programs
primarily focusing on language, which is problematic since experimental models indicate that treatment
response in aphasia is predicted by pre-treatment language and cognitive measures. Aphasia treatment
programs therefore need to address PWA’s cognitive deficits in addition to their language deficits. Attention is
one aspect of cognition that is a prime target for aphasia treatment efforts because it is a foundational process
that supports other cognitive functions. Attention is also an important prognostic indicator of recovery from
aphasia. Yet, attention is rarely assessed in PWA due to a lack of appropriate assessment tools. The Attention
Network Test (ANT) is one promising tool because it can measure three types of attention (alerting, orienting,
executive control) using one task in 5-10 minutes. To date, the ANT has primarily been used to measure
visuospatial attention. However, it is more critical to assess auditory attention than visual attention in PWA
because the neural resources that support auditory attention are more left lateralized than visual attention,
meaning the left hemisphere strokes which cause aphasia, likely cause greater deficits in auditory attention
than visual attention. Auditory attention is also a stronger predictor of language abilities than visual attention.
While auditory versions of the ANT exist, our preliminary work indicates that they are inappropriate to use with
PWA and/or do not assess the aspects of auditory attention involved in language. In Aim 1, we will use the
knowledge gained from our preliminary work to further develop the auditory ANT for use with PWA. We will
optimize the auditory ANT by combining task relevant (information that needs to be consciously processed to
complete the task) and irrelevant information (conscious processing is not needed for task completion) into a
single stimulus. Our pilot data indicates that this approach is feasible, and that the proposed auditory ANT
measures alerting, orienting, and executive control as we expect in controls. In Aim 2, we will establish the
test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and internal consistency of the auditory ANT in PWA and controls. In Aim
3, we will predict PWA and controls’ language production and comprehension abilities from their alerting,
orienting, and executive control abilities. This proposal will produce a psychometrically sound assessment of
auditory attention for use with PWA. The results of this proposal also lay the foundation for future work that will
use this auditory ANT to predict language recovery in post-stroke aphasia."

More patients die from lung cancer than from any other cancer type each year in the United States. Moreover,
lung cancers with K-ras driver mutations are resistant to targeted therapies. Therefore, there is an unmet need
to find druggable targets downstream of K-ras. Tumor-promoting inflammation occurs frequently as a result of
K-ras mutations that activate the NF-κB pathway, the production of interleukin 6, and activation of its downstream
transcription factor STAT3. However, when we knock out STAT3 in tumor cells in mice, females have fewer
tumors, but males have more. This sex disparity is driven by overactivation of NF-κB in males, but in females,
estrogen signaling reduces NF-κB and tumor-promoting inflammation. This protective phenotype requires
estrogen receptors (ERs), nuclear hormone receptors that bind estrogen and interact with NF-κB. There are two
genes for ERs: ERα and ERβ. ERβ is the major ER isoform expressed in lung tissue, and ERα is mainly in
immune cells. Accordingly, I hypothesize that in the absence of STAT3 in the lung epithelium, ERα and ERβ
signaling is protective in K-ras mutant lung cancer by inhibiting NF-κB-driven pro-tumor inflammation. I have two
specific aims to test this hypothesis, one aim for each of the cellular compartments of interest: tumor cells and
myeloid cells. Aim 1: I will knock out ERβ in tumors to determine if it is required for cancer protection in females.
Aim 2: since ERα predominates in tumor-infiltrating myeloid immune cells, I will knock out ERα in myeloid cells
to determine if it is also required for cancer protection. Successful completion of these aims will further explain
the mechanism of ER-dependent lung cancer protection, with potential for estrogen and ERα/ERβ to play a novel
therapeutic role. Since clinical trials for STAT3 inhibitors have begun, it is important to understand the sex-
specific outcomes of targeting STAT3. Our results will guide clinicians to better personalize therapy by taking
sex hormones into account when treating patients. They will also shed light on the mechanism of resistance to
currently available immunotherapies and provide alternative modalities."
10932362,"SUMMARY – RESEARCH CAPACITY CORE
The RCMI Cancer and Health Disparities Research Center will enhance the quality and productivity of Xavier’s
basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research in the focus area of cancer and health disparities by
establishing a Research Capacity Core (RCC) that will have health informatics and data analytic resources,
shared instrumentation, therapeutic development core facilities, and cell and molecular biology facilities. The
proposed RCC build on the previous Research Infrastructure Core laboratories that served Xavier investigators
and helped enhanced the research capacity in the last U54 cycle. Based on the assessment of strengths and
weaknesses in the current research portfolio of Xavier investigators, the RCC will expand core resources and
implement new rules of prioritization, improved standard operation procedures, and more effective management
of core facilities including convergence of cross disciplinary expertise and cost recovery systems. To maximally
benefit Xavier investigators across all health-related research areas that are being pursued, the RCC proposes
the following specific aims to accomplish the overarching goal of enhancing Xavier’s research competitiveness.
In Aim 1, we will expand and sustain core facilities and resources for Xavier researchers. Addressing Xavier’s
research community needs and challenges, the RCC will expand a Data Science core resource to provide
services in big data analytics, social and behavioral data analysis, bioinformatics and multi-omics analysis,
biostatistics, statistical analysis that can be utilized to address health inequities. The RCC will maintain previously
established core resources including Major Instrumentation facilities, Therapeutic Development resources, and
Cell and Molecular Biology core facilities that have provided essential instrumental and technical support to
Xavier’s biomedical research projects. To sustain these core facilities and resources, the RCC will implement a
stratified and effective cost recovery program and leverage institutional commitment for the maintenance and
operation of the core facilities. In specific aim 2, we will enhance core services in research methodology,
specialized laboratory techniques, statistics, bioinformatics and health informatics. The RCC will expand the
faculty expertise group (FEG) to include two additional data scientists to support behavioral and clinical research
projects. The FEG will consist of senior faculty members with research expertise in experimental design and
research strategy on drug discovery and formulation, cell and molecular biology, mechanistic investigations, and
data processing using various bioinformatics and biostatistics tools, and analytical instrumentation. The
proposed RCC will further prioritize and streamline the services to better meet the needs of Xavier’s research
community. The RCC will have two core directors who will lead the faculty expertise group while also serving as
FEG members. The FEG will be charged with core management, service prioritization, and provision of
consulting services in research methodology development, specialized laboratory techniques, statistics,
bioinformatics and health informatics."
10802396,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced maternal age at the time of reproduction decreases offspring lifespan and health in a range of species,
including humans. The mechanisms controlling maternal age effects on offspring are unknown, however.
Mitochondria are prone to damage and dysfunction with age and are maternally inherited, suggesting they may
play a role in intergenerational maternal effects on offspring health. Our work shows that offspring from older
mothers have shorter lifespan, lower reproduction, decreased health, and altered behavior relative to young-
mother offspring. We found that these changes are associated with higher mtDNA per cell, more mitochondria,
larger mitochondria, decreased mitochondrial intermembrane area, lower oxidative potential, lower ATP content,
and altered reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Our results and the literature on mitochondria in aging led to
our hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction in advanced maternal age causes accumulation of dysfunctional
mitochondria in offspring through compensatory biogenesis and decreased autophagy during development. This
disrupts offspring mitochondrial function and mitochondrial-nuclear communication, leading to accelerated
offspring aging. The objective of this project is to understand the mitochondrial mechanisms by which maternal
age determines offspring aging. In this study, we will: (1) identify the maternal mitochondrial mechanisms that
trigger maternal age effects; (2) identify the developmental mechanisms causing accumulation of mtDNA and
damaged mitochondria in old-mother offspring; and (3) identify the offspring mitochondrial mechanisms involved
in negative maternal age effects and determine if these mechanisms are ROS-dependent. This work will be
accomplished using qPCR and RNA-Seq to quantify mtDNA and controls on metabolism, signaling, and
dynamics; imaging to quantify mitochondrial ultrastructure and mitophagy, and pharmacological and RNAi
manipulation of maternal and offspring mitochondria to test mechanisms. We will use biochemical, respirometry,
and imaging approaches to measure mitochondrial efficiency. Additional biochemical and imaging approaches
will be used to quantify ROS and cellular damage. We will use lifetable experiments to measure lifespan and
reproduction in response to maternal age or mechanistic tests. Studies will be on both female and male offspring.
Our study system is the rotifer Brachionus manjavacas—a short-lived, aquatic, microscopic invertebrate with
unique advantages as a model for investigating maternal age effects. Our approach will identify the cellular
mechanisms by which advanced maternal age causes accumulation of mtDNA and damaged mitochondria in
offspring; changes offspring mitochondrial dynamics, structure, and function; and decreases offspring fitness. If
successful, this research will advance the field by revealing drivers of accelerated aging in offspring due to
maternal age effects and by identifying mechanisms underlying a poorly understood cause of interindividual
variability in healthspan and lifespan. Our findings will have implications for understanding age-related changes
in female fertility and for identifying potential targets for treatment of age-related dysfunction."
10802397,"The current standard of care of surgery and radiochemotherapy for glioblastomas (GBM) is inadequate and has
not resulted in improved prognosis. Accumulating evidences show that the failure of using current chemo
(temozolomide, TMZ)- and radio- therapies to treat GBM and the resultant high tumor recurrence are attributed
to the presence of a small subpopulation of glioma stem cells (GSC), which is characterized by their stem cell-
like properties and aggressive behavior. Under hypoxic conditions, GSC increase the activation of several Notch
genes, which hold a prognostic implication, as upregulated Notch genes are associated with poor survival. Notch
signaling is highly active in GSC, inhibits differentiation, maintains stem-like properties, and, therefore, is
responsible for GBM tumorigenesis and stemness. Our project highlights transient receptor potential melastatin-
related-7 (TRPM7)’s role in Notch signaling and glioma treatment failure. TRPM7 encodes a Ca2+ permeable
nonselective cation channel fused with a serine/threonine kinase at its carboxyl terminus. Our group found that
the suppression of TRPM7 channels inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of malignant human gliomas,
indicating that TRPM7 channels may represent a novel and promising target for therapeutic intervention of
malignant glioma. Furthermore, the effect of TRPM7 on the proliferation and invasion of human glioma cell is
mediated by multiple mechanisms. TRPM7 regulates miR-28-5p expression, which suppresses cell proliferation
and invasion in glioma cells by targeting Ras-related protein Rap1b. In particular, our group found that TRPM7
channels regulate GSC growth and proliferation through STAT3 and Notch signaling pathways. In addition, the
preliminary data in this proposal show that decreased expression of TRPM7 is correlated with decreased active
Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) from the Notch1 receptor and reduced GSC marker CD133 expression in
the glioma cell lines/xenoline tested. Our results indicate that TRPM7 regulates the Notch pathway in most glioma
cell lines/xenoline despite the high heterogeneity and variations in glioma’s biological characteristics. In this
proposal, we hypothesize that TRPM7 molecular pathway is functionally connected to Notch-induced stemness,
and TRPM7 may be a novel GBM drug target. In this project, we will utilize patient-derived xenolines (PDX) that
closely mimics the biological and physiological features of in vivo real cells and tissues to test our hypothesis.
Aim 1: Determine the role of TRPM7 in the regulation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ homeostasis in GBM PDX and PDX-
GSC. Aim 2: Determine the role of the Notch signaling pathway regulated by TRPM7 in the progression of glioma
and maintenance of self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GSC using PDX and PDX-GSC. Aim 3: Investigate
whether targeting TRPM7 reduces tumor growth in mouse PDX glioma models and sensitizes tumor to TMZ-
mediated apoptosis. Accomplishing this study will delineate the molecular mechanisms of TRPM7 in the
development and progression of glioma tumorigenesis and stemness, as well as develop TRPM7 as a novel
drug target for glioma patients."
10802398,"Aging and injury are among the major global health problems and death due to injury
increases sharply with age. As hemorrhage accounts for almost half of all trauma-related deaths,
there is a need to develop methods to reduce the adverse effects of aging on injury to facilitate
healthy living. In this proposal, our objective is to establish that circulatory factors of juvenile origin
can improve outcome following injury in the mature and aged animals. The experiments proposed
in this project are based upon our finding that following hemorrhagic shock in a mouse model
(hemorrhagic shock injury; HI) juvenile mice have a survival advantage compared to adult mice.
We also found that EVs from the plasma of juvenile mice improved organ function and survival
following HI. Based upon these data our hypothesis is that plasma factors from juvenile mice can
restore mitochondrial function, alleviate oxidative stress and reduce organ dysfunction and death
in mature and old mice subjected to HI. We will test our hypothesis by determining the protective
effect of juvenile mice-derived EVs in mature and old mice and identify potential mechanisms by
which juvenile plasma factors exert salutary effect in mature and aged mice following HI. Using
5XFAD mice we will determine whether juvenile EVs can reduce pathology in Alzheimer’s
disease, an age associated neurodegenerative disease. Our goal is to develop methods to
revitalize the aging system by identifying molecular factors involved in maturational development.
We will use a combination of cell biological, biochemical and genomic tools and techniques to test
the hypothesis. We expect that our studies will result in the identification of juvenile protective
factors that can improve outcome following hemorrhagic shock. The proposed research is
relevant to the part of NIH’s mission pertaining to developing fundamental knowledge to
potentially help reduce the burdens of human disease. The outcome of this research will be
significant because the fundamental knowledge gained from this study is expected to advance
methods to promote healthy living."
10799814,"Abstract
 Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy (after non-Hodgkin lymphoma)
in the U.S. Over the past decade, despite the advent of novel therapies that has improved the life expectancy of
patients with MM, MM is still incurable. Patient outcome varies widely with overall survival (OS) ranging from
less than 1 year to greater than 10 years. The large variability of patient overall survival resulting from the high
heterogeneous microenvironment of MM heightens the needs of risk-adapted treatment for long-term control,
which are largely relied on accurate assessment of tumor evolution and survival prediction. The International
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guideline and several other different prognostic models have been used to
assess treatment outcomes. These systems utilize different subsets of laboratory values from clinic tests as
assessment criteria, which may not indicate the full extent of tumor burden. MRI is the gold standard imaging
modality for detection of bone marrow involvement. It provides global representation of the tumor burden, even
for patient with non-secretory or hypo-secretory MM. We hypothesize that integrating multimodal information
delivered by time serial noninvasive MR imaging and clinical tests will provide more robust and accurate
modeling of MM evolution during and after treatment, and thus can predict treatment outcomes more reliably at
an early time. Our goal is to develop a framework of decision support system (DSS) that integrates MR images
and clinical tests to assist physicians in making informed decisions on tailoring treatment for an individual MM
patient. The proposed study aims to (1) Investigate the effectiveness of MRI radiomic features in characterizing
MM infiltration and their correlations with treatment outcomes, (2) Investigate the circumstances how the
combination of MRI radiomics and clinical tests complements each other and is more powerful in early prediction
of treatment outcomes. To achieve these aims, we will retrospectively collect a large data set of MM cases with
baseline and follow-up MRI scans and clinical tests for development and validation of the DSS system. We will
utilize advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including recurrent neural networks and reinforcement
learning to train predictive models with time serial MRI and clinical data acquired at multiple time points, which
allows the trained models to be deployed flexibly to each individual time point for treatment assessment to
facilitate early prediction. Furthermore, these advanced AI techniques can learn intertemporal dependencies
from available data to compensate for the missing data or exams at single time points in serial exams which may
occur in real-world clinical situation. With a flexible modular architecture design of our DSS system, we will
investigate the inter- and intra-relationships between MRI and laboratory variables for better understanding of
their complementarity in characterizing tumor burden during MM treatment and their association with treatment
outcomes. As a final step, using an independent multi-institutional test set, we will validate the performance of
the developed DSS in predicting the recurrence risk at an early time point during treatment."
10815819,"Project Summary. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a behavioral disorder marked by self-starvation and fear of weight
gain. Weight restoration to a BMI of 19-21 remains the mainstay of treatment for severe AN despite relapse rates
in the first year of up to 50%. The mechanisms underlying these high relapse rates remain unknown. Meal-
associated anxiety is a striking feature in patients with AN. As the disorder develops, eating behaviors are in-
creasingly driven by what appears to be a conditioned avoidance of energy dense foods, known as fear foods,
suggesting that exposure-based approaches to treatment may help drive remission. However, in many intensive
treatment programs, tube feeding over meal-based nutrition is increasingly the approach. Thus, the need is
great for determining what mechanisms and approaches underly the successful treatment of AN and
what neurobehavioral factors render individuals responsive versus resistant to treatment. Research: Ex-
periments will address the extent to which habituation of learned aversions to fear foods following meal-based
exposure generalizes across similar types of foods (Aim 1). Task-based fMRI combined with this behavioral
approach will allow the determination of the neural substrates of habituated anxiety responses (Aim 2a). Finally,
a machine-learning approach will be used to predict anxiety ratings based on baseline neural activation and
identify individuals responsive vs resistant to treatment (Aim 2b). By demonstrating the significance of addressing
food-related anxiety as a primary treatment target and examining the neural circuitry activated by fear foods, this
project has potential to 1) alter how AN is treated across multiple levels of care and social eating settings, and
2) enhance understanding of the neurobiology that sustains treatment refractoriness. Career Development: The
training plan will provide the PI with a) clinically relevant training in the phenomenology of AN, clinical course,
and validated instruments used to assess eating disorders important to formulating clinically relevant hypotheses
and data interpretation, b) hands-on training in advanced statistical methods for fMRI data, c) opportunity to
integrate her training in factors that influence food choice with obtained results, and d) training in grant writing
and career development to launch an independent research career. Environment: Johns Hopkins is an excellent
environment for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and translational research in healthy and disease states and is
focused on mentoring junior faculty. The Johns Hopkins Hospital is ranked #1 in the nation for Psychiatry, with
the School of Medicine being the leading research medical institution in the United States and the Eating Disorder
Program nationally recognized as a leading program for eating disorder treatment. Career Goal: The proposed
research and training program is targeted to meet the PI's overall career goal of becoming an independent
academic researcher investigating the biological basis of eating disorders at a university setting by providing the
skills and pilot data necessary for larger R01 proposals to examine neural mechanisms underlying the driven
nature of eating disorder behaviors with the goal of improving existing treatments and personalizing care."

This is a competitive renewal of the “Minnesota Training Program in Virology” following a highly productive
funding period. Discoveries in virology research have led to many fundamental insights into molecular and
cellular processes of cells, basic mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenesis, and strategies for how host
cells respond to viral infection (i.e., virus-host interactions). Viruses and their capacity to cause serious
diseases and death have had a profound impact on the history of humanity and continually threaten global
health and economic stability. This training program utilizes 32 accomplished trainers, who are conducting
research on a wide variety of important viruses. The Institute for Molecular Virology (IMV) serves as the focal
point for virology research at University of Minnesota (UMN) and has championed virology research as a
critically important university investment at a time of declining resources. Such investment includes a 80,000-
square-foot, $63 million Microbiology Research Facility that opened in 2015 as well as $14 million for additional
research infrastructure in the Biomedical Discovery District in the past 8 years.
Key highlight's of the training activities of our program include implementation of foundational coursework in
virology as well as a wide-range of IMV-sponsored activities attended by both trainees and preceptors that
provide important intellectual, technical, and career development opportunities (i.e., weekly Virology Journal
Club, monthly IMV Research in Progress seminars, quarterly IMV Innovations in Virus Research Lecture
Series, annual UMN-Mayo Distinguished Lectures in Virology & Gene Therapy, the IMV Educational and
Career Development Series, the annual IMV Symposium, a collaborative `Wisc-e-sota' T32 symposium, and
annual sessions in Responsible Conduct in Research). Trainee participation in these training program activities
have fostered the exchange of ideas and stimulated collaborative projects. Oversight of trainee progress is
monitored on multiple levels, including yearly evaluations by the training program's executive committee.
Outstanding predoctoral trainees are attracted to the UMN. From this pool, outstanding predoctoral trainees
are recruited to trainer labs by the individual strength of each trainer's research program. Trainee recruitment is
enhanced by the breadth of career development opportunities provided through the IMV that include the
hosting of national and international virology meetings that brings students – including underrepresented
minority students – to our campus to develop long-lasting interactions with all members of our virology
research community. Despite being a relatively young training program, we have a strong record of training

The lens of the vertebrate eye becomes transparent by removing the nuclei and organelles of its
inner fiber cells. Remarkably, these fiber cells must stay alive and functional without the ability to
produce new proteins. Defects in fiber cell differentiation can contribute to lens cataract, the
leading cause of blindness worldwide. While much has been learned about the molecular
mechanisms that coordinate lens fiber cell development, there are likely many key players yet to
be discovered. Our laboratory uses the zebrafish as an efficient screening system to identify novel
genes playing a role in this process. We recently used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to show that
damaging the transcription factor gene, cebpg, and RNA-binding protein genes, csde1 and c1qbp,
leads to defects in lens development. Interestingly, in non-lens tissues these three genes play
roles that would be relevant to lens development, such as regulating autophagy, protein stability
and the stress response. We hypothesize that the protein products of these genes perform similar
roles in the lens. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will characterize the spatial expression of each gene
across the developing lens of wild-type fish using RNA-scope, which detects specific mRNA
molecules. We will also detail changes in nuclear and mitochondrial loss and the elongation of fiber
cells. These experiments will allow us to identify the aspects of differentiation altered by the loss of
each gene. Aim 2 of this proposal will use RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR to detail how the lens
transcriptome is altered in each mutant. This approach will allow us to determine if the expression
of known regulators of lens fiber cell differentiation mechanisms such as autophagy, denucleation
or stress response, are changing, which would implicate them as part of the same signaling
network as our mutated genes. The transcriptomic analysis will also identify new possible
regulators of lens development, which we can then screen with our CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our
laboratory is well placed to successfully conduct these proposed experiments, which will provide
undergraduate students with excellent training in modern molecular and developmental biology
techniques and bioinformatics analysis. Our findings will take advantage of the zebrafish lens
system to address broad questions about how cells remodel during tissue differentiation."

Many light-responsive systems have been produced via natural evolution, including opsins, and phytochromes,
while chemists have added to the list of light-responsive molecules for new tools. Scientists have embraced the
use of these light-responsive tools to construct new materials, and we’ve just scratched the surface of the
potential in this important field, particularly in the direction of making efficient red-to-near-infrared (red-to-NIR)
light-responsive groups. The promise of red-to-NIR light resides in deeper penetration depth, less scattering and
absorption by the sample, and less photodamage. Though approaches that use two-photon and lanthanide
nanoparticles exhibit promising progress in allowing red-to-NIR absorption, developing organic-based materials
that work under low power LED light is still challenging and such materials would expand the toolboxes and
facilitate addressing a number of urgent questions. The organic-based platforms will benefit the fundamental
understanding of chemical structure-to-property relationships, as well as impact many intriguing emerging
applications, such as precision drug delivery, neuron modulation, light-triggered reactions, and gene therapy
activation. Because of the much lower photon energy in the red-to-NIR region compared with UV and blue light,
efficient red-to-NIR responsive is still challenging. This proposal aims to develop novel boron-dipyrromethene
(BODIPY) based photo-uncaging groups that build upon weak covalent N-O bond. In particular, the weak
dissociation energy of N-O permits the cleavage after absorbing low energy red-to-NIR photon, which is ideal for
biological and biomedical applications. By varying and modifying the chemical structures, we intend to increase
photo-uncaging efficiency by rigidifying the structure and for the first time facilitate dual cargo release from
BODIPY. After conjugating with a cancer targeting unit, biomedical applications of these novel photo-uncaging
materials will be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in light-triggered drug delivery. Overall, the capability of efficient
photo-uncaging in the red-to-NIR window will support more advanced experimental designs, and the
convergence of basic research with applications will contribute to expanding knowledge while benefiting
undergraduate researchers for broad impact."

On a population level, digital mental health interventions effectively reduce depression and anxiety symptoms.
However, middle-aged and older adults with depression and/or anxiety and coexisting chronic pain have not
been adequately represented in digital mental health studies and are a significant population because: 1)
chronic pain reduces the effectiveness of stand-alone mental health treatment unless a person’s pain is
simultaneously addressed; 2) the prevalence of chronic pain increases with age; 3) physical and mental health
related disability in these age groups have unique downstream effects (lost workforce, effects on dependent
children, strain on caregiver availability); and 4) use of technology in these age groups is widespread and
growing, but these users have unique digital health needs and preferences. This proposal is a partnership
between Washington University and Wysa, an established mental health app company that delivers cognitive
behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools using chatbot technology and human coaches. Wysa
has developed an app specifically for people with mental illness and coexisting chronic pain (Wysa for Chronic
Pain (WCP)) which addresses depression and anxiety via the intermediate mechanisms of behavioral
activation, pain acceptance, and sleep quality. However, the app is not yet designed to meet the usability
needs of middle-aged and older adults with chronic pain. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) refine an
established digital mental health intervention (WCP) for middle-aged and older adults with depression and/or
anxiety and coexisting chronic pain, and 2) determine its effectiveness. The central hypothesis is that
incorporating just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and other usability-related adaptations will improve
app engagement and, subsequently, depression and anxiety symptoms in this target population. Using a
human-centered design approach, the Behavioral Intervention Technology (BIT) model will be leveraged to link
established behavioral change theory with technology-related usability and engagement factors. Study
activities will follow the Discover, Design / Build, and Test (DDBT) framework. Aim 1 is to identify stakeholder-
informed contextual determinants of engagement with WCP by the target population. Members of the target
population with varying levels of technological literacy will participate in semi-structured interviews and usability
testing. Next, in a series of micro-randomized trials, adaptations designed to increase engagement with WCP
(e.g., JITAIs) will be created, tested, and iteratively refined (Aim 2). Finally, in a pragmatic randomized clinical
trial including 4,000 commercial Wysa users, the real-world effectiveness of the package of adaptations to
improve depression and anxiety symptoms within 12 weeks will be determined in a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-
implementation study (Aim 3). This proposal responds to PAR-22-154’s call to leverage an existing partnership
between WU and a theory-driven, well-established digital health platform (Wysa) to rapidly develop and test
JITAIs and their effect on digital engagement in people with clinically significant functional impairment."

Flaviviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause epidemics of debilitating human disease on
a global scale. The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause up to ~100 million infections per year including
life-threatening shock syndrome. Zika virus (ZIKV) is linked to microcephaly and congenital malformations. Tick-
borne flaviviruses (TBFV) are emergent threats that cause encephalitis, long-term neurological sequelae, and
death. No specific therapy is available for any flavivirus. Flaviviruses adopt ensembles of structures in which
certain antibody epitopes are exposed or hidden. Elucidating how antibodies recognize different structural
ensembles of flavivirus virions can enhance our understanding of their functional properties including neutralizing
activity. In this competitive renewal application, our long-standing collaborative team (Diamond, Kuhn, Fremont,
Crowe, and Pierson) proposes to continue studying structural mechanisms of antibody recognition and
neutralization of flaviviruses. We will define the functional properties of protective antibodies that neutralize
DENV and ZIKV in a conformationally-restricted manner. We will use these antibodies to probe the spectrum of
structures sampled by flaviviruses and how this influences epitope exposure. We also will perform new
campaigns to identify neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV and the distantly-related tick-borne flaviviruses that
recognize quaternary epitopes. We will use this information to engineer ZIKV subviral particles (prM-E; SVPs)
that optimally enable binding of neutralizing antibodies including those quaternary epitopes spanning dimer rafts.
Genetically modified ZIKV SVPs will be tested for improved immunogenicity and protection in mice. Overall, our
experiments will provide new insight into the dynamic states of flaviviruses and the nature of accessible
neutralizing antibody epitopes. These studies may facilitate the generation of novel sculpted antigens and
immunogens with improved capacity to detect and elicit specific protective antibody responses against DENV,
ZIKV, and likely other emerging flaviviruses."
10871823,"Metabolic disorders, such as obesity, are associated with adipose tissue hypoxia, inflammation and fibrosis,
and impaired lipid uptake, causing ectopic lipid uptake other organs, such as the liver. Furthermore, the secreted
adipokine profile changes dramatically, with impaired secretion of antifibrotic factors (e.g. adiponectin), and
elevated release of profibrotic adipokines (e.g. endotrophin, leptin). This alteration in the secretome negatively
affects other organs, elevating the risk of metabolic diseases such as diabetes. Therefore, adipose tissue
dysfunction is a crucial element in the development and progression of metabolic disease.
 Our previous work, focused on the antifibrotic role of the hormone relaxin, established that relaxin, through its
receptor RXFP1, reduced established hepatic fibrosis in mice. We discovered that one mechanism for relaxin’s
actions is through selective activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). RXFP1-knockout
mice develop age-related fibrosis in many tissues, but no studies had been conducted in adipose tissue. Our
recent experiments revealed that RXFP1-knockout mice developed age-related fibrosis in the visceral,
subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue, and have increased inflammation and decreased serum adiponectin
levels. Furthermore, we have established for the first time that RXFP1 is expressed by the adipose tissue
macrophages. Nothing is known about the mechanisms by which relaxin protects against adipose tissue fibrosis
or the impairments in function, or in alterations in adipose tissue secretion. Given the importance of adipose
tissue functioning in the maintenance of metabolism, and the importance of its secretome in affecting other
organs, targeting the relaxin pathway represents a novel approach to treating metabolic disease characterized
by adipose tissue dysfunction.
 Our long-term goal is to uncover biochemical mechanisms underlying metabolic disease in order to develop
effective treatments. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that relaxin regulates both adipose tissue and
liver function and thereby promotes normal functioning. This hypothesis is based on the new finding that relaxin
plays a role in adipose fibrosis and function, and our previous findings implicating relaxin in liver fibrosis and
regeneration. The rationale for the proposed studies is that understanding the mechanisms for relaxin’s effects
in these tissues will lead to development of specific targets for treatment. Our experience in endocrinology and
liver disease models, and nanoparticle development, will provide a conducive research environment to
successful completion of the proposed studies. We propose three Specific Aims:
1. Identify the mechanisms for the antifibrotic effects of relaxin in adipose tissue.
2. Determine the effect of the relaxin pathway on the adipose tissue secretome and interorgan signaling to the
liver.
3. Develop relaxin receptor-targeting nanoparticles on adipose tissue fibrosis in vivo.
 In Aim 1, we will utilize conditional RXFP1 knockout mice with conjugated linoleic or diet-induced obesity
models to determine the roles of RXFP1 in different adipose tissue cells and their signaling pathways. In Aim 2,
we will conduct proteomics studies to distinguish between secreted factors from conditional RXFP1 knockout
mice. In Aim 3, we will develop adipose tissue-targeting nanoparticles to deliver relaxin and selective PPARγ
agonists for treatment of adipose tissue dysfunction. Successful completion of these Aims will provide critical
insights into the mechanisms regulating adipose tissue fibrosis and function, and will test a new avenue for
treatment. This would provide the potential to combat the current increase in obesity-related diseases and
comorbidities, which is a major issue not only in the population at-large, but particularly in the veteran population."

Host-microbial interactions are a critical determinant of health. The gastrointestinal tract provides
several overlapping mechanisms that function together to prevent entry of pathogens into the body.
These protective mechanisms are provided through the coordinated of intestinal epithelial cells and
immune cells in the lamina propria. While the specialized sensory nociceptive neurons that detect
noxious stimuli such as pathogens, or the resulting host tissue damage are known to control immune
function in the skin and lung, the contribution of these neurons to intestinal mucosal immunity is not
known.
Building on our preliminary data, the overall goals of this project are to precisely determine the role of
sensory nociceptive neurons in the neuro-immune communication that limits enteric bacterial infection.
This will be achieved by selective ablation of sensory neurons, and experiments to determine the source
of SP and the targeted cells (SA1). How an enteric bacterial pathogen induces nociceptive activation in
vitro and in vivo (SA2). Mechanistic understanding of the immunological effect of sensory neurons
during enteric infection will be attained. Specifically, how nociceptor ablation impinges on dendritic cell
migration, chemokine production, and adhesion molecule expression will be determined (SA3).
Together, these proposed studies will decipher the contribution of sensory afferent nociceptive neurons
to mucosal host defense during enteric bacterial infection."

health care settings, to independently develop and test innovative interventions for heart failure (HF)
management that are effective and scalable, as well as improve care for HF patients. The K23 will provide her
the support necessary to acquire critical skills in four key career development areas: 1) enhance expertise in
HF symptoms and self-management based on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data; 2) develop expertise in
clinical trial design and implementation for the home-based symptom management intervention testing; 3)
acquire further professional development and leadership skills; and 4) obtain skills in developing and adapting
technology-aided interventions (i.e., app-based platform). To achieve her goals, Dr. Kang has assembled an
interdisciplinary mentoring team comprised of Drs. Kathi Mooney (Primary Mentor), an internationally
recognized expert in oncology symptom management using telephone-enabled interventions; Josef Stehlik
(Co-Mentor), an experienced cardiologist with an independent research career focused on HF treatments; and
Gary Donaldson (Advisor), an expert in multivariate longitudinal statistical analyses.
 Keeping HF patients at home with a low symptom burden after hospital discharge is challenging. Evidence
shows that delay in HF symptom recognition and poor self-management are associated with unplanned
emergency department visits and rehospitalizations. Clinical trials aimed at preventing rehospitalization using
telemonitoring have shown limited utility suggesting that monitoring physical changes alone may not be
sufficient to maintain stability of HF patients at home. A recent cancer study has demonstrated that patients
receiving cancer chemotherapy achieved a 40% reduction in symptoms using Symptom Care at Home (SCH),
a computer-interface telephonic interactive voice response system pairing patient-reported symptoms with
automated real-time, self-management coaching. While a few HF studies have used interventions that
monitored symptoms, no studies have tested a system that monitors and provides real-time, self-management
coaching tailored to specific PRO. Dr. Kang’s objective is to pilot an adaption of the SCH system to HF
resulting in preliminary data to support a fully-powered randomized control trial to test an adapted SCH-HF
system that could be widely disseminated. She proposes the following Specific Aims over two-parts: Aim 1]
Tailor the real-time self-management coaching system to integrate HF symptom monitoring and self-
management coaching into the SCH-HF system; and Aim 2] Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)
to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the SCH-HF system. The proposed research
is significant because it expands our understanding into HF symptom monitoring and management using PRO
in the home setting. The proposal is innovative because it integrates HF clinician and patient perspectives to
develop a daily home monitoring and real-time self-management coaching system."

High prevalence rates of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (5-11% of children 4-17 years),
combined with its high societal cost, strong persistence and pernicious effects on quality of life, warrant continued
efforts to understand its underlying neural mechanisms and find efficacious treatments. Clinical heterogeneity is
a major challenge, likely related to multiple causal paths, and contributes to variability in clinical presentation,
underlying neural mechanisms, and treatment response. Although psychostimulants are the gold standard of
treatment for ADHD, problems with suboptimal response, adverse side effects and non-compliance occur for a
significant minority of those with ADHD. As a result, there is a critical need for empirically supported non-
pharmacological interventions for ADHD. In addition, a reliable method for predicting response to treatment
interventions in ADHD (and psychiatry in general), both medication and non-pharmacological approaches alike,
remains elusive. This inability to prospectively predict whether a treatment approach will be effective for a given
individual is costly and time consuming for professionals and patients, and often inconclusive due to
disagreement between informants. In this project, we will conduct a large, multisite randomized clinical trial to
test the efficacy of external trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS), a novel, minimal risk, non-invasive
neuromodulation treatment, for ADHD in children ages 7-12 years old (N=180). This high impact project will
contribute significantly to the literature for empirically-supported nonpharmacological interventions for ADHD,
identify underlying neural mechanisms, and test clinically useful behavioral and cognitive predictors of treatment
response. Confirming the efficacy of TNS for ADHD could provide millions of families a viable non-
pharmacological treatment option, and in some cases, as first-line treatment strategy for patients with ADHD, if
supported by this research. The validation of a behavioral profile that is significantly predictive of treatment
response will make identification of patients appropriate for TNS treatment simple and extremely cost effective
as well as enhance dissemination of treatment into the community. This proposal is consistent with several NIMH
priorities, including the development of innovative interventions, assessment of the mechanisms of action of
efficacious interventions in the brain and identification of behavioral and cognitive characteristics to guide
treatment approaches."

Large-scale reference datasets of genomic variation have both provided population-level allele frequency
information that is a critical component of variant interpretation in diagnostic settings, and enabled the
identification of genomic sequences under severe selective constraint (i.e. intolerant of genetic changes). We
have previously demonstrated that gene-level constraint metrics aid in disease gene discovery efforts, improve
variant interpretation, and highlight critical biological pathways. However, substantial gaps in our ability to
interpret genomic variation and predict its impact on biological processes remain, and hamper our ability to use
genetics to guide clinical care. Particularly for missense variation, there are numerous orthogonal pieces of
information that could be used to identify the most constrained residues. Here, we propose to leverage human
genomic data sets of unprecedented scale (>700,000 exomes at the outset of our project and over 3,000,000 by
the end of the funding period) and to expand our previous constraint work in three different directions. We will
incorporate functional (e.g., sites of post-translational modification) and structural (e.g., three-dimensional
protein structures) information in our evaluation of selective constraint (AIM 1). We will then investigate how
these signals of selective constraint are shared across protein complexes, broader molecular networks created
from proteomics data, and specifically at the interfaces of protein-protein interactions (AIM 2). Finally, we will
search for evidence of significant differences in constraint across diverse ancestral groups, which is made
possible by the increasingly large and diverse genomic datasets being generated by our group and others (AIM
3). All of our results will be widely and openly shared with the research and clinical communities. These aims
are poised to improve our ability to identify genomic variation under severe purifying selection, and thereby our
methods for variant prioritization and applications to gene discovery efforts."

Human listeners can perceive the locations of concurrent sound sources in the surrounding environment.
The localization is based on a variety of sound cues, which vary with sound locations and frequencies.
Perception of speech is often improved when speech and background noise come from different spatial
locations, because the brain has the ability to spatially separate sound sources. However, those spatial
cues are largely compromised in hearing devices. The goal of the proposed study is to involve
undergraduate students in the development of a binaural system that could provide spatial sensitivity to
hearing devices, so that the user can localize multiple sound sources and selectively amplify or attenuate
certain sound sources. The proposed algorithm for source localization is based on the fact that speech, as
well as a variety of daily signals, is sporadic in a two-dimensional time-frequency domain. By examining the
spatial features for each time-frequency point, we can decide which sound source it belongs to and can thus
decide whether or not to keep it. The first aim of the proposed study is to build a system that simultaneously
decodes sound locations along the horizontal and vertical axes. The potential user of the system will be
provided with a spatial map showing all the available sound sources with their locations. Undergraduate
students will form three groups to work on the construction of the system and learn some basic simulation
skills. Next, the user will be able to select certain sound sources to be removed or kept. Those time-
frequency points that have been previously classified as unwanted sources will thus be eliminated. Then the
modified time-frequency signal can be transformed back into the time domain to reconstruct the sound
waveform that contains mainly the sound of interests. Undergraduate students will run psychophysical
experiments to measure speech intelligibility from normal-hearing listeners to examine if the modified sound
is more intelligible than the original sound of mixtures. In summary, the ultimate goal is to develop a real-
time binaural-hearing system to perform sound localization and speech separation. The proposed project
serves as the foundation for applying the algorithms to sound devices for hearing-impaired listeners in the
future. It agrees with the mission of NIDCD in assisting people with hearing impairment and communication
disorders."

 The expression level of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver is a major determinant of an individual’s
lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although SREBP signaling plays an important
role in LDLR gene regulation, it is highly likely that other transcription factors bind to noncoding cis-regulatory
elements to further modulate LDLR expression. In particular, several common genetic variants within a ~20 kb
interval near the LDLR transcription start site are each strongly associated with LDL cholesterol and ASCVD
risk in human genome-wide association studies. Since many of these variants are co-inherited, however, it is
unclear which are causal for an alteration in LDLR gene expression. In preliminary studies, we have performed
a high-throughput CRISPR screen that revealed a strong functional influence on LDLR expression for a ~0.6
kb region within the first intron of LDLR, with minimal effect observed for the remainder of the ~20 kb GWAS-
associated interval. This region furthermore exhibits biochemical features of enhancer activity, an enrichment
in transcription factor binding motifs, and a high degree of evolutionary conservation among vertebrates. In this
proposal, we seek to build upon this discovery to test our central hypothesis that an enhancer in the first intron
of LDLR modulates its expression and the risk of ASCVD. In Aim 1, we will fine map the activity of the LDLR
enhancer and identify the transcription factors that govern its effect. In Aim 2, we will generate mice with
deletion of the first intronic Ldlr enhancer or its replacement with the homologous human sequence to establish
its physiologic significance to lipoprotein metabolism in vivo. In Aim 3, we will engineer a synthetic version of
the LDLR enhancer with optimized activity as a potential target for therapeutic genome editing. Together this
work will clarify the fundamental biology of LDLR gene regulation and lay the groundwork for the long-term
development of a novel genome editing strategy to prevent and treat ASCVD."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with the loss of dopamine
producing neurons and the accumulation of protein aggregates rich in α-synuclein (Lewy bodies). While the
causes of PD are not fully known, rare families with monogenic forms provide translatable targets and the models
in which to test novel therapeutic strategies. For example, α-synuclein (SNCA) was discovered to be the major
protein constituent of Lewy bodies only after the gene encoding it was linked to familial PD. Our discovery of
SNCA multiplications subsequently provided the rationale and models to develop multiple approaches to lower
αSyn expression that are currently in clinical trials. In 2014, we genetically linked a missense mutation (p.N855S)
in DNAJC13 (encoding receptor-mediated endocytosis-8; RME-8) to late-onset autosomal-dominant
parkinsonism in multi-incident Mennonite kindreds (RME-8 PD). Affected family members had post-mortem Lewy
pathology rich in α-synuclein (αSyn) and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SNpc). RME-8 is a DNAJ-domain-
containing protein that, together with heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), stimulates: 1) the refolding of misfolded
proteins and; 2) clathrin removal from vesicles. Hence, loss of RME-8 leads to an accumulation of clathrin coated
vesicles, hyper extended membrane tubules and the aggregation of cargos. Given this background, we
developed a Dnajc13 p. N860S knock-in (DKIHet; corresponding to human p. N855S mutation) mouse model.
Preliminary studies in DKIHet brain at 3 months of age reveal the RME-8 mutation: 1) increases soluble monomeric
αSyn and clathrin coated intermediates; 2) causes synaptic delay following repetitive stimulation, and; 3) impairs
movement initiation (resulting in freezing) in open field behavior. The phenotypes DKIHet confers are consistent
with a pathologic gain of function and reminiscent of a ‘synaptopathy. In this proposal we aim to more fully
characterize the DKIHet model with respect to mutant and wildtype RME-8 protein-binding in synaptosomes from
microdissected striatum. We will more fully characterize differences in αSyn biology, including phosphorylated
and higher molecular weight species. We will also look at the mutation’s impact on dopaminergic function,
including biochemical, physiologic and morphologic assessments. Lastly, given RME-8 is also an interferon-
responsive gene we will explore neuroimmune biology and focus on microglial pruning of dopaminergic
terminals. Completion of these experiments will define the biologic role of DNAJC13 p.N855S, highlight its
mechanism of action in disease pathogenesis, and demonstrate the utility of DKIHet mice."

 Interstitial Telomere Sequences (ITS tracts) are degenerate telomere repeat tracts found on metazoan
chromosome arms whose functional significance is not known. We propose to develop a new paradigm in the
field of telomere biology, by demonstrating a telomere binding protein in somatic cells regulates a suite of
stress response and longevity genes that possess introns with ITS tracts. We discovered that ITS tracts are
enriched in the introns of C. elegans genes, and this is also true in humans. We identified hundreds of C.
elegans genes with ITS tracts that are bound by a telomere binding protein. The vast majority of these genes
are upregulated in response to environmental stresses and in mutants that are long-lived and stress resistant.
We discovered environmental stresses that alter localization of telomere binding proteins to telomeres of
embryos and as well as nuclear localization in somatic cells of L4 larvae. We propose to characterize how
environmental stresses and longevity pathways epigenetically reprogram the expression of genes whose
introns possess ITS tracts, in part by remodeling the structures of ITS tracts of genes with roles in stress
resistance and longevity.
 Preliminary data indicate that mutating the single-stranded telomere binding protein pot-1 impedes
binding of all single-stranded telomere binding proteins to telomeres. Moreover, pot-1 mutation also induces
moderate longevity, and both longevity and disrupted telomere capping phenotypes can be transmitted by pot-
1 mutant gametes to multiple generations of progeny that possess wild type POT-1 protein. We propose to
study the heritable consequences of telomere uncapping in pot-1 mutant germ cells on expression of genes
with ITS tracts. We will ask if longevity of long-lived mutants, including pot-1 mutants, grown with or without
arsenic is modified by RNAi silencing of ITS tracts or by re-wiring the expression of dsDNA telomere binding
proteins. We will assess the consequences of telomere uncapping defects of pot-1 mutants as well as arsenic
or copper on telomere stability in the absence of telomerase, on telomere mutations and on T-loop formation.
 This work will help to develop a model created by Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamark, who
hypothesized that environmental stresses perceived by parents might modify germ cells in a manner that
would improve fitness of their children. This project may reveal that telomere capping as a malleable epigenetic
factor that can be transmitted from parent to child and is coupled to regulation of genes with ITS tracts in their
introns, in a manner that modulates longevity and resistance to environmental stress in future generations.
However, because somatic telomere length shortens as humans age, and because irreparable DNA damages
accumulate at telomeres in the context of human aging, insight into roles of telomere uncapping, arsenic or
copper in modulating expression of stress response and longevity genes with ITS tracts may be relevant to

Lung cancer is the second deadliest cancer. Despite its prevalence and unfavorable consequences, current
therapeutic approaches are limited. The proposed study aims to understand the biology of lung tumorigenesis
and use that knowledge to lay a foundation to develop potential treatment regimens for lung cancer. Normal cells
undergo finite division and remain quiescent. The dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F, and multi-vulval class B
(DREAM) complex is a cell cycle-regulatory multiprotein complex that orchestrates cell quiescence and the cell
cycle. In association with RBL2/p130 (retinoblastoma-like protein 2), E2F4, and DP1 (E2F dimerization partner
1), the DREAM complex is localized to the promoters of cell cycle-regulating genes, repressing their transcription
and inducing cell quiescence via G0 and G1 arrest. However, dysregulation of such a process causes the cell
quiescence exit and re-entry into abnormal cell proliferation, likely leading to tumor initiation and progression.
Nonetheless, the mechanism of how the DREAM complex is aberrantly regulated in cancer cells remains elusive.
Comprehensive approaches employing genetically engineered animal models and unbiased screening suggest
that PAF (PCNA-associated factor/KIAA0101/PCLAF) plays the oncogenic roles in non-small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) by remodeling the DREAM complex. Intriguingly, we found that aberrantly regulated calcium signaling
enhances the DREAM complex-mediated gene transactivation. Despite the implication of Ca2+ signaling in
cancer, the oncogenic roles of Ca2+ signaling in lung cancer were poorly understood. Based on the preliminary
results, we hypothesize that dysregulated calcium signaling contributes to NSCLC tumorigenesis via the DREAM
complex, which appears to be a targetable vulnerability of lung cancer. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the therapeutic impact of NFAT inhibitors on lung tumorigenesis; Aim 2.
To dissect the mechanism of NFAT-mediated lung tumorigenesis. Completing the proposed research is expected
to advance the development of a new approach for treating lung cancer based on a novel targetable molecular
mechanism involved in lung tumorigenesis."

 Animals ranging from insects to mammals employ specific taste receptors to perceive distinct food flavors,
such as sweet, bitter, sour, and salty. In contrast to other basic taste modalities, salty and sour tastes are
primarily mediated through sodium and proton ion channels, respectively. Animals normally prefer low levels of
salt or acid and reject high concentrations. Since salt and acid are important mineral nutrients, insufficient or
excessive consumption of salt or acid can lead to gastrointestinal, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases.
Although salty and sour tastes have a profound impact on human health, the molecular identities of salty and
sour taste receptors have not been fully determined. In addition, the neuronal circuits underlying salt taste
response and intake are unknown. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model organism, our
previous work identified a new ionotropic glutamate receptor that is required for high-salt sensation.
Additionally, we found that a small subset of neurons in the fly brain regulate high-salt avoidance. Moreover,
we discovered that a novel ion channel, which can be directly activated by protons, is required for the attractive
sour taste response in flies.
 Building on our preliminary findings, we propose to use the fruit fly as a model organism to explore the
molecular and neural mechanisms of salty and sour taste perception. In particular, we will pursue two principal
lines of inquiry: (1) decipher the molecular and neural mechanisms of salty taste sensation; and (2) decipher
the molecular basis of sour taste sensation. Given that taste transduction mechanisms to salt and acid are
analogous between flies and mammals, the molecular insights gleaned from our research in fruit flies will
inform studies of salty and sour taste sensations in mammals, including humans."
10791904,"Mood lability, defined as frequent and exaggerated changes in mood, is an important transdiagnostic symptom
that causes significant impairment and increases suicide risk. This symptom is a common precursor to mood
disorder onset, particularly in youth at familial risk. Since adolescence is a peak period for mood disorder onset
and an important window of neural plasticity, it may be an optimal time for an intervention to decrease mood
lability. Meta-analyses in youth have found that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) decrease mood
symptoms and improve emotion/behavioral dysregulation, constructs closely related to mood lability; however,
neural/behavioral mechanisms of these effects are unknown. It is essential to understand how and for whom
MBIs work, to design interventions that more efficiently engage appropriate targets and deliver treatment to those
most likely to benefit. In adults, MBIs have been shown to increase resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)
between the posterior cingulate (PCC) and the frontoparietal control network (FPCN), neural circuitry which may
subserve awareness of mind-wandering. A behavioral indicator of unintentional mind-wandering, errors on the
Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), has also been found to decrease following MBIs. Since
unintentional mind-wandering amplifies negative affect, awareness of mind-wandering may facilitate the adaptive
use of emotion regulation strategies, leading to improved stress response and decreased mood lability. Indeed,
previous studies have linked increased PCC-FPCN rsFC to downstream effects of decreased anxiety and
depression; and our recent pilot study in youth found that MBI-related increases in PCC-FPCN rsFC predicted
later decreases in mood lability. Given these promising pilot data, the next step is to conduct a randomized
controlled trial to assess MBI-specific effects on mind-wandering related targets and mood lability. In a sample
of 100 adolescents (11-13 years old) with mood lability and a parent with a major mood disorder, we propose to
test whether: (1) an 8-week MBI (vs. control) modifies mind-wandering-related targets (PCC-FPCN rsFC, SART
performance); (2) changes in mind-wandering measures lead to less mood lability; and (3) intake mind-
wandering measures predict differential MBI benefit. Participants will be randomized – stratified on non-mood
DSM-5 diagnosis and sex-by-pubertal status – to an 8-week MBI or control. We will scan youth before, 4 weeks
into, immediately after, and 3 months after intervention to assess longitudinal relationships amongst changes in
PCC-FPCN rsFC and behavioral/clinical measures. Behavioral/clinical outcomes will also be assessed at 9
months post-intervention. We will assess mood lability via self-report and ecological momentary assessment,
focusing on variability in negative affect and ability to sustain positive mood. This design will allow us to assess,
with temporal precision and across levels of analysis, the impact of decreasing unintentional mind-wandering on
subsequent mood lability, focusing on a crucial developmental period in at-risk youth; and will also allow us to
assess who will benefit most from MBIs, moving toward a personalized medicine approach."
10788963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence of water insecurity, or the lack of stable access to safe and acceptable water, is a growing but
overlooked problem in the US. Emerging evidence suggests that water insecurity often co-occurs with food in-
security and could be as detrimental as food insecurity, which is well-established as a major public health issue.
However, little information exists about the concurrence of water and food insecurity among children and ado-
lescents, nor do we understand how water and food insecurity interact to impact key public health nutrition out-
comes, i.e., sugar-sweetened beverage intake and cardiometabolic health and well-being. Therefore, the core
scientific objective of this R03 application is to understand the concurrent role of water and food insecurity
in US child and adolescent health. We will draw on nationally representative data from children and adolescents
aged 2-17 years in the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) from the 2005-2006 wave to the
most current 2017-2020 survey wave (n=19,320). Water insecurity will be assessed using a newly validated
proxy for experiential measures of water insecurity in NHANES, i.e., tap water avoidance, as well as other water
consumption behaviors. Our central hypothesis is that minoritized children will be more likely to experience
water and food insecurity individually and concurrently, and that experiencing both insecurities will compound
vulnerabilities to relevant health outcomes. In Aim 1, we will examine disparities in water and food insecurity
status by race/ethnicity. In Aim 2, we will test independent and interactive associations between water and food
insecurity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. In Aim 3 we will test independent and interactive
associations between water and food insecurity and cardiometabolic health outcomes, including being at risk for
type-2 diabetes, weight status, and high body fat percentage. Increasing our knowledge about how water inse-
curity shapes health is highly significant because global problems with water quantity (both flooding & short-
ages) and quality are occurring with increasing frequency and severity due to climate change, population growth,
and crumbling infrastructure. This project is innovative because it is the first examination of the role of water
insecurity in the health of US children and adolescents. Further, the concurrent measurement of water and food
insecurity will advance public health through insights into their potential for additive or synergistic effects. Ex-
pected outcomes include a clearer picture of the epidemiology of water and food insecurity among US children
and adolescents, and a more precise understanding of how water insecurity can exacerbate the consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages and poor cardiometabolic health. The examination of compounding vulnerabilities
will also advance conceptual understandings of the social and environmental determinants of child health more
broadly. These analyses will likely reveal novel interventions to reduce resource inequities and the risk of poor
health outcomes among vulnerable populations and establish evidence for inclusion of measures of water and
food insecurity among children in other large nutrition and health surveys globally, including in the US."

Children need to learn many shapes, especially letters and numbers for reading. Amblyopic children read 25%
slower than normal controls even when using both eyes. Although problems with fixation and saccadic control
have been identified, shape misperceptions have not been examined. Striking perceptual distortions have been
reported when amblyopic adults are asked to describe or draw oriented sinusoidal gratings or letters at sizes
well above their visual acuity threshold. Shapes are processed through orientation selective neurons in primary
visual cortex (V1), and a person would be severely handicapped in using vision if orientations were encoded or
decoded erroneously. The distortions reported by roughly two-thirds of adult amblyopes are important because
they are not explainable by existing theories of neural scrambling or shifts in the neural map but are compatible
with aliasing by reduced neural sampling of orientation in V1. We have built a theory about how early
differences between eyes in visual resolution or alignment impair development of cortical orientation selectivity.
We discovered that amblyopes have a greater loss of acuity and salience for luminance increments (ON
system) than decrements (OFF system). We also showed that a mosaic of cell properties, including spatial
resolution and orientation selectivity, develops in V1 depending on the spatial gradient of ON and OFF balance
in inputs to cortex. Together these two studies imply that the ON/OFF imbalance created by amblyopia will
reduce spatial resolution and orientation selectivity in populations of V1 neurons. We are currently testing
aspects and implications of this model for adult amblyopes. However, a critical missing piece for understanding
the development of shape perception is knowing whether amblyopic children see distortions, what form these
distortions take, when and how they develop, and whether they respond to treatment. If we could picture what
amblyopic children perceive, we could answer these and many other questions. The drawings that 4–7-year-
old children with amblyopia make of their percepts are unlikely to be accurate renderings, so we propose to
adapt Generative Adversarial Networks to generate perceptograms that match in the good eye what the
children perceive when they are shown gratings to the amblyopic eye. The image generating architecture will
be trained on 30,000 sums of sines, and the adversarial discriminator driven by repeated choices of the closest
match among multiple alternatives. A normal V1 model using marginal and correlational statistics of oriented
cells will be used to compare responses of the perceptograms and their evoking stimuli, then reduced in
coverage and selectivity to generate perceptogram responses from stimulus gratings. The model will be used
to predict amblyopic children’s perceptograms of printed and handwritten letters and numbers from the
EMNIST database, and the critical ones will be measured to understand if perceived shape distortions hamper
reading and learning. This project will thus introduce powerful new tools to amblyopia research that are also
likely to be used for many other childhood visual disorders."

Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that occurs in 5-7% of all pregnancies. Women
exposed to PE are more likely to develop cardiovascular and subclinical cerebrovascular events later in life.
Recent studies suggest an alarming trend that women with a history of PE often experience pronounced
subjective cognitive and psychological dysfunction that significantly alters their quality of life. Although the exact
mechanisms of this subclinical disease are not well understood, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation are
implicated in the pathogenesis of the cerebrovascular and cognitive syndrome after PE. The apelinergic system,
consisting of apelin, elabela (ELA), and the apelin receptor (APJ), is a novel therapeutic pathway in
preeclampsia. Our studies demonstrated that apelin has anti-hypertensive and reno-protective effects. However,
apelin also reduces brain edema, inflammation and oxidative stress in models of transient model of focal cerebral
ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion, and stroke suggesting its potential as neuroprotector. Studies proposed in this
application are based on the clinical evidence suggesting a link between preeclampsia and vascular dementia-
like syndrome experienced by women years after the exposure to PE. Our studies will establish the
neuroprotective actions of apelinergic axis on long-term cerebrovascular consequences of preeclampsia. The
established and well-characterized models of normal pregnancy and preeclampsia are readily available in our
laboratory and will be used for this project. These studies will improve our understanding of the protective role
of apelin/APJ axis in preeclampsia."

DNA modifications, such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) on DNA, as well as
RNA modifications, such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA, have been implicated in gene regulation and
human diseases. Synthetic base analogs, such as BrdU, EdU and IdU, have been used as genomic markers to
study fundamental biological processes. However, conventional approaches to detect DNA/RNA modifications
rely on indirect readout (such bisulfite treatment or immunoprecipitation), cannot assay repetitive regions (due
to the use of short reads), and suffer from various technical biases. While direct DNA/RNA sequencing on the
Oxford Nanopore platform can address these technical limitations, there is an urgent need to develop reliable
bioinformatics methods to detect common DNA/RNA methylations from ionic current data, with the ability to
extend to rare forms of modifications. We have years of dedication to the development of computational tools
for signal-level analysis of long-read sequencing data. We developed NanoMod which detects synthetically
introduced DNA modifications into replicating cells, and DeepMod which uses a deep neural network to predict
5mC directly from ionic current signals from Nanopore sequencing. In the current proposal, we will: (1) Develop
LongReadSum, which will be implemented by multi-threaded C++ with modules for diverse formats (FASTA,
FASTQ, FAST5, BAM, POD5, etc), for ultrafast quality control (QC) and signal summarization from Nanopore
sequencing. The signal summarization procedure generates user-specified feature vectors that can be used by
other downstream machine-learning tools for calling modifications. (2) Develop ModDNA, where we will use
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and transformers, two neural network models, to call modified
bases such as 5mC, 5hmC and 6mA. Additionally, we will adapt the computational pipeline to reduced
representation methylation sequencing (RRMS) data, which enables assaying a human genome in one single
MinION flowcell. (3) Develop ModRNA, an integrative model which combines prior genomic features with
context-dependent features (for example, enrichment in 3’ end of genes) for both de novo and model-based
detection of RNA m6A modifications and other rare modifications. (4) Validate and improve the computational
tools via benchmarking data sets. We will perform Nanopore DNA sequencing from cancer samples with
paired methylation profiles from clinical diagnostic labs, as well as mouse reference cell lines with or without 5-
Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (methylation inhibitor) treatment. We will perform direct mRNA sequencing on reference
cell lines with or without METTL3/METTL14 knockdown, or with in vitro transcription, or with and without KSHV
infection which alters epitranscriptomic profiles. Successful completion of the proposed project delivers a
computational toolbox for DNA/RNA modification detection via Nanopore sequencing, provide reference
datasets to the community, and greatly facilitates our understanding of the human epigenome and
epitranscriptome."

The vertebrate embryo contains hundreds of functionally diverse cell types, however we lack a complete
understanding of the regulatory code that specifies each cell type and how disruptions in this code affect
relationships between lineages. Here, we propose two aims to dissect the accessible regions of the chromatin,
the regulatory motifs and the putative transcription factors that mediate the specification of multiple cell types
during embryogenesis. First, (Aim 1), we will utilize single cell ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq to uncover the
dynamics of chromatin accessibility and the transcriptional profiles that define discrete cell types during early
development. We will define the regulatory motifs in accessible regions of the chromatin that are preferentially
engaged in different cell types. Second (Aim 2), we will use manifold learning approaches to define co-
regulated gene modules and apply a regulatory network inference framework for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
data, and test the regulatory interactions by mutating key pioneer factors and investigate how they cooperate
with other TFs to regulate chromatin accessibility and cell differentiation during development. This project will
generate extensive, high-quality datasets as well as novel computational methods to enable quantitative and
predictive models of embryonic development with the goal to decipher the gene regulatory network specifying
cellular identity during development. Given that early development is conserved across vertebrate species, our
findings have the potential to inform human development, and lay the foundation to investigate the etiologies of
human developmental disorders and to engineer novel cell types and lineages in vitro for regenerative
medicine."

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by lesions of the nails, skin, and oral and genital
mucosae by the fungus Candida albicans. Autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17RA, IL-17RC, and ACT1 deficiencies,
and autosomal dominant (AD) IL-17F deficiency underlie ‘isolated CMC’, while AR CARD9, ROR-g/gT, ZNF341,
IL-12p40, and IL-12Rβ1 deficiencies, AD STAT3, IL6ST/GP130, and JNK1 deficiencies, and AD STAT1 gain-of-
function (GOF) underlie ‘syndromic CMC’. Cells with IL-17RA, IL-17RC, ACT1, or JNK1 deficiency respond poorly
to IL-17A and IL-17F. Cells with IL-17RA or ACT1 deficiency also respond poorly to IL-17E (IL-25). Patients with
ROR-g/gT, ZNF341, STAT3, IL6ST, or JNK1 deficiency, or STAT1 GOF, display low proportions of IL-17A/IL-17F
(IL-17A/F)-producing T cells. Since 2008, we have made major contributions to these discoveries that causally
connected inborn errors of IL-17 immunity with CMC. Three outstanding enigmas are (i) the mechanisms by which
STAT1 mutations can be GOF and by which they impair the development of IL-17 T cells, (ii) the mechanisms by
which inborn errors of STAT3 that impair IL-17 production underlie CMC, while inborn errors of STAT3-activating
cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 apparently do not, and (iii) the genetic etiology of about half of the patients with
isolated or syndromic CMC. We first intend to test the hypotheses that (a) STAT1 GOF mutations impair the
dephosphorylation of nuclear STAT1 by disrupting the formation of antiparallel dimers, thereby preventing the
accessibility of specific phosphatases, and that (b) excessive responses of T cells to IFN-a, IFN-g, and IL-27
collectively impair the development of Th17 cells. We then intend to analyze the production of IL-17 cytokines by
leukocytes from patients with IL-6R, IL-21R, or IL-23R deficiency, in comparison with known etiologies of CMC,
testing the hypothesis that the isolated disruption of IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23 only weakly impairs the development of
Th17 and related IL-17-producing lymphocytes. We finally intend to discover novel CMC-causing genes using
genome-wide (GW) approaches, based on GW linkage (GWL), and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing
(WES/WGS). On the three fronts, we have exciting preliminary results. We found (i) that all STAT1 variants tested
are GOF due to impaired dephosphorylation by the tyrosine phosphatases TC-PTP and PTP1B, by disruption of
antiparallel dimers formation; and the concomitant addition of STAT1-dependent cytokines IFN-a/b, IFN-g, and
IL-27 inhibits the development of IL-17 T cells from naïve CD4+ T cells with STAT1 GOF; (ii) patients with AR IL-
6R or IL-23R deficiency and CMC, implying incomplete penetrance; and (iii) patients with syndromic CMC and
mutations of cRel, RelB, MAP3K6 (also known as ASK2), ZNF375 (zDHHC5), or UBASH3B (TULA-2). From a
biological standpoint, this research will provide new insights into the mechanisms of mucocutaneous immunity to
fungi, while dissecting the molecular and cellular control of human IL-17. From a clinical angle, this work will
provide new molecular diagnoses for patients and genetic counseling for families, while paving the way for new
cytokine-based approaches in patients with CMC."

Malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax is an enormous public health burden throughout the world,
and the cause of significant morbidity. The antimalarial drug chloroquine is the first line of drug treatment for P.
vivax in most countries, and has proven highly efficacious. However, chloroquine resistant (CQR) P. vivax
infections have been widely reported, seriously hampering case management, malaria control efforts, and
elimination programs. Most work on resistance mechanisms has focused on Plasmodium falciparum, while P.
vivax remains poorly studied; nevertheless, P. vivax poses a major impediment to eradication. The molecular
determinants of CQR and resistance to other antimalarials in P. vivax remain unclear, largely due to the lack of
in vitro culture, precluding reverse genetics and robust drug assays. Several candidate drug transporter genes
have been identified in P. vivax with polymorphism in sequence and expression level that could be associated
with CQR and/or resistance to other antimalarials. These genes include pvmdr1, pvcrt-o and pvmrp1, orthologs
of the Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1, pfcrt and pfmrp1 genes, respectively, that are key determinants of
antimalarial susceptibility in P. falciparum. Ex vivo P. vivax susceptibility to chloroquine is associated with specific
P. vivax drug transporter polymorphisms in some but not all studies. It is not clear whether these discrepancies
represent regional differences in parasite diversity and history of exposure to drugs; or result from technical
differences, as no genetic validation has hitherto been possible. Here, we propose a comprehensive analysis of
drug-resistance polymorphisms of P. vivax, utilizing two novel approaches leveraging the zoonotic macaque
parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, which is much closer to P. vivax phylogenetically than is P. falciparum; possesses
superior in vitro genetics with higher transfection efficiencies; and importantly, permits robust determinations of
antimalarial drug susceptibility. We aim to utilize both cutting-edge evolutionary genomic and experimental
forward genetic screening to identify putative determinants of P. vivax drug-resistance. We will subsequently use
in vitro reverse genetic methods in P. knowlesi to functionally assess the importance of prioritized P. vivax genetic
polymorphisms in mediating antimalarial drug-resistance. We hypothesize that these polymorphisms, either
singly or in combination, have been selected in specific regions of the world by antimalarial use against P. vivax.
The identification of specific polymorphisms that mediate different levels of susceptibility to chloroquine, and
other antimalarial compounds in current clinical use, including artemisinin and its partner drugs, will be key to
their use in surveillance, molecular epidemiological studies, and the design of strategies to prolong the
usefulness of these drugs."

The Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
(Mount Sinai) proposes to continue and the successful existing Short-term Research Education Program to
Enhance Diversity in Health-Related Research. The goal of the Program is to nurture trainees who are from
underrepresented backgrounds and have interests in science and medicine. We do this by enhancing their
research capacity in a way that supports multidisciplinary training and long-term engagement with mentors.
The proposed program will continue to build on experience gained with existing programs that have already
been very successful in providing research training, offered career mentoring and guided many participating
students towards achieving their professional goals. The current proposal builds on the most effective features
of the program as determined through continuous and systematic long-term evaluation. First, the program is
multidisciplinary. Rather than selecting mentors and projects within a particular scientific discipline, the
program draws from a very diverse mentor pool who all work on different aspects of the NHLBI’s mission. The
program includes mentors with expertise in community-based research, epidemiology, public health, global
health, occupational health and others. This allows for students with interests ranging from molecular biology to
population health to be included in the program. Second, the program has strong institutional support. It was
originally founded in 1995 and has been continuously funded since then (first by NIEHS, then by NHLBI), a
testament to the dedication and commitment of the participating faculty and the program director, who has
directed the program all that time. Third, the program sits within a portfolio of other educational programs at
Mount Sinai that expose trainees to a wealth of opportunities and career options. Finally, the program has
provided long-term follow-up of student participants, creating a sense of community among trained
participants, an important connection as students continue to grow in their career paths. This continuity is
reassuring as trainees develop in a professional environment in which people of color and those of low
socioeconomic means are still vastly underrepresented. The program has continued to evolve since its
inception. In order to expand and grow, it has developed the following Specific Aims: 1) To select, train and
nurture a cadre of underrepresented students and to motivate and support them in their professional
development. 2) To provide students who participate in the program with long-term mentoring and guidance
throughout the length of their careers. During the current iteration of the program, 38 students have
participated, bringing the total number of alumni to 157. This proposal expects to add another 30 trainees to
this cadre. A plan for long-term follow-up and strong evaluation strategies will continue to be incorporated in
order to support underrepresented scientists at all stages in their career development."

Microbial biofilms are a significant source of microbial infections and represent an ongoing burden to the
healthcare industry. Recent studies indicate that an estimated 65% - 80% of all bacterial infections derive from
biofilm formation. In the case of topical infections, biofilm formation is associated with wound chronicity. Indeed,
it has been reported that microbial biofilm is present in over 90% of wounds that are chronic in nature or are
otherwise slow to heal. These chronic wounds affect an estimated 2% of the total population of the United States,
annually. The global annual cost for medical care associated with chronic wounds is predicted to reach $3.5
billion this year. Taken in total, it is clear that there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to both prevent
new biofilm formation as well as combat established biofilms. The metal-free semiconductor graphitic carbon
nitride (g-C3N4) is an attractive target for the development of such technologies due to its’ established ability to
efficiently reduce elemental oxygen to generate a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the
superoxide radical anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This activity effectively mimics the oxidative burst
exhibited by neutrophils as part of the mammalian immune response to invasive organisms. Notably, the
antimicrobial activity of ROS, including H2O2, can be enhanced several orders of magnitude via conversion into
a variety of reactive halogen species (RHS), including HOCl, HOI and others. The reactive nature of ROS/RHS
may also impact a variety of population-dependent events by interrupting microbial quorum signaling processes.
Taking inspiration from this activity, we hypothesize that tandem g-C3N4/peroxidase systems, which directly
couple the efficient photochemical ROS formation of the semiconductor with a secondary halogenation
step, will exhibit enhanced utility for antimicrobial, anti-biofilm and anti-quorum sensing applications.
To facilitate the successful development of these new microbiocidal agents, experiments included as part of
Specific Aim 1 will be directed toward the synthesis and characterization of a series of tandem g-C3N4/peroxidase
systems that demonstrate efficient formation of ROS and RHS. Successful production of the desired RHS will
be confirmed by a combination of spectrophotometric assays and molecular trapping experiments. Experiments
in Aim 2 will serve to validate the utility of the tandem g-C3N4/peroxidase systems for microbiocidal, anti-biofilm
and anti-quorum sensing applications. Complementary mechanistic and mammalian cell toxicity studies will
provide critical information about the relative utility of the broader class of organic semiconductors, including g-
C3N4, for biomedical and antimicrobial applications. All of the experiments described in this proposal will directly
incorporate undergraduate student researchers, who have been responsible for generating much of the
preliminary data that is presented here. Taken in total, the experiments that are incorporated into this proposal
will serve to establish the biomedical utility of g-C3N4-based materials and other, related organic semiconductors
as novel functional devices capable of combatting microbial biofilms and chronic infections."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are emerging as two of the most critical 
global health challenges of the 21st century. NAFLD is estimated to affect up to one third of the general 
population, and NAFLD is nearly universally present in patients with T2D, with 75-100% of participants
demonstrating hepatic steatosis, and with 50% and 19% demonstrating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
and cirrhosis, respectively. Furthermore, NAFLD represents the most common cause of liver disease in 
children and adolescents. Studies by our group and others have shown a strong relationship between NAFLD, 
hepatic insulin resistance and T2D, however the cellular mechanisms that lead to hepatic insulin resistance 
and increased gluconeogenesis remain to be established. The studies proposed in this grant build on our 
previous studies that have shown that reduction of hepatic fat content through enhancement of hepatic 
mitochondrial lipid oxidation can reverse hepatic insulin resistance and diabetes in rodent and nonhuman 
primate models of NAFLD, NASH and T2D. The Overarching Aims that will be addressed in this grant will be 
to determine if rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation are altered in NAFLD, NASH and T2D and whether 
promoting chronic increases in rates of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation by means of a chronic glucagon 
infusion will reduce hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance in individuals with NAFLD. To address 
these questions we will apply a novel Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) method that we 
have recently developed to: i) Assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation, pyruvate carboxylase flux and 
hepatic ketogenesis in participants with NAFLD, NASH and type 2 diabetes, ii) Assess rates of hepatic 
mitochondrial oxidation, hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux and hepatic ketogenesis and hepatic steatosis in the 
elderly and iii) Assess the effects of chronic glucagon treatment on rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation, 
pyruvate carboxylase flux, hepatic ketogenesis, hepatic fat content and hepatic insulin sensitivity in individuals 
with NAFLD. The results of these studies will provide important new insights regarding the role of altered 
hepatic mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, NASH and T2D, which in turn will have important 
implications for the development of novel liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling therapies aimed at increasing 
hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation to treat NAFLD, NASH and T2D, which are currently being evaluated in 
Phase 2b trials. The present study will also provide critical information regarding the acute and chronic effects 
of glucagon on hepatic mitochondrial oxidation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, hepatic insulin sensitivity and hepatic 
fat metabolism which has important implications for dual GLP-1/glucagon agonists and triple GLP1/GIP/glucagon agonists which are now being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of obesity, NAFLD, 
NASH and T2D."

process within the DSRC that optimizes accrual of potentially eligible cancer patients and patients
at risk for cancer to NCTN Cooperative Group clinical trials, and 3) To further increase minority

10793393,"Abstract: Childhood lead (Pb2+) exposure results in cognitive function deficits and is associated with
neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) later in life. Deficits in cognitive function and sensorimotor
gating represent core symptoms of chronic early life Pb2+ exposure (CELLE) and psychiatric disease resulting in
life-long disability that is currently untreatable. To develop effective treatments, it is critical to understand and
integrate neurobiological deficits at multiple levels of analysis. Our proposed studies aim to further understand
the effects of CELLE at the cellular level and the resulting effects on brain networks and circuits, regional brain
volume and connectivity, and how these changes result in behavioral deficits filling gaps in knowledge on the
neurobiology of CELLE as a risk factor for psychiatric disease. Our central hypothesis is that CELLE alters
the maturation and function of parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons (PVGI), disrupting the
excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, producing networks and circuits abnormalities and brain
dysconnectivity, leading to behavioral and cognitive deficits. We will also test the hypothesis that the brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mimetic and blood-brain-barrier permeable nutraceutical 7,8-dihydroxyflavone
(7,8-DHF) is effective in mitigating the negative effects of CELLE with translational implications for the treatment of
Pb2+-exposed children. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims (SA): SA1 will determine
the effects of CELLE on behavior and cognitive function and the developmental trajectory of PVGI in the middle
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HIPP). Behaviors will include reference and working memory in the
8-arm radial arm maze (8-RAM) and pre-pulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) using a life course
approach. We will also examine PVGI development using cell markers including PV (cell identification), GAD67,
and perineuronal nets (PNN) in the mPFC and HIPP. SA2 will determine the effect of CELLE in mPFC-HIPP at
the network and circuit levels during active 8-RAM and PPI behaviors and relate them to the PVGI markers.
CELLE-induced electrophysiological network abnormalities will be examined in delta (1-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), and
gamma (30-120Hz) ranges during behavior. Circuitry contributing to abnormal network activity will be tested in
mPFC-HIPP circuitry using a viral-based inhibitory designer receptors specifically activated by a designer drug
(DREAADs; retroAAV-hM4Di) approach. We will also perform volumetric MRI and fiber tractography to
understand CELLE effects that will complement and augment the electrophysiology studies on brain connectivity.
SA3 will test a strategy to restore normal function in CELLE rats. We will use the nutraceutical 7,8-DHF, a BDNF
mimetic and TrkB agonist, as a potential therapy for CELLE effects across several levels of analysis as described
in SA1 and SA2. The proposed studies will provide new foundational knowledge about the neurobiology of
CELLE as a risk factor for psychiatric disease. Furthermore, they will assess the effectiveness of 7,8-DHF as a
therapy for translational studies with potential benefits to millions of Pb2+-exposed children."
10793161,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
A range of lung diseases and critical illnesses, including complications of mechanical ventilation, as well as
trauma can result in air leak from the lung (pneumothorax). These leaks often require immediate life-saving
measures to stabilize for subsequent reparative interventions. Continued care can further be complicated by
chronic air leaks (bronchopleural fistula, BPF) requiring need for prolonged chest tube drainage and/or invasive
surgery and can be difficult to manage. These all result in significantly increased morbidity, mortality, hospital
stays, health care costs, and other complications. However, at present there are only limited options for directly
repairing pleural leaks, particularly chronic leaks, and new therapeutic interventions are critically needed.
We have developed a novel sealant patch consisting of dopamine-conjugated methacrylated seaweed-derived
alginate (ALG-MA-DA). The patch has desired materials properties, including tailorable stiffness, elasticity, and
adhesive strength, and is easily transported and applied to the lung surface. We have further designed, tested,
and documented safety and efficacy in initial pre-clinical studies utilizing ex vivo and in vivo small and large
(rat/pig) models of lung injuries.
We now propose to further define optimal GMP-grade manufacturing, sterilization, and storage conditions, and
to further define longitudinal safety and efficacy in the small (rat) and large (pig) animal models of pleural injuries.
This will include assessing sealant patch efficacy with larger wounds and also assess efficacy of shelf-stored
patches. We will also engage with the FDA for development of initial clinical investigations and a Pre-Sub (Q)
meeting is scheduled for April 10, 2023. The studies will be done with our industry partner Akina Inc and
Accelerator partner CELLINK LLC.
The developed system will fall under the FDA category as a class III medical device given both its invasive
application and its use in supporting or sustaining human life. As such, the proposed Specific Aims are
consonant with the goals of the NIH Catalyze Program HL-23-014, “Product Definition Device Prototype Testing
and Design Modification”.
1. To define optimal sterilization, preservation, and storage conditions of ready-to-use research-grade patches
and apply this to manufacture and characterization of GMP-grade ALG-MA-DA patches
2. To further define ALG-MA-DA patch safety and efficacy in long-term rat and pig pleural injury models
3. To engage with the FDA and initiate an IND for initial clinical investigation."
10799638,"Abstract
Opioid and catecholamine receptors are key regulators of neurophysiology and behavior, and are important
targets of therapeutic and abused drugs. These receptors all belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
superfamily, the largest group of signaling receptors expressed in animals and a very important class of drug
targets. GPCRs signal by allostery and are extensively regulated after ligand-induced activation by
phosphorylation, endocytosis and interacting with a class of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins called arrestins.
These regulatory processes are critically important to the actions of addictive drugs, which are typically
administered repeatedly or over a prolonged period, and there is evidence for considerable diversity of the
effects of drugs on these processes. The present research program is focused on elucidating the fundamental
mechanistic basis of such selective regulation. In the previous funding period, we delineated drug-selective
biochemical modes by which a functionally relevant GPCR kinase is recruited from the cytoplasm by opioid
receptors. We also identified evidence for a discrete form of biased drug action determined by differences in
the subcellular location of receptor activation. We also discovered a distinct mechanism of cellular arrestin
regulation that defined by being independent of receptor phosphorylation. The proposed studies seek to extend
this fundamental research effort with the goal of developing new understanding that can be leveraged for
therapeutic benefit. Specifically, we propose to (1) Define an allosteric basis for agonist-selective
phosphorylation of opioid receptors; (2) Delineate localization and trafficking of opioid-relevant adenylyl cyclase
isoforms; and (3) Determine if β-arrestin has a phosphorylation-independent role in opioid drug discrimination."
10802323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a five-year training plan for the development of an independent research career focused
on the role of the distal airway epithelium in human lung injury and regeneration. Specifically, the applicant strives
to understand the regulation of a novel human specific secretory population called respiratory airway secretory
cells (RASCs), which can act as progenitors for alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, and understand how this population
is altered in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The applicant is in her final year of Pulmonary and
Critical Care fellowship at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with previous PhD training in cellular
and molecular biology with a focus on cell fate regulation. The goals of this award are to refine and develop skills
that will be necessary for a successful career as an independent investigator including expertise in epigenomics,
mammalian gene editing, and advanced bioinformatic analysis. The mentor for this award is Dr. Edward
Morrisey, an internationally renowned expert in lung regeneration and repair with an outstanding and expansive
training record. Furthermore, an advisory committee of complementary and diverse scientists has been
assembled to provide breadth and depth to the training plan. The applicant will benefit from the unparalleled
mentoring, resources and scientific community at the University of Pennsylvania and the unreserved support of
her institution.
 The aims of this proposal are focused on expanding our knowledge of an understudied region of the human
lung, the respiratory bronchioles. Respiratory bronchioles are absent in mouse and hence their role in lung injury,
regeneration and repair is essentially unknown and often over-looked. Recent data demonstrate that respiratory
bronchioles are a site of injury in COPD, highlighting the need to understand the molecular regulation and
function of cell populations within this niche. This project will examine the regulation of a novel cell type recently
identified in the human respiratory bronchioles, RASCs. RASCs can serve as progenitors for AT2 cells, and are
transcriptionally altered in COPD, suggesting that their function could be altered in, and contribute to, the
pathogenesis of this highly prevalent disease. This highlights the scientific need to investigate this cell type and
its response to injury. Successful completion of these proposed studies will address the central hypothesis that
the cell fate and progenitor function of RASCs is regulated through a combination of Notch signaling and the
transcription factor SOX4, and that this progenitor function is altered in COPD. This will be accomplished through
multiple techniques including human embryonic stem cell modeling, next-generation sequencing, and advanced
epigenetic analysis of primary human lung tissue. These studies will provide significant insight into a novel lung
progenitor cell and have a high potential for therapeutic impact in COPD and lung regeneration more broadly."
10802324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are currently 50 million people suffering globally with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 95% of the population
over age 65 is concerned about their dementia risk and 80% are interested in dementia screening. There is a
critical need for accessible and cost-effective biomarkers that can be used to identify those on the ADRD
continuum – including the asymptomatic stages – not only in research and specialty-care centers, but in
community-based and primary care settings as well. This information could dramatically improve referrals for
early clinical trial enrollment, the triage process for specialty evaluation, and comprehensive care planning.
The methods used must be appropriate for point-of-care, community, or at-home deployment while maintaining
accuracy and predictive value.
Olfactory (sense of smell) dysfunction (OD), in combination with machine learning (ML) algorithms, is a
promising non-invasive biomarker for ADRD. We have previously demonstrated the reliability of the Affordable
Rapid Olfactory Measurement Array (AROMA) to objectively measure OD and categorize olfactory phenotypes
(patterns of correct and incorrect responses to various odorants and multiple concentrations). AROMA uses
essential oils, which are complex blends of odor molecules and may be more reflective of “real world” olfaction
than the single chemicals used in most other tests. This is because when scents are encountered in real life,
the brain processes and recognizes the odorant combinations making up each complete scent differently from
the individual component chemicals. Our research with AROMA in ADRD has shown that AROMA can
distinguish cognitively unimpaired (CU), mildly cognitively impaired (MCI), and AD patients from one another.
Additionally, olfactory phenotypes were detected using machine learning and differentiated between disease
states. Our algorithms had 100% sensitivity, 83% specificity for correctly classifying CU versus MCI/AD.
Algorithms tasked with classifying MCI versus AD had 100% sensitivity, 75% specificity.
We propose longitudinal testing of CU, MCI, AD subjects (n=324 men and women > 55 years) over 3 years to
assess changes in OD, functional status, and neurocognition. A group of neurologic controls will be included to
ensure olfactory phenotypes are specific for ADRD. Using traditional statistics and machine learning
techniques to examine the relationship of AROMA performance with ATN-biomarkers and clinical markers of
disease (Aim 1); define predictive models using AROMA data to predict changes in function and frailty (Aim 2);
and develop a streamlined ADRD-version of AROMA using only the scents and concentrations of highest
influence (Aim 3). Our long-term goal is for point-of-care olfactory biomarker data, analyzed in real-time by ML
algorithms, to be widely accessible to meaningfully inform clinical, research, and caregiver decisions."
10802326,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K01 proposal will prepare the candidate for an independent research career studying environmental and
biological contributors to child neurodevelopmental trajectories in typically-developing and high-risk populations,
with specific expertise in human developmental behavioral epigenetics and clinically-relevant cognitive
phenotypes (e.g., inattention). Research in developmental psychopathology has been successful in identifying
risk factors for attention problems across multiple domains, including biological, cognitive, and caregiving factors.
However, a missed opportunity is the study of multiple, longitudinal trajectories of risk factors in relation to
trajectories of inattention. Specifically, there is a need to understand whether there are heterogeneous
trajectories of inattention in early childhood, particularly during the transition to formal schooling (age 5-7) when
increases in inattention are common. Further, understanding how changes in risk factors across early childhood
relate to changes in inattention across the transition to formal schooling could provide critical information
regarding modifiable targets and optimal timing for screening and intervening with high-risk children. The
proposed study will leverage existing data from two parent grants (R01HD072267; R01HD084515; NOVI study)
focused on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born very preterm. The current study proposes to test
associations between trajectories of biological (i.e., DNA methylation), cognitive (i.e., executive function) and
caregiving (i.e., psychological distress) factors and trajectories of child inattention in a sample of children born
very preterm, a group known to be at elevated risk for attention problems. Specific aims are as follows: (1) to
characterize trajectories of inattention in very preterm children; (2) to test the contributions of biological, cognitive,
and caregiving factors to trajectories of inattention; and (3) to test how changes in biological, cognitive, and
caregiving factors relate to trajectories of inattention. The applicant’s mentorship team will scaffold completion
of the study aims and provide needed training in (1) processing and (2) analysis of high-dimensional, longitudinal
epigenetic data, (3) advanced statistical techniques for longitudinal data analysis, and (4) frameworks (e.g.,
RDOC) for studying child psychopathology. The resources and intellectual environment at the Brown Center for
the Study of Children at Risk, Women and Infant’s Hospital, and Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown
University constitute an ideal setting to launch an independent research career. This project will provide
preliminary data for a future R01 investigating how trajectories of DNA methylation are established and altered
across development (e.g., as a function of environmental risk factors) as well as grants that follow NOVI children
into later childhood. This project is aligned with NIMH strategic priorities given its focus on charting the
development of inattention in childhood, identifying risk factors and biomarkers for inattention that could serve
as novel intervention targets, and isolating sensitive periods for interventions aimed at mitigating long-term
functional impairment."
10802360,"The Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) TL1 training program has a long history of preparing
University of Washington (UW) predoctoral investigators to become successful translational scientists. Since
2007, 131 individuals have completed the yearlong program and over 90% are still engaged in research or
training. The experience brings together trainees from a broad range of scientific disciplines and varied expertise.
Cohort-based learning emphasizes collaboration and teamwork, skills critical to interdisciplinary research. The
curriculum, based on nationally developed translational science competencies, uses interactive educational
methods that encourage trainees to think independently, and provides a shared learning experience rich in real-
world examples of how translational science is conducted. Trainees complete a translational research project
under the supervision of mentors from ITHS partner institutions and are guided by an individualized career
development plan created with their mentor(s) and TL1 Program Directors, who are themselves experienced
translational investigators. In the next 5 years, the ITHS TL1 program will be augmented in 2 significant ways:
1. Enhance the existing educational program through brief real-world practicums across the
translational phases of development, demonstration, and dissemination. Trainees will select practicum
opportunities such as participating in ITHS service consultations on research projects or following the
development of an IRB protocol or intellectual property disclosure. Options will be tailored to trainees’
backgrounds, experience in related competencies, and career plans. Experiences will enhance translational
science skills by helping trainees see classroom concepts in practice, exposing them to more disciplines and
approaches, and observing an interdisciplinary team in action.
2. Adapt the UW TL1 program for the 5-state Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho region
by establishing a TL1 cohort at Montana State University using a collaborative, hybrid educational
model. Montana State is a robust academic research institution supported by substantial federal funding with
programs in rural health equity, rural and tribal populations, and emerging infectious diseases. The proposed
cohort brings together 12 TL1 predoctoral trainees at UW and 6 at Montana State in a bi-directional, joint training
effort. Trainees will be linked via a virtual online learning platform, with faculty and staff from both sites offering
training content in their respective areas of expertise. This expansion builds on existing and emerging
collaborations between both institutions with experienced staff, directors, and resources needed to successfully
train the next generation of translational research scientists.
The established TL1 curriculum will ensure continued quality and rigor in training for all students, while the
proposed new aims will reinforce learning through real-world application and expand training strengths and
experiences through collaboration between UW and Montana State University faculty and students."

Mycobacterium avium (MAC) and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can cause chronic, insidious and
often debilitating lung disease necessitating complicated and extensive multi-drug antibiotic therapy that can be
life-long. Additionally, 50% of treated patients who have culture conversion to negative will suffer a relapse of
either their existing infection or a new infection. While NTM are ubiquitous in the environment and human
exposure throughout life is frequent, pulmonary disease is found almost exclusively among the elderly. It is
therefore not surprising that pulmonary NTM disease is increasing in incidence and prevalence, mirroring
changes in the overall age structure of the U.S. Mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to NTM
disease with age are not well understood. Consequently, there is an unmet need in virtually all aspects of this
disease and its management, including an understanding of disease pathogenesis. Adding urgency to this
research area is the fact that the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that by 2030, more than 20% of the US residents
are projected to be at least 65 years old and over. In this application, we propose to test the central hypothesis
that aged individuals are more susceptible to NTM disease due to defects in Th1 T cell immunity coupled
with dysregulation in lung microbiome that favor the acquisition of pathogenic bacteria. To that end, we
will leverage the highly translational rhesus macaque model to first identify age-associated changes in
immunological parameters, inflammatory markers and microbial community. Then, we will leverage a novel
rhesus macaque model established by our group that recapitulates the hallmarks of pulmonary MAC disease to
carry out experimental prospective studies to uncover age-mediated alterations in immune responses and lung
microbial communities that are associated with susceptibility to and development of chronic NTM pulmonary
disease. These studies will lead to novel insight into the pathogenesis of this chronic lung disease that causes
significant morbidity in the elderly and continues to increase in incidence and prevalence as the American
population ages. Identification of immune or microbiome correlates of protection or risk of disease could lead
directly to improvements in the clinical care of these patients and the prevention of this disease in the elderly."

Approximately 40% of Latino MSM with HIV do not achieve viral suppression—an estimate that has likely
worsened due to COVID-19 Pandemic stressors such as unemployment, loss of health insurance,
homelessness, and exacerbated mental health and substance use disorders caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is associated with decreased viral load, increased CD4
counts, fewer hospital days, slower disease progression, and longer survival. Adherence also helps prevent
drug resistance and reduces HIV transmission risk. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
efficacy of stepped care strategies to improve ART adherence among adult Latino MSM with HIV using a
sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART). The trial will compare a stepped care strategy of
delivering TXTXT first and stepping up to remote patient navigation for non-responders vs. a stepped care
strategy of delivering TXTXT + e-Navigation first and stepping up to EMA-supported e-Navigation for non-
responders. Both, TXTXT (“Treatment Text”) and the foundations of the e-Navigation interventions are CDC
evidence-based interventions (EBI). We propose to use a SMART design which explicitly allows building,
testing, and optimizing stepped care strategies without compromising rigor or randomization. We propose three
specific aims: Aim 1. Compare the immediate (6-month) and sustained (9- and 12-month) efficacy of two static
(non-stepped) treatment regimens (TXTXT alone vs. TXTXT + e-Navigation) on ART adherence and viral
suppression among Latino MSM with HIV. Aim 2. Compare the immediate (6-month) and sustained (9- and
12-month) efficacy of two stepped care strategies (TXTXT with added e-Navigation for non-responders vs.
TXTXT + e-Navigation with added EMA support for non-responders) on ART adherence and viral suppression
among Latino MSM with HIV. Aim 3. Identify baseline and time-varying moderators on the association
between stepped care strategy and ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV. The
proposed study is innovative by culturally adapting and combining two EBIs, using a stepped care approach,
remote patient navigators, adaptive EMA components, and a SMART design. The proposed study is significant
because it provides data on the efficacy of two scalable EBIs in one efficient design and provides data on
enhanced treatment options for non-responders. The study is also significant because it targets an NIH health
disparity population (Latino MSM) and addresses multiple domains and levels of influence on health and health
disparities. It also targets people living in an Ending the HIV Epidemic geographic focus area with the highest
HIV diagnosis rate in the nation (South Florida), thereby supporting the objectives of reducing HIV disparities in
populations at high risk and living in the Southern US."

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a major cause of cancer in the context of HIV/AIDS. We
recently showed that KSHV-transformed primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines exhibit a strong requirement
for the cellular lymphoid transcription factor IRF4. This finding places PEL into an emerging group of blood
cancers where IRF4 is a key oncogenic driver. A detailed understanding of the oncogenic roles of IRF4 has not
been achieved in any of these cancers, but evidence suggests that IRF4 functions as a master transcription
factor that induces extensive epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming. In PEL, IRF4 is required for
overexpression of the MYC oncogene, but how KSHV controls IRF4, the molecular mechanism by which IRF4
regulates MYC, and whether IRF4 acts solely through MYC or has additional oncogenic roles is unknown. The
long-term objective of this proposal is to determine the downstream effects that underlie the oncogenic roles of
IRF4 in PEL and to use our results to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that KSHV-induced, IRF4-dependent oncogenic transcriptional reprogramming is required for tumor
cell survival and proliferation in PEL. This hypothesis is premised on our extensive preliminary work, which has
identified both KSHV-encoded and cellular transcription factors that control IRF4 expression and function in PEL.
Based on ChIP-Seq and mRNA-Seq experiments, we specifically hypothesize that IRF4, together with its viral
and cellular co-factors, associates with promoters and distal cis-regulatory elements to drive an IRF4-dependent
oncogenic transcription program, which involves both the silencing of “toxic” tumor suppressors and the
overexpression of several essential survival genes, including MYC, but also others. To test our hypothesis, we
propose two Specific Aims, i.e. we will: (1) determine which toxic genes must be silenced by IRF4 to promote
PEL cell viability and proliferation, and (2) determine which IRF4-stimulated genes are essential IRF4 effectors
in PEL cells. Several of the already identified candidates for IRF4 effectors are high-confidence drug targets. We
will therefore exploit our results in both aims to identify and test novel therapeutic strategies, in vitro and in vivo.
This work uses a cutting-edge approach that integrates hypothesis-driven experiments with unbiased functional
genomics approaches. The proposed study is innovative, because the oncogenic outcome of transcriptional
reprogramming in the context of KSHV-associated malignancies has not been studied. The proposed work is
significant, because it will uncover oncogenic roles of IRF4 in KSHV-mediated B cell proliferation and survival.
In addition, results will inform our understanding of IRF4 in B cell biology and its oncogenic role in several
hematopoietic malignancies. Results will be impactful, because our studies of IRF4 dependency are expected
to result in improved strategies for therapeutic intervention in this incurable cancer."
10931690,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During our previous studies, we established synaptic zinc as a powerful neuromodulator of synaptic
transmission, synaptic plasticity, and sound processing. Based on these findings and our preliminary results, we
propose that cortical synaptic zinc is a crucial neuromodulator for cortical adaptation and plasticity (recovery)
after noise trauma (peripheral damage). Namely, we plan to answer two main questions: 1) What are the cell-
type-specific zincergic neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying cortical adaptation to different background
sound statistics? And 2) How do cell-type-specific zincergic neuromodulatory mechanisms contribute to cortical
and perceptual recovery after peripheral damage? Answering these questions will advance the field to a new
level of understanding about cortical neuromodulatory mechanisms during normal and pathological sensory
processing, and create a new framework for approaching and interpreting cortical adaptation and plasticity.
Importantly, our proposed studies hold the potential to highlight novel strategies for enhancing hearing after
hearing loss, and for mitigating disorders that are associated with maladaptive central plasticity after peripheral
damage, such as hyperacusis and tinnitus"

Despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the mechanisms of development and progression of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain elusive. Microglia and other myeloid origin cells (collectively called human
brain immune cells, or HBICs) have recently emerged as crucial players in the pathogenesis of AD. This is
supported through genetic association studies, where many of the common and rare risk loci affect genes that
are preferentially or selectively expressed in HBICs, emphasizing the pivotal role of the innate immune system
in AD. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing analysis in mouse models of AD has identified a microglia
subpopulation that is present at sites of neurodegeneration. It is unclear if HBICs assume a protective or
damaging role, but that might vary depending on the stage and progression of AD. Therefore, further analysis
of microglia and other immune cells purified from human brains is needed to understand the state of HBIC
activity in human AD at different stages of disease. As HBICs constitute a small proportion of total brain cells,
homogenate-based studies in human brain tissue are unlikely to capture the full spectrum of HBIC molecular
signatures, especially in light of the growing appreciation for the diversity of HBICs in the brain. The proposed
work addresses some of the limitations of previous research and is focused on: (1) cell type specific and single
cell studies in immune cells isolated from human brain tissue; and (2) a systematic study of the regulatory
effects of non-coding DNA on gene and protein expression, which is necessary given that the majority of
common risk variants are situated in non-coding regions of the genome. More specifically, our application is
uniquely designed to: (1) apply innovative genomic approaches and generate multi-omics data from HBICs
isolated from 300 donors, including whole genome sequencing, RNAseq, ATACseq, HiC chromosome
conformation capture and proteomics; (2) perform state-of-the-art single cell analysis that will allow us to
assess the diversity of HBIC subpopulations, as well as detect those that are associated with AD; (3) connect
AD risk loci with changes in the regulatory mechanisms of gene and protein expression in HBICs; and (4)
organize HBIC multiscale data in functional networks and identify key drivers for AD. Our overall hypothesis is
that HBIC subpopulations assume a neuroprotective role during aging and early stages of AD, but as disease
progresses, specific HBIC subpopulations transform to neuroinflammatory phenotype(s). This conversion is
partially driven by AD risk genetic variants, which affect regulatory mechanisms of genes that are key drivers of
neuroinflammatory HBIC subpopulations. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide: (1) an
increased mechanistic understanding of dysfunction in AD risk loci; (2) prioritization of significant loci and
genes for future mechanistic studies; and (3) access to large-scale, multidimensional datasets, together with
systems level analyses of these datasets for transcriptional regulation in HBICs, which is an urgently needed
(and currently missing) resource."

Nearly half of all patients starting dialysis are now over age 65. Median survival after initiating dialysis is short
and patients experience frequent hospital stays, pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and depression. Yet few
receive palliative care in time to alleviate symptoms, document care goals and prepare for end of life. Given
the burdens of treatment and poor prognosis, older adults with end-stage kidney disease would benefit from
upstream interventions that both improve decision making about dialysis and promote timely receipt of
palliative care in order to clarify goals, address symptoms and reduce unwanted invasive procedures. This
proposal serves the long-term goal of increasing the use of palliative care for older patients with life-limiting
illnesses and reducing unwanted invasive treatments at the end of life.
“Best Case/Worst Case: A Multisite Randomized Clinical Trial of Scenario Planning for Patients with
End-Stage Kidney Disease” is a five-year R01 that responds specifically to PA-18-502 for development and
evaluation of innovative decision aids for seriously ill older patients and/or their proxy decision makers. Our
research team has developed a novel communication tool called “Best Case/Worst Case” that employs
scenario planning and a graphic aid to illustrate options, acknowledge uncertainty and describe outcomes
within the context of the patient's underlying health and prognosis. We have pilot-tested this intervention for
patients with kidney disease and demonstrated that nephrologists can use this tool to improve decision making
about dialysis and this may increase utilization of palliative care. We are now ready to test the intervention in a
large-scale efficacy study. We propose a multisite cluster randomized trial in which 320 patients making a
dialysis initiation decision receive nephrologist communication using the Best Case/Worst Case tool, or
communication as usual. We aim to test the effect of the Best Case/Worst Case intervention on receipt of
palliative care and intensity of treatment at the end of life (Aim 1), quality of life (Aim 2), and the quality of
communication (Aim 3) for older patients with end-stage kidney disease.
This award will allow us to test an intervention that is easily scalable and can be disseminated rapidly for use
with older patients with life-limiting kidney disease. The research is innovative because it tests scenario
planning —a decision-making strategy that has been successfully applied in business and government—but is
not widely used in healthcare. The research is significant because if the intervention is effective, it has the
potential to transform how specialists talk about options and dramatically improve receipt of palliative care.
Our multidisciplinary team has a long history of collaboration. We are well positioned to achieve our objectives
within the scope of this award given our strong pilot data and commitment from the Palliative Care Research
Cooperative Group and its nephrologist-members to conduct this study."

The current project examines the neural basis of Braille reading in proficient congenitally blind adults, late blind
readers with varying degrees of proficiency and blind children learning to read, using fMRI and high-density
diffusion imaging (dMRI). These studies of Braille literacy provide insights into human brain plasticity and the
neural basis of culture.
 Reading changes the anatomy and function of the human brain. In sighted people, reading experience
enhances anatomical pathways within and across visual and language networks. Sighted readers develop a
‘visual word form area’ (VWFA) in lateral ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lVOT), tuned to letters and words.
Braille offers insights into the mechanisms of cultural recycling by disentangling which aspects of the reading
brain are modality invariant and which are modality specific. The current proposal distinguishes between two
alternative hypotheses. According to the task-based hypothesis, blind readers develop the same neural
mechanisms for reading as the sighted in the lVOT and show similar connectivity changes, because lVOT is
intrinsically predisposed for modality-invariant shape recognition. By contrast, the connectivity-based
hypothesis proposes that connectivity and experience heavily influence reading localization. It therefore
predicts that blind individuals develop tactile word form areas (TWFAs) in parietal regions with strong
connectivity to somatosensory and language networks. It also predicts that Braille literacy enhances
anatomical connectivity of these parietal network.
 Aim 1 investigates the neural changes support this expert reading in congenitally blind adults. Proficient
Braille readers can achieve speeds of 200 words per minute and more. What neural changes enable this
ability? In a series of fMRI experiments with congenitally blind proficient readers we use MVPA and fMRI
adaptation to test our hypothesis that proficient blind readers develop ‘tactile word form areas’ TWFAs in
posterior parietal cortex and connected dorsal occipital areas. Aim 2 tests the prediction that individual
differences in the connectivity (dMRI) and functional specialization of parietal areas predicts individual
differences in reading proficiency among congenitally and late blind adults, whereas individual differences in
early visual areas only predict individual differences in the congenitally blind population. Aim 3 tests the key
prediction that TWFA specialization and Braille-reading associated connectivity changes emerge as a result of
literacy by working with congenitally blind children (dMRI and fMRI) longitudinally, as they learn to read.
Uncovering neural markers of successful Braille literacy will test theories of human brain plasticity and facilitate
and inform strategies for enhancing Braille literacy among people who are blind."

Obesity has reached pandemic levels in the United States and will soon surpass smoking as the number one
cause of preventable cancer. Understanding how to best treat obese cancer patients is a critical unmet need.
Preclinical data from our lab show increased resistance to radiotherapy (RT) in obese mouse cancer models.
Clinical data demonstrates that obese cancer patients are more resistant to radiotherapy and have higher rates
of recurrence. Very few mechanistic studies have addressed these findings and understanding the mechanisms
governing radiotherapy resistance in obesity is a gap in knowledge. Our prior studies demonstrate that obesity,
likely via leptin, a hormone elevated in obesity, can alter the proliferation / survival of cancers and also change
the immune response to cancer, leading to changes in the efficacy of cancer therapies. Obesity suppresses
adaptive T cell anti-tumor immunity and the immune system strongly contributes to the anti-tumor effects of RT,
providing a potential mechanism linking obesity and RT resistance. Obesity related adipokines can induce anti-
apoptotic factors and RT resistance. Based on these observations we hypothesize that obesity induces
resistance to RT directly by increasing anti-apoptotic factors in cancer cells and indirectly by inducing
suppression of adaptive anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We also hypothesize
that leptin signaling may mediate the RT resistance observed in obesity. This proposal seeks to test these
hypotheses and further delineate mechanistic links between obesity and RT resistance using three specific aims.
We will use lean and diet induced obesity (DIO) mouse models, immunosuppressed mice (Rag2 -/-), as well as
mice that lack functional leptin signaling (db/db) or lack endogenous leptin (ob/ob) to evaluate how obesity and
leptin signaling within cancer cells and within the tumor microenvironment influence resistance to radiotherapy.
In specific aim 1 we will examine the effects of obesity on the efficacy of RT and also examine the direct effects
on the tumor as well as the indirect effects via T cell dysfunction or other immune mechanisms. In specific aim
2 we will investigate leptin signaling as an underlying mechanism whereby obesity induces resistance to RT both
through direct effects on cancer cell proliferation / survival and also through indirect effects on the TME. In
specific aim 3 we will test an exploratory hypothesis that ablative RT is able to improve RT efficacy in obesity by
overcoming the mechanisms of obesity induced direct (but not immune related indirect) RT resistance.
Understanding how obesity impacts RT response and developing strategies to address these issues will
improve outcomes in obese patients treated with RT. Thus, these studies can have a major clinical impact
and represent a step towards personalized medicine by tailoring RT treatment strategies to a patient's metabolic
parameters."

Excessive white adipose tissue (WAT) is a hallmark of obesity and a causal factor for obesity-associated
disease. Adipose secretion of adipokines is also dysregulated in obesity, further impairing WAT crosstalk with
other tissues. Extensive research has been focused on gene transcriptions and protein posttranslational
modifications and substantially advanced our understanding of WAT growth and functions. Importantly, mRNA
connects the genetic control to translation of proteins responsible for cellular activities and functions. Like
protein modifications, RNA is also extensively and reversibly modified in its life cycle. N6-methyladenosine
(m6A) is the predominant RNA modification and catalyzed by a Mettl3/Mettl14 methyltransferase complex
(m6A writer). YTHD family proteins (m6A readers) bind to m6A-methylated RNAs and regulate pre-mRNA
splicing, nuclear export, decay, and/or translation of target transcripts. Global deletion of Mettl3, Mettl14, or
Ythdc1 results in embryonic/neonatal death in mice, demonstrating the essential role of the m6A system in
development and survival. However, m6A-based epitranscriptomic reprogramming has not been explored in
WAT, and there is a gap in our understanding of RNA modifications and metabolism in obesity. In the
preliminary study, we generated and characterized adipocyte-specific Mettl14 (Mettl14Δfat) and Ythdc1
(Ythdc1Δfat) knockout mice. Remarkably, both Mettl14Δfat and Ythdc1Δfat mice were resistant to diet-induced
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and liver steatosis. Gene expression analysis suggested that Mettl14 and Ythdc1
target the lipolysis machinery, β adrenergic signaling (stimulating lipolysis), insulin signaling (suppressing
lipolysis), and adipokine secretion. Consistently, WAT lipolysis was substantially elevated in Mettl14Δfat mice
and Ythdc1Δfat mice, particularly under β adrenergic-stimulated conditions, contributing to WAT reduction.
Adipose adiponectin expression was elevated in Mettl14Δfat and Ythdc1Δfat mice, contributing to improved
insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, and liver steatosis. We hypothesize that Mettl14 induces m6A
methylation selectively in mRNAs governing the lipolysis machinery, β adrenergic signaling, insulin signaling,
and adipokine expression. Ythdc1 directly binds to and regulates the metabolism (pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear
export, decay) of these m6A-modificed mRNAs, thereby guiding lipolysis, WAT growth, and adipokine-
mediated adipose crosstalk with other tissues. We will test this hypothesis in 3 Aims. Aim 1 is to determine
whether Mettl14 inhibits lipolysis and increases WAT expansion through RNA m6A methylation. Aim 2 is to
determine whether Ythdc1 suppresses lipolysis and promotes WAT expansion by regulating metabolism of its
bound RNAs. Aim 3 is to delineate whether Mettl14/Ythdc1 axis coordinates adipose crosstalk with other
tissues via adipokines. The outcomes are expected to establish a new adipose Mettl14/m6A/Ythdc1-based
epitranscriptomic reprogramming paradigm in obesity and metabolic disease."

A key feature in intestinal immunity is the dynamic intestinal barrier, which separates the host from resident and
pathogenic microbiota through a mucus gel impregnated with antimicrobial peptides. The mechanisms
underlying the maintenance and function of this intestinal barrier are not completely understood. Using a mouse
forward genetic screen for defects of intestinal homeostasis, we have found a mutation in Tvp23b, which
conferred susceptibility to both chemically induced and infectious colitis. Golgi apparatus membrane protein
TVP23 homolog B (TVP23B) is a transmembrane protein conserved from yeast to humans. In the intestine, the
protein is localized to the epithelium and its deficiency in the hematopoietic extrinsic compartment was essential
to the colitis phenotype. We found that TVP23B controls the homeostasis of Paneth cells and function of goblet
cells in vivo, leading to a decrease in antimicrobial peptides as well as a more penetrable mucus layer. As a
result, Tvp23b-/- mice displayed decreased barrier function and a loss of host-microbe separation. TVP23B-
deficient colonocytes have a loss of core-3 O-glycosylation of colonic proteins, which is the major O-glycosylation
present on gel forming mucins. TVP23B binds with another Golgi protein, YIPF6, which is similarly critical for
intestinal homeostasis. The Golgi proteomes of YIPF6 and TVP23B-deficient colonocytes have a common
deficiency of several critical glycosylation enzymes, including those necessary for core-3 glycosylation of mucins.
TVP23B is necessary for the formation of the sterile mucin layer of the intestine and its absence disturbs the
balance of host and microbe in vivo. In this proposal, we will examine the components that mediate the cellular
and molecular dysfunction in TVP23B deficiency and the resulting pathology in three Specific Aims: (1)
Determine the role of TVP23B in maintaining barrier function during infectious and chronic colitis (2) To examine
the role of TVP23B in intestinal secretory cell differentiation and intestinal regeneration. (3) To understand role
of TVP23B on Golgi enzyme trafficking. The aims in this proposal will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying
the mechanisms by which epithelial cells regulate host-microbe interactions."
10798155,"The goal of the U-RISE program at San Francisco State University (SFSU) is to develop a diverse pool of
scientists earning a PhD, who have the skills to successfully transition into careers in the biomedical research
workforce. San Francisco State University has dramatically increased the number of underrepresented (UR)
undergraduate students from SFSU that enter and succeed in PhD programs in the biomedical sciences during
the past 20 years of NIH support. Prior to the NIH funded training programs, only one SFSU UR undergraduate
student per decade entered a biomedically relevant PhD program. Today, every year more than 13
undergraduate UR SFSU students are being admitted into top PhD programs. We propose to continue our
successes in preparing SFSU U-RISE trainees for PhD programs in the biomedical sciences while embracing
the challenges associated with improving and enhancing our research and academic training effectiveness.
We will prepare 32 highly qualified underrepresented junior/senior students each year in a rigorous science
curriculum and provide them with high quality and stimulating research experiences. We will also provide
academic and professional skills activities to enhance competitiveness for PhD programs. To adapt to the
rapidly evolving biomedical research training landscape, we plan to continue to enhance these best practices
as the foundation for the seminars, workshops, science literacy and communication series, community building,
computational skills, and colloquium and honors courses in this new U-RISE program. In the proposed U-RISE
program we will focus on 1) improving and enhancing computational and quantitative skills, 2) strengthening
writing and science communication skills, and 3) expanding alumni networks and near-peer mentoring. To
achieve our overall training goals, we will pursue the following measurable objectives: Objective 1: At least
75% of participants will enter biomedical PhD programs. Objective 2: Ensure that U-RISE trainees are
progressing in the research and academic skills training that will enhance 1) success in completing an
undergraduate STEM degree and 2) success in PhD programs. Objective 3: Expand our academic and
scientific skills training to enhance competitiveness and success in biomedical PhD programs. Specifically,
training in computational and quantitative skills, enhancing scientific writing and communication skills, and
building a strong near-peer alumni network."
10798184,"An Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol/QGriffithsin (EEQ) IVR to Prevent Pregnancy and HIV
Several multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) have been advanced to prevent unintended pregnancy
and HIV. The current MPT development pipeline is dominated by antiretroviral (ARV) products with progestin-
only contraception using levonorgestrel. The Population Council, in collaboration with Oak Crest Institute of
Science (OCIS), proposes to develop a 90d pod-type IVR containing the progestin etonogestrel (ETG), the
estrogen ethinyl estradiol (EE), and the anti-HIV lectin QGriffithsin (QGRFT), hereafter referred to as the EEQ
IVR, to prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV. This product offers a highly effective contraceptive
combination (used in NuvaRing®) with the extremely potent and stable non-ARV anti-HIV lectin QGRFT. The
EEQ IVR offers significant advantages over ARV/progestin-only contraceptive products. It could reduce both
the emergence of drug-resistant HIV and the concern of potential increased risk of HIV transmission as well as
common irregular bleeding complaints associated with use of a progestin-only contraceptive. Aim 1: The
proposed product development plan for the EEQ IVR includes innovative formulation work involving pod IVR
designs and the use of silk fibroin to achieve QGRFT release for 90d. We will develop a scalable process to
manufacture an EEQ IVR. Aim 2: Two lead EEQ IVRs will be tested in
safety/pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies in rhesus macaques (RMs). We intend that the EEQ IVR
will be safe, deliver target API doses for 90d in vivo and demonstrate in vitro efficacy against HIV/SHIV AD8.
Based on these studies, the lead RM IVR will be selected and advanced to in vivo efficacy studies in RMs. We
postulate that the EEQ IVR will be efficacious against SHIV AD8 in vivo and will not drive resistance. Aim 3:
We will conduct a pilot study among 24 US couples to compare adherence, preference and acceptability of 3
placebo silicone IVRs of different external diameters (46mm, 56mm and 66mm) to inform the design of the
EEQ IVR. Using a 3-way crossover study design, we will identify the external IVR diameter associated with
greatest adherence and preference to inform the final EEQ IVR design. The EEQ IVR has the potential to
significantly improve women’s health and advance the MPT and drug delivery fields. The EEQ IVR would be
the first non-ARV MPT for women at high risk for both unintended pregnancy and HIV acquisition."

Statistics fundamentally transformed the practice of and meaning of medicine in the twentieth century.
Though insurers and public health reformers had relied on actuarial and statistical calculations for
years, formal statistical tests and measures were rarely found in the medical literature in the 1930s. Just
a half century later, however, statistical calculations had become essential for clinicians and patients
seeking to measure the efficacy of new drugs, choose among treatment options, establish clinical
practice guidelines, recommend screening tests, or assess the carcinogenicity of everyday exposures.
Statistically-driven innovations such as randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, n-of-1 and adaptive
trials, as well as prospective and retrospective studies have become central tools of modern medicine.
Yet we know surprisingly little about the emergence of biostatistics and the related field of clinical
epidemiology. Most existing histories of medicine have noted the rise of statistically-interpreted trials
as a strategy of physician-reformers looking to reduce the role of bias and subjectivity in medicine but
historians have yet to seriously engage with the technical transformations that enabled what was once
a field of averages and aggregation (and mainly of use to epidemiologists) to be applicable to decision
making at an individual (clinical) level. This transformation was controversial, and faced resistance
from many quarters, but particularly from surgical and other procedure-heavy specialties. This grant
will support production of a monograph, Number Doctors: The Emergence of Biostatistics and the
Reformation of Modern Medicine, that will reframe our understanding of how statistics and statisticians
came to play a transformative role in modern medicine. The monograph will partially center on a
group of biostatisticians hired in 1947 under sociologist Harold Dorn at the National Cancer Institute,
but that soon worked across the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies, including the
Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and Heath, Education, and Welfare.
Other chapters will trace the spread of statistical measures from population genetics and agriculture to
biostatistics and clinical epidemiology programs at universities as well as the development of
specialized journals and professional organizations. The final chapters will trace the origins of now-
common tools like metanalysis and simulation modeling. Drawing on archival materials as well as
accounts of medical reformers, the resulting monograph will be the first extended history of
biostatistics and clinical epidemiology, and will contribute to larger discussions about the role of data,
risk calculations, and the meaning of “evidence-based” and “precision” medicine."
10798304,"ABSTRACT
Reactive lymphangiogenesis requires B cell-expressed lymphotoxin (LT)α. LTα signals through TNFR1 or
TNFR2 when it is presented to cells as a LTα3 homotrimer, or it signals through LTβR when it is part of the
LTa1b2 heterotrimeric complex. Lymphangitis has been described as a feature of Crohn's disease, but the
nature and role of lymphangitis in the disease has not been elucidated. In resected tissue from Crohn's
disease patients, outflow lymphatic trunks (called collecting lymphatic vessels) running from the ileum through
the mesentery and on to draining lymph nodes appeared obstructed by tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) that
formed around them. The TLOs were rich in B cells. In a mouse model of ileitis driven by a mutation in the
mRNA locus for the cytokine TNF (TNF∆ARE mice) that increases TNF abundance when the gene is
environmentally triggered, TLOs developed along mesenteric collecting lymphatics draining the ileum, like
patients. The mice display marked blockade of lymph flow due to obstruction by the TLOs, which raised lymph
pressure so that flow did not move forward but pushed backwards through lymphatic collaterals toward the gut.
Backflow characterizes compromised valves. Indeed, TLOs mainly formed where lymphatic valves lost their
identity and quiescence. Instead, these valve sites supported lymphangiogenesis that partially encapsulated
expanding TLOs. Before lymphangiogenesis got underway, B cells accumulated around lymphatic valves.
These B cells may be the source of cytokines that act on the lymphatic vessels. Indeed, data so far suggest
that the action of TNF on lymphatic endothelium may be sufficient in vitro and in vivo to reprogram valve-
associated genes critical to the maintenance of normal lymph flow. That is, early blockade with anti-TNF
neutralizing mAb restores lymph flow and prevents progression of TLOs. At late stages in disease, anti-TNF
therapy becomes less effective as the TLOs have greatly expanded and enlarged, but nonetheless anti-TNF
still partially restores mesenteric lymph flow, suggesting that TNF remains a key, and possibly required, signal
in disease progression. However, it remains unclear if the TLOs per se drive worsened ileitis. What would
happen if the TLOs did not form but other inflammatory pathways were left intact? In preliminary data for this
application, we have identified a means to prevent TLO formation: TLOs do not form in the absence of B cells.
Furthermore, TNF and/or LTα expressed by B cells is required for the formation of TLOs in the ileitis-affected
mesentery of TNFARE mice. These data cause us to hypothesize that TNF receptor ligands TNF and/or LTα
derived from B cells act through TNF receptors on lymphatic endothelium to drive tertiary lymphoid organ
(TLO) formation by skewing signals that normally maintain lymphatic valve integrity. We predict, in turn, that
TLOs govern the pathophysiology of the disease itself by trapping inflammatory cells and mediators rather than
allowing such mediators to disseminate and enhance systemic pathology. This model predicts a Catch-22
feature of TLOs: they protect against some forms of pathology but drive others."

 Of the thousands of children with cardiac arrests annually, more than half do not survive. In
hospitalized children, cardiac arrest results from the progression of many disease processes. Targeting these
processes through physiology-directed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a promising means of
personalizing resuscitation to improve survival outcomes. One particularly challenging physiologic process in
children with cardiac arrest is pulmonary hypertension (PH). Based on preliminary data, it appears that by
limiting pulmonary blood flow during CPR, PH impedes cardiac output and leads to lower systemic blood
pressures, values of which are correlated with survival outcomes. Despite consensus opinion that PH-
associated pediatric cardiac arrest is tied to worse outcomes and the American Heart Association and
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation identifying it as a significant knowledge gap, there is a
paucity of high-quality data on the topic. Our preliminary clinical data indicates that PH is present in 18-35% of
children prior to cardiac arrest. Moreover, PH physiology may be present in far more patients during cardiac
arrest due to the detrimental effects of acidosis and hypoxemia on the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, we
performed a randomized and blinded trial of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a pulmonary vasodilator, during CPR
in a swine model of PH-associated cardiac arrest and demonstrated higher blood pressures and improved rates
of survival with iNO. Thus, there is a readily available potential therapeutic for this serious problem, but
dedicated clinical study is necessary.
 The scientific objectives of this application are to delineate the epidemiology of PH-associated pediatric
in-hospital cardiac arrest and to quantify the physiologic effects of PH and of iNO treatment during CPR. Two
prospective observational cohort studies will be performed. The first will utilize the infrastructure of an
ongoing R01-funded prospective cardiac arrest trial to report on survival from PH-associated cardiac arrest
and the association of PH with intra-arrest hemodynamics. The second will take place in a single center with
extensive, high-fidelity physiology data-capturing systems to better define the physiologic effects of iNO
therapy during CPR. The successful completion of these studies will form the foundation of our knowledge on
this understudied problem and inform the design of prospective clinical trials to treat it. The candidate, Dr.
Ryan Morgan, is a pediatric intensivist and Assistant Professor at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
University of Pennsylvania. His goal is to become an independent, patient-oriented investigator studying
pediatric cardiac arrest and the tailoring of resuscitation therapies to patient-specific physiology. Through the
proposed studies, the parallel career development plan, a team of dedicated and experienced mentors and
advisors, and a world-class environment for resuscitation science at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
University of Pennsylvania, this award will facilitate the candidate's successful transition to independence."

One of the grand challenges in cancer research is the vast heterogeneity in responsiveness to treatment for
different cancer types. We have made great strides in treating some cancers, while the prognosis for others
remains dismal. Large scale whole genome sequence (WGS) analyses have identified “breakpoint signatures”
of different cancer types that presumably reflect heterogeneity in their underlying disrupted pathways but, drug-
gable targets have emerged only in cases where the breaks create oncogenic fusion proteins. The ability to
predict disrupted pathways using WGS would be highly impactful for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Chromo-
some fragile sites (FSs) manifest as gaps and breaks in metaphase chromosomes when cultured cells experi-
ence replication stress. However, many FSs are not cancer-type specific and many breakpoint hotspots in cancer
are not known FSs, which has severely limited the impact of the FS field. Since cultured cells offer the potential
to prospectively dissect mechanisms initiating chromosome breaks and to track their expansion into complex
structural variation, there is a critical need to make these in vitro systems more cancer relevant. Our longterm
goal is to establish a sustained research strategy that can predict which known pathways are disrupted in a given
cancer type from their breakpoint patterns. The overall objective of this proposal is to reveal mechanisms by
which perturbation of cancer-relevant cellular pathways produce pathway-specific patterns of FSs in cell culture
and determine whether those patterns can be identified in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that the power of
in vitro systems to dissect mechanisms leading to cancer breakpoint signatures will become evident only when
shifted away from chemically-induced FSs towards FSs induced by perturbing known cancer-relevant pathways.
We have shown that overexpression of different oncogenes leads to oncogene-specific spectra of FSs and pre-
liminary data suggest some of the mechanisms by which this occurs. Our rationale is that understanding cancer-
relevant mechanisms that specify FSs will fill the gap in linking in vitro FSs to cancer breakpoints. This would be
a major step toward a strategy to predict disrupted pathways from cancer WGS data, thereby suggesting treat-
ments for previously intractable cancers. Aim1 will use high throughput/resolution replication and Oligopaints
assays to identify downstream mechanisms distinguishing which of many sites of oncogene-induced replication
delay manifest as FSs. Aim2 will elucidate upstream mechanisms causing replication delays and FS at specific
sites. Aim3 will map FSs at unprededented resolution and mine tumor sequencing databases for signatures that
match those of oncogene-specific FSs. This contribution will be significant because the ability to identify affected
pathways solely from breakpoint signatures would expose tumor-specific vulnerabilities for precision cancer
medicine. The proposed research is innovative because it will rejuvenate the impact of FS research, closing the
gap between in vitro systems and in vivo cancers while leveraging novel technologies to manipulate cells, map
their signatures of genome instability and match them to cancer breakpoint signatures."

In Nigeria, cancer is a significant and growing public health threat. Given the rising incidence and poor
outcomes associated with cancer in the region, the Nigerian Ministry of Health has designated cancer
as a priority area for research and training. To support this, we propose a new training program – the
Nigerian Cancer Research Training (NCAT) program – with the goal of increasing capacity for cancer
research in Nigeria. We seek to not only strengthen the existing research enterprise but to build in-
country expertise and provide a solid foundation for the development, implementation, and
dissemination of evidence-based interventions that will impact public health policy, as well as clinical
practice, care, and treatment for cancer patients. The NCAT program will build on existing relationships
and infrastructure established over the past decade between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSK) in the US, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Nigeria, and the College of Medicine/Lagos
University Teaching Hospital (CMUL/LUTH) in Nigeria. We will employ a multi-level approach to
strengthen research capacity for individuals (Aim 1) and institutions (Aim 2), while also enhancing
broader relationships at national, regional, and global levels (Aim 3). The NCAT program will address
two distinct needs for cancer research training in Nigeria: 1. a training program that can be used for
clinical faculty (primarily physicians and nurses) that will not interfere with clinical/research duties, and
2. a training program to bolster the capacity of full-time PhD-level researchers in the disciplines of
cancer epidemiology, behavioral sciences, and biostatistics. Trainees will be competitively selected,
and we will emphasize diversity and underrepresented specialties (e.g., nursing, psycho-oncology). A
multi-pronged training approach, utilizing coursework, “hands-on” research in ongoing breast and
colorectal cancer studies, virtual learning, mentorship, and collaboration will be used to train a cadre of
multidisciplinary Nigerian cancer researchers. After a one-year cancer research training period, NCAT
trainees will be grouped into research teams and take part in team science-based training, which will
include designing and conducting a collaborative mentored pilot research project in Nigeria. In addition,
to enhance support for local researchers beyond the project period, we will develop cancer research
training courses to be used in Nigeria, and provide mentorship and training to research administration
offices at OAU and CMUL/LUTH. We will use multiple layers of trainee and project assessment to
ensure that our program is meeting its ultimate goal of creating well-trained colorectal and breast cancer

 Age is the major risk factor for most chronic human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neural
stem cells (NSCs) are particularly vulnerable to cellular aging and undergo functional decay in the mature
brain. As a result, adult neurogenesis and its contributions to memory in health and AD are compromised at
early ages. A central goal in regenerative medicine for AD is to determine the factors that rejuvenate
endogenous NSCs and augment cognition. Yet, NSCs are commonly perceived to be a poor target for anti-
aging interventions. A daunting challenge remains for NSC rejuvenation: to restore older NSC proliferation,
increase their numbers, alter NSC fate for neurogenesis and sustain these changes.
 Systems biology offers a potential solution by integrating information from multiple fields. We propose to
develop computational network and pharmacogenomics approaches to prioritize and modulate key age-related
changes for NSC rejuvenation. Our prior work utilized single cell transcriptomics to define molecular cascades
that initiate adult neurogenesis and are compromised during aging. Preliminary data now identifies a new
transition signature that distinguishes quiescent from active NSCs and is altered with age. Our new single cell
pharmacogenomics approach utilizes the transition signature to identify a compound that rejuvenates NSC
function by expanding the NSC pool, increasing neurogenesis and sustaining NSC proliferation. Animal
behavioral studies also demonstrate improved cognition in older mice. Thus, data detailed in this proposal
strongly suggests we can apply combined “omics” approaches to reprogram older NSC function and provide a
new understanding of adult neurogenesis in aging. The mechanisms mediating this NSC reprogramming
remain enigmatic. We will advance the new pharmacogenomics with systems biology techniques in network
connectivity and co-expression to prioritize mechanisms by which NSC aging is reversed (Aim 1), older NSC
function is augmented (Aim 2) and how these changes are sustained (Aim 3).
 Together, this study will reveal evidence of NSC rejuvenation and demonstrate proof-of-principle utility of
new single cell pharmacogenomics and gene networks for enhancing neurogenesis in the aged hippocampus.
These results would provide a paradigm shift in NSC capacity for regeneration, as well as mechanistic insight
into NSC vulnerability to aging, resilience to their decline, and building cognitive reserve."

Candidate. Christopher Chesley, MD, MSCE, is a pulmonary and critical care physician and health equity
researcher who is committed to eliminating disparities related to acute respiratory failure (ARF) and sepsis. To
promote development toward research independence, he seeks guided training to facilitate mastery of advanced
causal effect methodology, qualitative study design, and system-wide intervention development.
Research context. Inequitable clinical outcomes are well documented for minoritized patients with ARF and
sepsis, but interventions mitigating them are lacking. In part, this is due to a limited understanding of the salient
mechanisms most influential to disparities. Among them, harms mediated through socioeconomic disadvantage
(defined as access to poor quality socioeconomic resources) and care characteristics related to hospitals that
serve the largest proportions of minority patients (often described as minority serving hospitals, or MSHs) are
particularly likely to play causal roles. Thus, this proposal aims to clarify the mechanistic roles of these
underexplored determinants of health disparities in the context of ARF and sepsis.
Specific aims. 1) Characterize the mechanistic role of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage on clinical
outcome disparities among critically ill patients; 2) Describe clinical processes that influence length of stay
disparities for critically ill patients hospitalized at MSHs; and 3) Identify perceived barriers and facilitators of
implementing an intervention to reduce hospital readmissions among critically ill patients at MSHs.
Research plan. Dr. Chesley will examine relationships between minority identity and clinical outcomes of
200,000 patients across 16 U.S. hospitals. After geocoding four clinically impactful forms of neighborhood-level
socioeconomic disadvantage, he will use mediation analyses to elucidate causal roles for these measures. Then,
adapting research frameworks from human factors and ergonomics, he will describe the clinical processes that
most strongly influence hospital length of stay disparities using semi-structured interviews and direct observation
of clinical activities. Lastly, he will conduct semi-structured interviews to identify barriers and facilitators to
implementing a systems intervention recommended by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Career development plan. Working closely with his mentors and advisors, Dr. Chesley will 1) enhance his
mastery of quantitative methods, with emphasis on causal effect methodology and geospatial mapping; 2)
develop comprehensive skills in qualitative and mixed-methods study design; and 3) become proficient in
developing and testing health systems-level, disparities-mitigating interventions.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania offers an ideal environment to pursue this training, with well-
established mentors, a home department heavily dedicated to Dr. Chesley’s success, and several multi-
disciplinary research centers with long track records of producing successful, independent investigators."

With no FDA-approved medications available to address stimulant use disorders (StUD) and rising prevalence
of stimulants nationally, contingency management (CM) has gained attention as one of few effective treatment
options. Despite growing clinical interest in CM, implementation barriers pose substantial challenges to
moving this evidence-based intervention into routine use. Chief among these concerns is lack of
reimbursement pathways and difficulty implementing CM with fidelity (Rash et al., 2012, 2020). Prescription
Digital Therapeutics, mobile app based products that are FDA-cleared for the treatment of disease, have shown
promise in overcoming reimbursement challenges by taking advantage of existing formulary billing pathways
for drugs and medical devices. Also, delivery of CM through an app addresses many of the barriers of
day-to-day implementation within the clinical workflow, maintains protocol adherence, and improves patient
access–making it more likely to be adopted and impactful. Therefore, DynamiCare Health has developed and
piloted DCH-003, a digital therapeutic delivering CM and other evidence-based modalities for the treatment of
StUD. Unlike competitor products that include CM such as the PDT reSET from Pear Therapeutics, DCH-003
fully automates CM through remote, random, self-administered rapid saliva tests witnessed over selfie video,
and is designed as a full year program (vs. 90 days). DCH-003 also incorporates evidence-based, self-guided
therapy modules, appointment tracking, and delivers rewards via a risk-protective smart debit card. The
product promises greater accessibility and fidelity to CM, and ultimately greater impact on StUD than currently
available treatments. This study proposes a Phase II, two-group, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that will
provide the necessary efficacy data in order to seek FDA clearance of DCH-003 for the treatment of StUD.
Patients with StUD (N = 270) will be randomized to: a) Intervention: standard clinic care plus DCH-003 or b)
Control: standard clinic care plus a time- and effort-controlled sham digital app (to control for placebo effect).
The primary outcome will be the percent stimulant abstinent samples collected during weeks 1-38. Secondary
outcomes include other clinically relevant indicators (abstinence from other illicit substances, treatment
retention, long-term (weeks 39-64) percent negative samples). Aim 1 compares DCH-003 to sham control, and
we expect better clinical outcomes in the intervention vs. control group. Aim 2 compares healthcare utilization
and costs between the groups, with the goal of payer adoption post-FDA-clearance. Importantly, this study will
be the first RCT for DCH-003 (essential for FDA clearance), and, more broadly, it addresses a critical next step
in the translation of science to clinical practice that is vital for driving adoption of this proven, effective
paradigm into routine care amidst a U.S. stimulant epidemic."

Hearing impairment is a common and disabling sensory defect which in a subset of individuals can be due to an
abnormal cochleovestibular anatomy. Cochleovestibular (CV) and cochleovestibular nerve (CVN) anomalies can
significantly impact a child’s development and currently pose challenges in treatment and management. Little
research has been done to understand the etiology of these malformations, especially those that are non-
syndromic and severe, such as cochlear aplasia. There is a crucial need to better understand the underlying
molecular mechanisms of these conditions to aid in diagnosis, intervention and management. In addition, health
disparities exist in the molecular diagnosis and treatment of hearing impairment (HI) in Hispanics, as the
molecular etiology of HI has been scarcely studied in this ethnic group. It is imperative to study the etiology of
CV/CVN anomalies in diverse racial/ethnic populations to understand which genes/variants are a frequent cause
of this disorder in each population. Molecular diagnostics and treatment can therefore be tailored based on
population-specific information.
We hypothesize that a significant subset of severe non-syndromic CV/CVN anomalies has a genetic etiology,
which may differ between populations, and knowledge of this information will improve our understanding of inner
ear development. Our preliminary research suggests that rare genetic variants, including de novo variants, are
implicated in the development of severe CV/CVN anomalies. Our proposal leverages genomics data and
temporal bone imaging data to unravel the molecular basis of non-syndromic CV/CVN malformations. To achieve
this, we will 1) recruit and establish a large genomic database of racially/ethnically diverse families with CV/CVN
malformations which have been phenotyped in detail. 2) Next, we will determine the genetic spectrum of
underlying variation implicated in CV/CVN malformations in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals. 3) Last,
using recruited and existing cohorts of individuals with CV/CVN malformations and prelingual sensorineural
hearing impairment, we will identify novel causal genes implicated in CV/CVN malformations and assess their
expression during early craniofacial and inner ear development.
We have assembled a team that has the collective expertise to achieve these aims as well as a prior track record
of productive collaboration. This work will elucidate the genetic architecture of severe non-syndromic CV/CVN
malformations diverse ethnic/racial populations and improve our basic knowledge of human inner ear
development and the mechanisms leading to abnormal development. This knowledge can then be used to
improve molecular diagnostics, guide therapeutic intervention and management, predict outcomes, and develop
novel therapeutic approaches benefiting individuals of diverse ethnicity/racial background."

Dopamine is an important neuromodulator and pathologies in dopamine signaling are a hallmark of brain
disease. Despite these roles, the organization and regulation of dopamine signaling are incompletely understood.
The long-term goal of this project is to dissect the cell biology of axonal dopamine transmission.
Spatial and temporal features of dopamine signaling are different from synaptic transmission. At conventional
synapses, nanometer-scale synaptic structure enables robust receptor activation at sub-millisecond speeds and
restricts communication to point-to-point contacts between select neurons. In contrast, dopamine is a volume
transmitter that diffuses through the extracellular space after exocytosis and may influence many cells through
G-protein coupled receptors. These properties suggest that dopamine transmission is slow and diffuse. Recent
data from several laboratories, including some generated during the previous funding cycle, however, have
revealed that dopamine transmission is highly dynamic and, in some cases, remarkably precise. Furthermore,
dopamine release is powerfully and rapidly regulated by local cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. These
findings suggest that the coding of dopamine volume transmission is more precise than previously thought.
A major question that arises is how the architecture for dopamine transmission can support precise
signaling. Our overarching model is that molecular machinery has evolved to support broad dopamine coding
scales. We build on our previous findings that axonal dopamine exocytosis is executed with millisecond precision
by sparse, sophisticated protein machinery typically present at synapses. In aim 1, we zoom in on the powerful
local regulation and ask how cholinergic neurons trigger dopamine release. Based on preliminary data, we
hypothesize that activity in cholinergic interneurons induces ectopic action potential firing in dopamine axons to
trigger dopamine secretion. Our goal is to test this hypothesis and to understand the underlying mechanisms.
Identification of an endogenous mechanism for ectopic axonal action potential initiation away from the dopamine
neuron soma has important implications for dopamine neuron function. In aim 2, we dissect the organization
of dopamine receptors relative to release sites. We build on recent work that identified markers for these
sparse secretory sites. Our preliminary data reveal that dopamine receptors are clustered one to two micrometers
away from release sites and suggest differences in D1 vs. D2 receptor distributions. We will systematically
assess release-receptor organization in super-resolved 3D-images of large striatal volumes and will
mechanistically dissect how it is set up. We propose that the organization is different from nanoscale synaptic
structure and from the diffuse organization often associated with volume transmission, and may be suited to
mediate distinct pathway activation by switches in dopamine neuron firing modes.
Our work will dissect the organization of specialized dopamine signaling architecture and rapid, local
triggering mechanisms of dopamine release in the vertebrate striatum."

This project will study how exposure to climatic variability (i.e., temperature and precipitation anomalies) during
different phases of the life course, from early childhood through adulthood, affect older adults’ health,
economic status, and migration behaviors. We draw on data from the Indonesian and Mexican Family Life
Surveys to measure three health outcomes (body mass index, hemoglobin, and blood pressure), consumption
expenditures, and lifetime migration status among adults aged 50+ years in Indonesia (~36,000 observations
from ~17,000 individuals) and Mexico (~19,400 observations from ~13,100 individuals). We link these
demographic records to high-resolution climate data, and measure individuals’ climate exposures during early
childhood (ages -1 to 5), adolescence (ages 12 to 18), and early adulthood (ages 19 to 25). We fit a series of
fixed effects regression models to measure the independent effects of climate exposures during the three focal
critical periods, while controlling for relevant demographic characteristics and spatial and temporal
confounders. We then evaluate whether and how climate effects vary by age, sex, and rural (urban) residence
at birth, all of which we expect to be correlated with climate vulnerability. Our third set of analyses evaluate
whether exposure to recurring shocks from early childhood through adulthood have compounding and (or)
cumulative effects on health in older adulthood. We also perform a series of supplemental analyses that test
the robustness of our findings to alternative data and measurement decisions and compare the effects of
earlier-life and contemporaneous shocks on health in later life. This study provides new evidence about the
links between climate change and older adults’ demographic and health outcomes in the developing world,
where the severity of climate change and extent of population aging are expected to increase in the decades
ahead."

Surgery is a pivotal life event during which the acuity and imminence of surgical risk can motivate patients to
make major changes to behaviors and lifestyle factors to optimize surgical health. Preoperative alcohol
consumption (>2 drinks a day) is a common surgical risk factor linked to increased postoperative
complications. Appropriately timed interventions could promote short- and long-term alcohol use reduction and
prevent excess surgical morbidity and mortality. However, the dearth of research in this area limits our ability to
intervene effectively or leverage motivation at critical time points. This study uses a sequential, multiple
assignment, randomized trial (SMART) to test the efficacy of adaptive interventions for elective surgical
patients reporting high-risk alcohol use. These adaptive interventions use decision rules at critical points during
the surgical episode of care to modify treatment type and intensity based on early treatment response. The
specific aims are: 1) Test the efficacy of adaptive interventions that begin with preoperative ‘Virtual Coaching’
relative to Enhanced Usual Care on reducing alcohol use, surgical complications, and hospital length of stay;
and 2) Identify the most efficacious second-stage intervention to sustained alcohol use reduction after surgery
among early treatment responders and non-responders. Elective surgical patients (N = 440) will be
randomized before surgery to either Virtual Coaching or Enhanced Usual Care. Initial treatment response will
be assessed at the 2-month follow up for the perioperative period. Early responders (i.e., abstinence or low-risk
alcohol use) will be re-randomized to postoperative strategies, either continued Virtual Coaching or stepped
down to Usual Care. Early non-responders (i.e., not abstinent or low risk drinking), will be re-randomized to
alternative postoperative strategies, either ‘On-track,’ a mobile health intervention that incorporates self-
monitoring and progress feedback, or a combined intervention (Virtual Coaching + On-Track). Outcomes will
be measured at 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups and via electronic health records. Secondary aims are: 1)
Identify the best performing adaptive interventions; and 2) Identify baseline and time varying moderators of
intervention efficacy. Results of this study will have wide-ranging implications for innovating and moving
beyond static alcohol interventions in healthcare settings and will advance surgical health optimization
research. This study is consistent with the priorities of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
which seeks to advance addiction health services by integrating alcohol treatment into mainstream healthcare,
thereby improving access and decreasing stigma. The adaptive interventions developed in this study enables
real-time treatment tailoring based on individual’s response to first stage interventions, a critical advance in
care consistent with national precision health priorities which seek to tailor treatment to individual needs."

Spike-Wave Discharges (SWDs) are a common type of seizure in the Genetic Generalized Epilepsies (GGEs).
Hyperventilation triggers SWDs in the overwhelming majority of patients with absence epilepsy, the most
common form of pediatric GGE. We have recently developed a rodent epilepsy model wherein we can evoke a
burst of SWDs with hyperventilation. Within 6 minutes of hyperventilation, SWD count increases by over 500%.
We now leverage this model to gain unprecedented access to core seizure-generating mechanisms associated
with SWDs.
By combining plethysmography, EEG and blood measurements in single animals, we show that SWD circuits
appear critically sensitive to blood pH. First, we show that hypoxia, a condition that activates hyperventilation,
robustly evokes rodent SWDs. Hypoxia-induced hyperventilation results in increased exhalation of CO2 and
concomitant blood alkalization (i.e. respiratory alkalosis). We also show that hypoxia-evoked SWDs are
abolished when atmospheric CO2 is elevated, thereby supporting the hypothesis that blood alkalization drives
hyperventilation-evoked SWDs. Finally, we also show that optogenetic activation of hyperventilation during
normal atmospheric conditions – an experimental procedure that reduces blood CO2 but increases O2 – also
evokes SWDs. Thus, collectively our data show that SWDs appear to primarily covary with blood CO2.
We complement our plethysmography-EEG data with brain slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging. We
focus our attention on the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus because activity-dependent cell tagging
approaches (i.e. cFos) consistently label cells within this region after hypoxia-induced hyperventilation. By using
whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques we demonstrate that intralaminar thalamic cells produce
depolarizing ionic currents during alkalized conditions. A significant portion of this current appears to be mediated
by enhanced excitatory synaptic drive.
With our preliminary data, we now present a project that aims to test the overarching hypothesis that activation
of pH-sensitive intralaminar thalamic neurons by acute respiratory alkalosis precipitates absence
seizures. Identifying these neurons and their mechanisms of activation will inform new strategies to treat the
most common pediatric GGEs, disorders for which only decades-old, sub-optimal treatments exist. We
specifically test the following main hypotheses:
  Aim 1 Respiratory alkalosis triggers absence seizures.
  Aim 2 Spontaneous and hyperventilation-triggered seizures utilize the same neural ciruitry.
When complete, we expect that the results of our project will provide significant, new insights into fundamental
cellular- and circuit-level mechanisms that drive generalized spike-wave discharges, and therefore pave new
avenues for generalized epilepsy treatments."

Millions of people throughout the world are exposed to arsenic, through their drinking water and food, at
concentrations above the current US EPA standard. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that exposure is
associated with changes locomotor activity, muscular strength, and neuropathy of the peripheral nervous
system. One important functions of motor neurons in the peripheral nervous system is to synthesize and
secrete the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to regulate skeletal muscle contraction. Studies have assessed
changes in brain acetylcholine levels in response to arsenic exposure, but its levels in motor neurons have not
been investigated.
We conducted preliminary studies exposing human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to arsenic for up to 28
days during their differentiation into mature motor neurons. Exposure to arsenic reduced transcript levels of
stage specific motor neuron markers, reduced neurite length, but increased the number of neurites. Additional
data from these studies suggest that neurotransmitter vesicular transport is impaired.
The work in this proposal will ascertain the mechanisms by which arsenic can impair motor neuron formation
and can alter cholinergic neurotransmitter production and function. In the first aim, we will pulse expose iPS
cells to human-relevant concentrations of arsenic during their differentiation into cholinergic motor neurons,
with the goal of assessing the dose-response, time course, and stage specificity of arsenic. In the second aim,
we will explore changes in neurotransmitter uptake and release is a mechanism responsible for the aberrant
differentiation. These studies will further our understanding of how arsenic impairs cellular differentiation and
may suggest a mechanism for the neuropathy and muscle weakness noted in human epidemiological studies."

This exploratory project is a collaboration between researchers studying arousal-related behavioral states and
BRAIN tool developers and will utilize novel interventional tools for changing neural circuit dynamics to elucidate
the hierarchical organization of hypocretin (Hcrt) circuits with respect to arousal and reward. Motivated behaviors
are fundamentally linked to arousal; however, little is known about the neural mechanisms that couple
motivational processes with sleep/wake regulation. The hypothalamic Hcrt neurons play a central role as a hub
integrating sensory and physiological information to tune arousal-related behavioral states, and deficiencies in
these circuitries contribute to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Hcrt neurons project throughout the brain,
with specially dense excitatory projections to brain areas regulating arousal (e.g., locus coeruleus, LC) and
reward (e.g., ventral tegmental area, VTA). To understand the relevance of individual projections in arousal and
reward we will functionally interrogate projection-selective subsets of Hcrt neurons. Our hypothesis is that
selective manipulation of synaptic drive of Hcrt neurons towards subpopulations of neurons in key brain
structures mediating arousal (LC) versus reward (VTA) will reveal functional diversity rather than dichotomy. Our
major goal will be to determine if lateral hypothalamus Hcrt projections to noradrenergic LC neurons are sufficient
to enhance brain reward (Aim 1) and projections to dopaminergic VTA neurons are sufficient for arousal state
transitions (Aim 2). For manipulation of neuronal activity this project will employ the bioluminescent optogenetic
(BL-OG) platform that employs light emitting luciferases to activate light sensing opsins. Using a novel trans-
synaptic bioluminescent optogenetic strategy, Interluminescence, Hcrt neurons will express a presynaptic
vesicle targeted luciferase, while opsin expression is restricted to specific postsynaptic neurons in target areas.
In this “optical synapse” light emission from luciferases by peripheral luciferin administration will modulate the
synaptic activity of highly selective projections. The impact of projection-specific interventions on reward behavior
and sleep-to-wake transition will be evaluated using established behavioral tests. A deeper understanding of
how the outputs of Hcrt neurons are functionally organized and their individual effects on behavioral transitions
will be highly significant as several Hcrt receptor antagonists have been approved for the treatment of insomnia
and are being tested in clinical trials to reduce cravings in substance abuse disorder. Learning about the relative
weight of Hcrt projections to LC compared with VTA may lead to optimization of these treatments and to
therapeutic opportunities in substance abuse, eating and panic disorders, cognitive disruption and emotion-
related disorders including anxiety, MDD and PTSD."

Our long-term goal is to understand steroid regulation of social interaction by studying limbic-hypothalamic
neural circuits that control female sexually receptivity, lordosis. We demonstrated that within this circuit,
estradiol membrane-initiated signaling activates an arcuate nucleus (ARH) to medial preoptic nucleus
(MPN) projection responsible for transient μ-opioid receptor (MORs) activation needed for full sexual
receptivity. These MOR neurons in turn project to the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH)
modulating lordosis behavior. The present proposal is based on these results and on results in male mice
that show that the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MeApd) modulates social behavior. Because in females,
MeApd projections affecting the social behavior, lordosis, are not well defined, we seek to characterize
specific MeApd projections that modulate the ARH-MPN-VMH circuit underlying steroid activation of female
sexual receptivity. We will test the general hypothesis that the MeApd gates estradiol-initiated opioid
inhibition to modulate sexual receptivity. Three Specific Aims are proposed to functionally dissect this
circuit: 1) Selective activation of intrinsic ARH NPY neurons, and MPN-projecting POMC terminals inhibit
lordosis. This experiment formally tests that the sequential activation of NPY and POMC neurons inhibits
lordosis. NPY-Cre and POMC-Cre neurons will be infected with a stimulatory Cre-dependent
channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus (AAV) and photostimulated in behaving female mice. 2)
The MeApd differentially modulates sexual receptivity through glutamatergic projections to the MPN, and
GABAergic to the VMH. We will use AAV-directed expression of ChR2, to stimulate, or halorhodopsin, to
inhibit, glutamatergic and GABAergic MeApd outputs. Our expectation is that glutamatergic inputs to the
MPN enhance the MOR-mediated inhibition of lordosis (asocial behavior), while GABAergic inputs to the
VMH promote receptivity (social behavior), as measured by the lordosis response to stimulus males. 3)
Sexual receptivity involves a switch from glutamatergic to GABAergic neuron activation in the MeApd.
These experiments will determine if in females, as in males, the MeApd controls social behavior through
shift from glutamatergic (asocial) to GABAergic (social) outputs. First, we will determine the pattern of
glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron activation in the MeApd induced by estradiol, and estradiol +
progesterone is associated with the change from nonreceptive/asocial behavior to receptive/social behavior.
Finally, we will sequentially inhibit glutamatergic and GABAergic MeApd neurons in gonadally intact, cycling
vGLUT-Cre and vGAT-Cre mice using a Cre-dependent halorhodopsin-AAV. Together, these experiments
will provide a functional circuit analysis of how steroid signaling in the limbic-hypothalamic circuit leads a
prototypic social interaction, lordosis behavior."

Numerous studies show that connexin43 gap junctions play a critical, albeit complex, role in the achievement of peak
bone mass, maintenance of bone quality, and the response to the bone anabolic effects of intermittent parathyroid
hormone and mechanical load. The skeletal effects of connexin43 deletions differ based on age, loading, disuse, and
even anatomical location. This complexity has challenged the dogma regarding the function of connexin43 in bone in
certain contexts. While biophysical data have shown that second messengers of varying molecular mass can pass
through connexin43 channels, we have little insight into the which messengers are biologically relevant, their
biological consequences, and the range or directionality with which these signals propagate between osteocytes and
osteoblasts. These issues are fundamentally important to unravelling the seemingly paradoxical findings for
connexin43’s functions in bone and to understand bone homeostasis. Supported by new and published data and using
cAMP as a model second messenger, our goal is to test the idea that signals, which arise in a subset of responsive bone
cells, are then distributed by connexin43 across distances to the appropriate effector cells to coordinate tissue
remodeling. In the absence of connexin43, this asymmetrical response to the stimuli and inability to share it results in
unintended partitioning of signals in a subset of cells, disrupting the physiological function. These events, in turn,
result in hyper-signaling in the responding cells and the absence of signaling in neighboring populations. This
uncouples coordinated bone remodeling and leads to low bone quality. This model of signal partitioning could explain
these seemingly paradoxical findings for connexin43 deficiency in cortical bone basally and in response to load. We
will test the central hypothesis that intercellular communication of cAMP through connexin43 acts as a molecular
ruler, spatially defining bone remodeling. Thus, the ability of connexin43 to permit long-distance translation of
biological signals between cells defines the distance from a source that coordinated bone remodeling occurs. We will
examine this hypothesis in two aims. The first will examine how connexin43 communicated cAMP spatially regulates
osteoblast and osteocyte activity and cortical bone remodeling. The second will examine the molecular consequence
of connexin43-communicated cAMP on the magnitude and/or sensitivity of the cortical bone mechano-response. Our
exciting preliminary data show that cAMP primes the response of osteocytes to mechanical cues, at least in part, by
modulating the sensitivity of a TRPV4-dependent mechano-transduction pathway. In total, these studies will address
fundamentally important questions about the signals being transmitted by bone cells, the range and consequence with
which their communication impacts bone remodeling and will help to explain the paradoxical impacts of connexin43
on bone mechano-responsiveness and anabolic responses to intermittent PTH."
10932291,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a frequent and malignant renal cancer with a glycolytic phenotype due
to the loss of VHL tumor suppressor and activation of HIF transcription factors. Up to 50% of patients relapse
within five years after surgical resection. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to understand the molecular
mechanisms leading to ccRCC relapse and advancement. Pathogenic mechanisms underlying ccRCC
progression represent a key knowledge gap. Our recent discoveries demonstrate a copper accumulation in
advanced ccRCC. In this proposal, we interrogate impact for copper-dependent metabolic reprogramming in
driving ccRCC progression. Copper (Cu) is a metal cofactor of enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase
complex (CuCOX) essential for mitochondrial respiration, and a metalloallosteric regulator of cell proliferation
and survival. Using patients’ primary ccRCCs, we found accumulation of Cu and increased CuCOX strongly
correlated with advanced ccRCC and relapse. In cell line xenograft models, functional evidence shows that
dietary Cu drives growth of tumors and stimulates formation of CuCOX in cancer cells. We discovered that Cu
enhances electron transfer chain (ETC) activity with important functional consequences. High Cu induces (i)
assembly of the respiratory supercomplex (RSC) associated with regulatory subunit, COX7A2L, and (ii)
accumulation and remodeling of cardiolipins (CLs), phospholipids of the inner mitochondrial membrane
necessary for ETC activity. Surprisingly, despite glycolytic phenotype, Cu-reprogrammed cells recover
mitochondrial respiration, become hyperdependent on glucose and on the activity of CuCOX, and therefore are
highly sensitive to CuCOX inhibitors, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Importantly, we discovered that the
endocytic process of macropinocytosis is responsible for major proportion of Cu uptake by renal cancer cells.
Small molecules that function as donors of H2S are in preclinical trials, while inhibitors of MP are developed for
pharmacotherapies, prompting investigation of these pathways as targets for therapeutic interventions. We
propose that chronic accumulation of Cu in RCC cells promotes glucose oxidation via TCA cycle and ETC activity
causing glucose auxotrophy and stimulating bioenergy and biosynthesis required for tumor growth. To determine
the source of Cu, we will investigate macropinocytosis as little understood but major mechanism of Cu uptake
and its role in allocation of Cu to CuCOX (Aim 1). To understand Cu-dependent regulation of ETC activity, we
will investigate mechanisms of RSC formation, cardiolipin synthesis and the flux of glucose carbon (Aim 2).
Finally, because Cu-reprogramming creates new functional vulnerability to CuCOX inhibitors, we will investigate
effects of H2S in cell death and tumor formation (Aim 3). We will use several model systems, including RCC
cells, ex-vivo tumor fragments and patient derived tumor grafts. The study will identify basic mechanisms by
which high level of Cu in cancer cells regulate their metabolism supporting tumor growth. The research will lead
to the development of new biomarkers and therapies for cancer"

Between 25–44 million U.S. adults are estimated to have difficulties hearing in background noise despite having
normal audiometric thresholds. These difficulties can negatively impact health and quality of life. Currently, there
is no consensus on how to diagnose or treat these individuals. The long-term objective of this research program
is to translate knowledge of the auditory mechanisms underlying speech-in-noise (SIN) recognition to improve
the diagnosis and treatment of difficulties hearing in background noise. One potential mechanism is the medial
olivocochlear (MOC) reflex, an ear-brain network in which the brainstem reduces the response of the inner ear
to background noise. Previous studies in humans have yielded conflicting results regarding the association
between the MOC reflex and SIN recognition. These discrepant findings may be due, in part, to lack of inclusion
of individuals with SIN recognition difficulties. It is also possible that the reduction in masking produced by the
MOC reflex reduces listening effort in the presence of background noise, but this area has not been investigated
thoroughly. Finally, the contribution of the afferent (ascending) drive to the measured MOC reflex strength
remains unknown. The proposed studies will address these gaps in knowledge through three aims. Two groups
of age- and sex-matched adults with normal hearing will be recruited (n=104 per group). One group will have
self-reported SIN recognition difficulties and one group will have no self-reported SIN recognition difficulties, as
assessed using a validated questionnaire. Aim 1 will determine the ability of MOC reflex strength to predict self-
reported SIN recognition difficulties. The strength of the MOC reflex will be assessed using contralateral inhibition
of otoacoustic emissions, a non-invasive measure of efferent control of the inner ear. We hypothesize that MOC
reflex strength is a significant predictor of SIN recognition group classification. Aim 2 will determine the
association between MOC reflex strength and listening effort. The same participants from Aim 1 will perform a
word recognition in noise task at two signal-to-noise ratios. Listening effort will be quantified by verbal response
time and self-report. It is hypothesized that MOC reflex strength is a significant predictor of listening effort, and
the strength of the association between MOC reflex strength and listening effort depends on the signal-to-noise
ratio of the speech task. Aim 3 will determine the contribution of afferent drive to MOC reflex strength. The same
participants from Aim 1 will undergo auditory brainstem response testing and MOC reflex testing. Afferent drive
will be quantified as the amplitude of wave I of the auditory brainstem response. Associations between afferent
drive and MOC reflex strength will be assessed using correlational analyses. This aim is exploratory in nature.
The results of these studies will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of the functional role of the MOC
reflex. Additionally, the results will contribute to the development of better diagnostic tests and interventions for
difficulties with SIN recognition and listening effort."
10794258,"PROJECT SUMMARY - We began to quantify household- and community-level interactions in 2019 with our
project, “Comprehensive Profiling of Social Mixing Patterns in Resource Poor Countries” (“GlobalMix”, grant
R01 HD097175-01) to investigate human-to-human interactions relevant for respiratory infection transmission.
This proposal will build on existing GlobalMix study infrastructure to estimate LMIC-specific epidemiologic
parameters for COVID-19. In the proposed study, we will connect field epidemiology and mathematical
modeling approaches by estimating the rate of, and heterogeneity in, household-based transmission of SARS-
CoV-2 through longitudinal cohort approaches. We will use this information in conjunction with highly-granular
data on social interactions from GlobalMix to identify key epidemiological parameters for COVID-19, including
the community-level force of infection and attack rates within households. We will then use this information to
build LMIC-specific dynamic models, to evaluate the impact of key interventions to reduce transmission:
vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as face masks, shelter-in-place policies and school
closure. This work will be completed in three specific aims:
Aim 1: Quantify COVID-19 transmission across contact networks within the household environment. We will
conduct longitudinal respiratory disease surveillance in households participating in the GlobalMix study. We will
collect longitudinal samples of respiratory specimens from household members for identification of COVID-19
and other respiratory pathogens such as influenza. This information will be overlaid on contact network data
from GlobalMix.
Aim 2: Estimate key epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in LMIC
settings. We will collect blood specimens from GlobalMix study participants and test for antibody levels (IgG)
against SARS-CoV-2. We will calculate age-specific infection fatality rates (IFRs) and use antibody titers to
infer time of infection and calculate community-level incidence over time. We will generate age-structured
seroprevalence curves, which will provide a robust measure of exposure across the age range. Together with
the contact data from GlobalMix, we will infer age-specific transmission probabilities that will be used as inputs
into the network models in Aim 3. Samples will be stored for future testing, including antibody avidity and T/B
cell activation.
Aim 3. Estimate the impact of control measures on COVID-19 in LMIC. We will use the epidemiological
parameters estimated in Aim 1 and the setting- and age-specific force of infection estimates from Aim 2 to
parameterize dynamic network-based mathematical models of disease transmission. Models will incorporate
social mixing data from GlobalMix to project the impact of extended shelter-in-place policies, policies
concerning the use of face masks, and the introduction of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
10792257,"Title: Heterogeneous genetic architecture in lung cancer risk
Project Summary/Abstract
 Lung cancer is a multifactorial disease driven by environmental exposures, inherited germline genetic
variants, and an accumulation of somatic genetic events. Most lung cancer cases are attributed to cigarette
smoking. Approximately 10% of lung cancer cases have a family history of at least one first-degree relative.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified about 45 susceptibility loci directly influencing lung
cancer risk. The genetic architecture in individuals with a family history of lung cancer differs from those with
sporadic lung cancer, although there are common genetic loci influencing both cases. The magnitude of the
association between smoking and lung cancer risk varies by family history status. There is also a familial
component to smoking behaviors, which may confound the association of lung cancer risk with smoking in
hereditary cases.
 Each locus, however, exerts only a modest effect, and most of the heritability remains unexplained. New
approaches are therefore needed to address the problem of missing heritability. Since relatively weak signals of
a genetic risk factor are difficult to detect, an improvement would be to jointly model multiple genetic factors to
determine the impact of the risk. Using machine-learning, high-order interaction models among numerous
genetic features in subsets of cases defined according to the family history status, also considering smoking
behaviors can help illustrate how these genetic variants in each stratified subset jointly influence lung cancer
risk.
 The overarching aims of this proposal are to characterize the shared and distinct genetic contributions to
lung cancer development and provide better insight into homogeneous and heterogeneous genetic architectures
of lung cancer etiology across family history status in different populations. The specific aims of the proposed
research are to identify the hierarchical combination of multiple genetic variants for lung cancer susceptibility
using machine-learning and to explore in depth the impact of genetic factors in lung cancer GWAS of European-
and African-ancestry populations. This proposal capitalizes on existing well genotype-phenotype repositories of
sporadic and familial lung cancers using subset-based and machine-learning association methods in different
populations. This proposal addresses a comprehensive approach to improve our understanding of how
homogeneous and heterogeneous genetic architectures and biological mechanisms contribute to lung cancer
development and how specific genetic effects, additive, dominant, or recessive, explain lung cancer risk. Finally,
we can identify subgroups of individuals at high-risk based on the individual’s genetic characteristics, with
potential implications for the prevention, screening, and management of lung cancer."
10794209,"ABSTRACT
Intermittent fasting and caloric restriction are effective therapies against insulin resistance (IR) and non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Yet, intensive lifestyle modifications are rarely sustainable. We made the provocative
discovery that modulating systemic arginine status is sufficient to mimic the therapeutic effects of generalized
caloric restriction on hepatic steatosis. This is clinically significant, because targeting arginine is a tractable
pathway through which to treat metabolic disease. Accordingly, our long-term goal is to define the signaling
cascades underlying adaptive hepatic glucose fasting, so that we can identify new therapies that leverage these
pathways against IR, and NAFLD. Our unbiased transcriptomic screening in fasting mice identified a novel
glucose fasting-induced effector: the amino acid hydrolase, arginase 2 (ARG2). Our new data demonstrate that
forced hepatocyte-specific Arg2 expression reduces peripheral insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in
diabetic mice. Because hepatocyte arginine fate depends upon competition between ARG2 and the lysosomal
arginine sensing machinery that dictate autophagic flux, and the pro-inflammatory enzyme, inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), we hypothesize that fasting-induced hepatocyte ARG2 attenuates insulin resistance and
hepatic steatosis by depleting hepatocyte arginine. To test this, we will: 1) examine pleiotropic therapeutic
mechanisms of ARG2 action against insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation; 2) examine small-molecule
and advanced biological therapeutics that mimic the therapeutic actions of ARG2 activation and 3) define their
mechanistic underpinnings though single-cell sequencing. Completing these aims will: 1) establish arginine
status as a determinant of metabolic homeostasis; 2) identify how modulating arginase activity impacts
physiological outcomes; and 3) examine the efficacy and mechanisms of novel therapies against insulin
resistance and NAFLD."
10794210,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer
for which there are no approved targeted therapies. While standard chemotherapy reduces the risk of a
disease event, patients with residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a high risk of locoregional
recurrence despite surgical resection and aggressive postoperative radiotherapy. Therefore, better
understanding mechanisms of TNBC progression and identifying novel treatment approaches for
patients who have progressed on standard treatment are of great needs. PD-L1 is overexpressed in
TNBC, relative to normal breast tissue and other breast cancer subtypes. Aberrant PD-L1 expression on
tumors is an important means of evading elimination by its host immune system. The binding of programmed
death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) transmits signals that inhibit T-
cell activation. Therefore, abrogating the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with therapeutic antibodies has been explored
as a means to enhance antitumor immunity. Although the extracellular role of PD-L1 in the regulation of T-cell
responses has been well studied, potential intracellular functions of PD-L1 in cancer remain largely
unknown. Surprisingly, we have found that TNBC proliferation requires PD-L1 and a subset of PD-L1 localizes
in the nucleus and interacts with cohesin, a protein complex that is important for appropriate chromosome
alignment and segregation during the cell cycle. Our Preliminary Data suggest that PD-L1 directly regulates
cohesion function in TNBC. Knocking down PD-L1 dramatically causes incomplete chromosome segregation
and inhibits TNBC cell proliferation, while has no effect on normal cells. The central hypothesis being tested
in this proposal is that PD-L1 regulates cell cycle and chromosomal stability in triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC), and targeting the intracellular/nuclear function of PD-L1 or pathways (mitosis and
cohesin) regulated by PD-L1 is of therapeutic use. We propose to test this central hypothesis in the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1, Determine the role of PD-L1 in regulation of cell cycle, genomic stability, and
tumor cell proliferation by studying the exact mechanisms by which nuclear PD-L1 might regulate cohesion.
Aim 2, Study the regulation of PD-L1 during cell cycle and mitosis. Aim 3, Evaluate the inhibition of PD-L1
nuclear function on chromosome segregation, tumor growth and response to radiochemotherapy both in vitro
and in animal models. The overall impact from the successful completion of this work will be a more complete
understanding of the role of PD-L1 in cancer pathogenesis. In addition, our work will lead to the design of more
rational and effective combination therapies for TNBC patients by defining novel strategies that not only
enhance cancer therapy by inhibiting mitosis but also unleash the antitumor activity of the patient’s immune
system."
10794211,"Project Summary/Abstract
Many biological analytes of interest to both clinical oncologists and cancer researchers are unstable when the
unfixed biospecimens in which they reside are exposed to thawed conditions. For example, American Society
of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines state that the post-excision-
up-to-fixation exposure time span for tissues collected for clinical HER2 testing in breast cancer must be less
than 1 hour. For blood plasma/serum and many types of tissue specimens that are to be frozen, the proper
cold storage temperature is well below the common laboratory freezer temperature of -20 °C. For this and
many other reasons, every year improprieties and inconsistencies in pre-analytical sample handling and
storage generate unacceptably large numbers of costly false leads in biomedical research. Unsurprisingly,
experts in the field agree that this problem must be minimized immediately. Currently there are few tools and
not so much as one widely accepted approach by which to implement evidence-based tracking of biospecimen
exposure to thawed conditions. In practice, it is actually quite rare for biomedical researchers to employ any
evidence-based QA/QC tools at all—which suggests that easy-to-use, individual aliquot-level thawed-state
indicators could have a major impact on improving biospecimen quality tracking and therefore actual quality.
Here, we will develop color change-based indicators designed for 12 different biospecimen handling/storage
requirements that ultimately will be implemented by placement into custom-designed dual-chambered, flex-
activated (like a glow-stick) see-through devices that can be housed on (notched into) the outside of a specially
designed sample storage vial. Once the bright pink color of permanganate (Mn(VII)) in the indicator turns clear
due to its reduction to Mn(II) (as easily seen from the outside of the storage vial), this indicates that the
specimen inside the vial has been exposed to a time-temperature span that is outside of the allowed
storage/handling parameters. Importantly, subsets of these indicators will not freeze until -33.5 °C or -76 °C,
facilitating the unprecedented ability to track exposures to very cold, but nevertheless improper storage
temperatures—all in a manner that will be difficult to ignore by anyone handling the samples.
Development of these indicators will be accomplished via two specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Establish kinetic control of the permanganate/oxalate reaction system by designing reaction
starting conditions so that 12 uniquely useful time/temperature indicating solutions are developed.
Specific Aim 2: Verify that reaction kinetics and temperature sensitivities for the 12 indicators behave as
expected—that is, A) accurately, precisely (reproducibly), and with substantially increasing run times at 25 °C,
4 °C, 0 °C, and -20 °C—and B) remain accurate and precise when different stock solutions, reagent lots,
analysts, or varying periods of freezing are involved."
10794281,"ABSTRACT: Acute infection with malaria is often accompanied by the symptoms of a systemic cytokine storm.
These symptoms result from a systemic inflammatory response via the activation of phagocytes. The overall
goal of our ongoing project is to define the mechanisms of innate immune activation and regulation that account
for the clinical symptoms and complications of malaria. This grant is a renewal of R01 AI079293. This RO1 has
been highly productive having resulted in 40 publications including 16 peer-reviewed manuscripts of original
work in the latest funding period (9 of these directly related to the grant, an additional 5 papers were supported
by grant-related infrastructure in Brazil). Over the last decade, we have defined what we believe to be the
principal “malaria toxins” and their cognate receptors: parasite AT-rich DNA, immune complexes, hemozoin, free
heme, and GPI anchors. We found that these ligands drive Toll-like receptors (TLRs 2, 3, 4, 9), NOD-like
receptors (NLRP3, NLRP12), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and the cGAS-STING pathway. Our work led to
recognition that a cytosolic DNA binding protein Cnbp, regulates IL12b and IFNg and, under certain conditions,
type I interferons. We have described the phenomena of innate immune memory in malaria, which is one part
of an epigenetic process that may both protect the human host or, under certain conditions, might result in severe
malaria (especially if accompanied by bacterial infection). More recently, we have identified several lncRNAs in
malaria-stimulated phagocytes, many of which might regulate clinical disease. Thus, we have accomplished
most of what we set out to do 5 years ago. In this renewal, we plan to focus on identifying the most basic
methods by which the innate immune system is regulated in malaria by combining cell culture studies, in vitro
mouse work with the analysis of patient samples. There are three Aims. The major hypothesis of the grant is
that the innate immune response is highly regulated via epigenetic modifications of chromatin as well as at the
transcriptional level. This regulation involves the interaction of lymphoid cells with phagocytes, resulting in innate
immune training and a variety of epigenetic changes. The epigenetic changes involve the modification of
chromatin, alterations of chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). In addition, inflammatory signals during malaria result
in the generation of long non-coding RNAs including LUCAT-1 and LIMIT, whose roles we will explore in detail
in vitro, in a LUCAT-1 KO mouse and in human clinical samples (Aim 2). Finally, we will define the role of a
transcriptional regulator known as Cnbp, a nucleic acid binding protein that we initially thought to be a DNA
sensor. Cnbp has proven to be involved in regulating IL12beta transcription and expression via its interaction
with c-Rel and the IL12 promoter (Aim 3). In all of the Aims described briefly above, we will analyze leukocytes
from febrile patients with malaria (both P. vivax and P falciparum) from our site in Porto Velho, Brazil. This grant
is an ambitious project built upon the successful completion of two previously ambitious grants. Over the next
funding cycle, we hope to contribute significantly more to our knowledge of innate immunity in malaria."
10794282,"Project Summary
Gain-of-function Notch mutations are among the most frequent mutations in small B cell lymphomas, including
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Harboring Notch mutation is also a
predictor of poor outcomes in small B cell lymphomas, which despite recent advances remain incurable with
chemotherapy. Together, these observations provide a compelling rationale for focusing on Notch inhibitors as
potential therapeutic options in small B cell lymphomas. Unfortunately, progress in treating patients with Notch
inhibitors has been stymied partly due to a limited understanding of underlying mechanisms of sensitivity and
resistance to Notch inhibitors. Here, we represent a concerted effort to overcome these limitations and fill major
gaps in current knowledge by testing our central hypothesis that Notch-driven activation and positioning of
enhancers synergize Notch and several crucial signaling pathways to co-activate pro-growth and survival genes
in small B cell lymphomas. This premise is based on our preliminary data showing an important consequence of
Notch inhibition is decommissioning and repositioning of putative enhancer elements associated with key genes
in primary small B cell lymphoma samples, including several components of B cell receptor (BCR) and cytokine
signaling pathways. We will test this hypothesis by using cutting-edge functional genomics, chromatin
conformation capture, genome engineering, and single-cell resolution genomics and optical assays. We will
systematically determine: i) the Notch-dependent enhancer activation and nuclear positioning, and their genomic
requirements that together mediate crosstalk between Notch, BCR and cytokine signaling pathways; ii) the
rewiring of Notch-driven epigenetic program that enables drug-resistant cells to bypass effects of Notch inhibitors
and maintain the expression of critical Notch targets. Together, these complementary studies will greatly expand
understanding of epigenetic mechanisms underpinning sensitivity and resistance to Notch inhibitors and provide
a clearer rationale for targeting Notch in small B cell lymphoma."
10794081,"Millions of Americans suffer from deficits in reward processing and working memory, in the context of
psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder. Socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals experience disproportionate levels of early life stress
(ELS) and exposure to environmental pollution, which increase the risk of developing these disorders. We
hypothesize that exposure to these environmental insults disrupt the specific brain circuits needed for reward
processing and working memory. Critically, only invasive animal studies can directly causally test the causal
relationship between environmental exposure, brain circuit pathology, and deficits in reward processing and
working memory. Such studies rely on the evolutionarily conserved circuitry that underlies domain-general
cognitive processes. For example, the ability to learn about predictable rewards relies on ventral tegmental
area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neuron computations of reward prediction error (RPE), while working memory to
depends on neural activity in the hippocampus (HC). Our preliminary experimental studies in mice reveal that
early exposure to pollution and stress alter DA circuitry and the behavioral response to unexpected outcomes.
We also find that ELS disrupts the ability to maintain sequences while navigating by altering HC circuitry.
These data raise the possibility that exposure to ELS and pollution cause reward processing and working
memory deficits by disrupting VTA DA and HC circuits. Crucially, the HC and DA system (particularly
projections from the ventral tegmental area [VTA]) work in tandem for both reward processing and working
memory. We therefore propose to systematically test how ELS and diesel fuel interact to disrupt HC and VTA
structure and function to cause enduring deficits in RPE and WM. Aim 1 will test how ELS and diesel fuel
exposure (alone and in tandem) impact VTA circuitry and reward learning and WM. Aim 2 will test how these
environmental insults impact HC circuitry and reward learning and WM. Finally Aim 3 will test how ELS and
diesel fuel pollution impacts VTA-HC interactions during reward learning and WM. To do so, we will use state-
of-the-art circuit dissection, optogenetics manipulation, and in vivo neural recording approaches. Experiments
from this proposal will yield a comprehensive understanding of how neurotoxic pollutants and ELS impact the
evolutionarily conserved circuits and cognitive functions that underlie the reward processing and concentration
deficits that cut across multiple psychiatric disorders. This knowledge will prove critical for informing policy to
mitigate environmental injury as well as for designing circuit-based interventions for symptoms caused by early
life pollution and stress exposure."

As the prevalence of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease continues to increase, understanding the mechanistic
causes of this disease is becoming increasingly critical. Recent clinical studies have linked increased stiffness
of the large arteries to both impaired memory and Alzheimer’s disease. It is hypothesized that these relations
are a result of large artery stiffness-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction. Increased large artery stiffness leads
to greater pulsatility of pressure and blood flow in the cerebral vasculature, which is known to cause vascular
damage. Dysfunction of the cerebral arteries and microvasculature is associated with cognitive impairment and
greater Alzheimer’s disease-related neuropathology. Furthermore, amyloid-β (Aβ) induces cerebrovascular
damage, and cerebrovascular impairment increases Aβ accumulation, thus creating a vicious cycle of
cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology. The goal of the proposed studies is to provide the first proof-
of-concept evidence that age-related increases in large artery stiffness, synergistically with greater Aβ
production, lead to cognitive impairment, neuropathology, and cerebrovascular dysfunction. To accomplish this
goal, we will employ transgenic mouse models of greater large artery stiffness and greater Aβ production, as
well as use a pharmacological intervention to prevent age-related increases in large artery stiffness. In Aim 1,
we will assess the effects of large artery stiffness, in combination with Aβ, on cognitive dysfunction and
Alzheimer’s disease-related neuropathology. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of large artery stiffness, in
combination with Aβ, on cerebral blood flow and cerebral vascular reactivity and structural integrity. In Aim 3,
we will identify candidate mechanisms by which large artery stiffness and greater cerebral artery pulsatility lead
to cerebrovascular dysfunction. To do so, we will examine the role and source(s) of vascular oxidative stress,
as well as perform transcriptome analysis of cerebral arteries and microvascular endothelial cells. The
knowledge to be gained by completing the proposed aims will inform future studies to identify novel therapeutic
targets for the prevention or attenuation of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease."

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and secondary pulmonary embolism (together, VTE) affect 900,000
Americans, and result in >60,000 deaths each year. A growing body of evidence supports the concept of
crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation which amplifies the thrombo-inflammatory response in VTE.
Activated, injured, and dying cells release nucleotides that form purinergic halo of “danger” signals that disrupt
vascular homeostasis. Located on the surface of leukocytes and the endothelium, the vascular
ectonucleotidase, CD39 rapidly phosphohydrolyzes ATP, and ADP to extinguish these “danger” signals and
promote homeostasis. We have found that CD39 is a potent suppressor of the thrombo-inflammatory response
in DVT. Our new preliminary data show that CD39 inhibits circulating leukocyte-platelet interactions, and
restricts activation of programmed innate immune responses, including inflammasome assembly and
neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, key drivers of the growing thrombus. The hypothesis driving this
work is that CD39 provides a critical vascular checkpoint at the intersection of innate immunity and thrombosis
to arrest the relentless venous thrombo-inflammatory cycle. Using unique cell lineage (myeloid, neutrophil,
endothelial)-specific CD39 gene-deleted mice we have generated, and complementary models of DVT, we will:
1) Elucidate the role for CD39 on cellular recruitment during venous thrombogenesis and maturation. These
experiments will define the effect of lineage-specific CD39 on blood cell recruitment, and the spatial dynamics
of their interactions during venous thrombogenesis; 2) Determine the mechanism(s) by which myeloid CD39
protects against venous thrombo-inflammation. These experiments will determine the contributions of
macrophage and neutrophil CD39 to venous thrombosis. Complementary in vitro and in vivo studies with
genetically-modified mice will elucidate the molecular signaling processes by which CD39 inhibits
inflammasome activation during thrombogenesis; 3) Determine the effect of CD39-deficiency on microvesicle
phenotype, function, and kinetics, during venous thrombosis. These studies will reveal the functional
consequences of altering global- and lineage-specific CD39 on microvesicle-mediated thrombo-inflammatory
signaling. These studies should yield new insights into how an ectonucleotidase that functions as a checkpoint
at the intersection of thrombosis and inflammation may be exploited to improve treatments in venous
thrombosis."
10795045,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cannabis use continues to be high among adolescents and is increasing in young adults. This is a significant
public health issue as heavy cannabis use during this period is linked to an increased risk for developing
affective, addictive, or psychotic disorders later in life. Adolescence and early adulthood are also when the
prefrontal cortex (PFC), which plays a key role in executive function and working memory, is maturing.
Interestingly, psychiatric disorders seen following early cannabis use often involve the PFC and deficits in
executive function are common in these disorders. This suggests that adolescent cannabis use disrupts PFC
maturation, impairing working memory/executive function and increasing risk for later psychiatric disorders.
This hypothesis is supported by functional imaging studies of individuals who heavily used cannabis during
adolescence that have identified defects in functional connectivity between PFC and several brain regions.
Thus, cannabis use may cause miswiring of PFC circuits, increasing the risk for psychiatric disorders.
To better understand the consequences and mechanisms of cannabis use during adolescence and early
adulthood, we model this process in rodents by adolescent administration of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
the primary intoxicating component of cannabis. These studies robustly demonstrate enduring deficits in PFC-
mediated behaviors following adolescent THC that are lacking if similar doses of THC are given to adults,
emphasizing a specific window of vulnerability. Our preliminary data investigating potential mechanisms have
identified three, likely-interrelated processes. The first is that adolescent THC treatment decreases projections
from the mediodorsal thalamus to the medial PFC (mPFC). The second is that adolescent THC treatment
causes neuroinflammation, including increased IL-6 and activated microglia. The third is that co-treatment with
cannabidiol prevents the behavioral and neuroinflammatory effects of adolescent THC. In the proposed
studies we will investigate the mechanisms underlying these findings and evaluate mechanism-based potential
therapies to reverse the behavioral and cognitive abnormalities caused by adolescent THC.
We propose to develop a mechanistic understanding of the consequences of adolescent cannabis use by
combining molecular, anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches to complete three aims:
Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that CB1 receptors are required for the detrimental effects of adolescent
THC on working memory and evaluate potential therapies to reverse these deficits.
Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that adolescent THC exposure reduces MD thalamus/mPFC connectivity to
impair working memory.
Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that adolescent THC activates microglia to excessively prune mPFC inputs
from the MD thalamus to impair working memory."

There is a growing sector of modern tobacco-free oral nicotine pouches (NPs) that are federally regulated as
non-medicinal nicotine/tobacco products. While NPs employ marketing approaches that may attract current
tobacco users, such as marketing themes connoting minimal harm, information on the long-term health effects
of NPs is lacking. NPs may appeal to young adults because they are available in similar product characteristics
(e.g., nicotine concentration, protonated nicotine) that many young people prefer to use in e-cigarettes. In
addition, NPs may be of particular interest to young adult e-cigarette users because these products can be used
discreetly where vaping is not allowed, which may translate into an increased likelihood of becoming dual users
of e-cigarettes and NPs. Indeed, approximately 15% young adults who used EC in the past 30 days were past
30-day NP users. Manufacturers of modern NPs use acid additives to lower pH, which changes nicotine from a
free-base to a protonated nicotine, resulting in improved appeal and sensory experience and higher abuse
liability. Thus, nicotine concentration and pH in modern NPs should be focal targets for regulatory policies.
Evidence is also lacking on mechanisms mediating differences in product appeal and abuse liability of NPs
across products varying in nicotine concentration and pH level. The scientific objective of this research plan is to
assess the effect of variation in nicotine concentration in NPs and its interaction effect with pH level on three
proximal outcomes of relevance to FDA regulation: (1) sensory attributes, (2) product appeal, and (3) abuse
liability among young adult dual users of NPs and e-cigarettes. This innovative project proposes to conduct
double-blind within-subject randomized clinical trials in which participants (N≈156 [Aim 1 N = 72; Aim 2 N = 84])
will administer NPs varied by nicotine concentration (e.g., 4 vs 2 mg) and pH (e.g., ≥9 vs ≤8, ≥1 point difference)
across two flavors (e.g., mint, fruit) to achieve the project aims: to evaluate the effects of nicotine concentration,
pH, and flavor on subjective product appeal and sensory attributes of NPs (Aim 1); to assess the effects of
nicotine concentration and its interplay with pH on abuse liability of NPs (Aim 2); to estimate the extent to which
sensory attribute mediates the pH-moderated effect of nicotine concentration on product appeal and abuse
liability (Aim 3). The findings of this proposed research will provide the FDA with new evidence necessary to
inform regulatory restrictions on product characteristics and constituents of NPs, which may put young adults at
risk of using a novel class of oral nicotine products. A career development plan that complements the research
plan builds on the applicant’s background in behavioral epidemiology and quantitative analytic skills, which
outlines new training in three areas: (1) clinical trial experiments testing the effects of exposure to tobacco
products on behavioral responses (e.g., abuse liability), (2) product characteristics and constituents of emerging
oral nicotine products, and (3) within-subject data and causal mediation analyses. The combined research and

Converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that deviations from typical brain structure development
take place prior to psychosis onset, while ‘big data’ neuroimaging studies of adults with psychosis find subtle,
widespread gray matter disruptions in the brain. In this proposal, we will synergize knowledge about normative
structural neurodevelopment and findings of structural brain aberrations in adults with psychosis to develop
cost-effective brain-based markers of psychosis risk in youth. To improve identification of those at greatest risk,
we leverage results from large-scale structural neuroimaging studies of psychosis to create a ‘Psychosis
Neuroimaging Score’, a cumulative summary score that reflects one’s psychosis liability. We first aim to
transport the Psychosis Neuroimaging Score to youth by incorporating crucial aspects of structural brain
development. In Aim 1, we will characterize the normative developmental trajectory of the Psychosis
Neuroimaging Score by harmonizing many archival datasets of normative development (N>5,000, 2-30 years
old). We will then evaluate how greater age-associated deviation from the aggregate Psychosis Neuroimaging
Score differentiates youth with psychosis spectrum symptoms from typically developing youth in the
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (N=1209, 10-22 years old). In Aim 2, we plan to examine how
greater age-associated deviation from the aggregate Psychosis Neuroimaging Score predicts distinct
developmental trajectories associated with psychotic-like experiences in youth from the Adolescent Brain and
Cognitive Development Study (N=11,875). We will also assess the extent to which known psychosis risk
factors (e.g., family history of psychosis, obstetric complications, trauma) contribute to characterization of these
trajectories. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose to use measurement-in-error modeling to establish a functional
relationship between Psychosis Neuroimaging scores generated from 3T MRI scans and those generated
using low-field MRI scans in a community sample of youth. Results from this study will allow us to create more
affordable, clinically accessible biological indicators of severe psychopathology, ultimately improving
identification of young people at greatest risk and allowing earlier, more effective interventions."
10802334,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cellular ATP demand and mitochondrial ATP synthesis are tightly linked. ATP synthesis, in turn, depends on
(1) NADH generation in the TCA cycle and (2) recycling of the adenine nucleotide pool. When ATP is
depleted and AMP rises, the cell increases energy generation and curtails energy expenditure until
homeostasis is restored. In the context of mitochondrial pathology, the system becomes unhinged…
Reticular Dysgenesis (RD) is a rare hematologic disease, caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the
mitochondrial enzyme Adenylate Kinase 2 (AK2). AK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of AMP to ADP in the
inter-membrane space to generate substrate for ATP synthesis1. RD patients suffer from severe congenital
neutropenia, lymphopenia, and die early in life unless cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation5.
We have developed a novel biallelic CRISPR-knockout model of AK2 in primary human hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells to precisely mimic the failure of human myelopoiesis in culture and after transplantation
into mice. Using broad metabolomic profiling, our preliminary studies revealed that AK2-deficient myeloid
progenitors exhibit a high NADH/NAD+ ratio and NAD+ depletion, consistent with reductive stress. In
addition, AK2-deficient myeloid progenitors displayed a decrease in mitochondrial metabolites, including TCA
cycle intermediaries and aspartate, while lipid carnitines were increased, and lipid droplets were found in the
cytoplasm. We also detected highly elevated levels of the purine intermediate inosine monophosphate
(IMP) and a decrease in rRNA and ribosome subunits. Interestingly, our studies suggest the high IMP stems
from deamination of AMP, rather than a block in purine de novo synthesis. Taken together, these observations
raise the possibility that AK2 deficiency causes mitochondrial reductive stress, curtailing TCA cycle activity and
diverting carbon and electron pools into lipid synthesis while counteracting the accumulation of AMP.
These findings led us to hypothesize that AK2 deficiency causes two interconnected but distinct pathologies:
I. Reductive stress redirecting energy metabolism into lipid storage rather than OXPHOS;
II. Accumulation of AMP and IMP, leading to defects in nucleotide metabolism. Our proposed studies will
test if failure of myelopoiesis is primarily a result of reductive stress and impaired energy utilization, versus
impaired purine metabolism, or both. We will determine if myelopoiesis can be rescued by correcting the
NADH/NAD+ ratio or nucleotide pools. Lastly, we will validate our findings in an in vivo model of RD and
investigate if different compensatory mechanisms in different blood lineages result in the RD phenotype.
We use RD as a model to dissect escape mechanisms at the juncture of energy metabolism, redox stress,
and nucleotide homeostasis. These insights will advance therapies for mitigating reductive stress and using
cell type-specific manipulation of purine metabolism as a strategy for immunosuppression and cancer therapy."

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is going to be at the center of climate change adverse health
impacts. Already record heatwaves, high frequency of desert dust storms, drought and low precipitation, and
high air pollution are being documented. However, studies about their health impacts on the populations are
scarce and not linked to climate change policies and there is limited multi-country efforts in the MENA Region to
address the different health effects of climate change. In our project, we aim to establish the “GeoHealth Hub for
Climate Change and Health in MENA” through two components: the U2R which represents the part related to
capacity building of stakeholders from the MENA Regions and the U01 which is the component developing the
research profile. From MENA, the Jordan University for Science and Technology, The University of Balamand,
and Mohamed VI University of Health Sciences will be partnering with the University of California San Diego,
University of California Berkeley, and Harvard University from the U.S. In addition, the U.S. CDC, and the WHO
Center for Environmental Health Action will be an integral part of the hub. The impacts of climate change on
health, water, air pollution and identified gaps and areas of development in environmental and public health will
be the initial focus of the hub. The ultimate goal is to produce and support climate change policies that protect
and promote environmental and public health and become the state-of-the-art entity to provide models and tools
for quantifying the health and economic impacts of climate change risks in relation to water scarcity, heat waves,
air pollution, and desert dust. The research project in Jordan will study the impact of two climate change-induced
public health threats: (1) water scarcity and nitrate pollution and (2) heatwaves. The spatial and temporal
downscaled climate change will be constructed to identify areas of potential vulnerability to climate change. The
spatial and temporal analysis of nitrate pollution across Jordan will be assessed. Moreover, the impact of nitrate
levels on birth weight of newborns will be documented. Furthermore, the impact of heatwaves on mortality under
the baseline climate scenario as well as under the climate ensemble model predictions will be investigated. In
Lebanon, the health impact of air pollution on respiratory, cardiovascular, and skin allergic diseases among
women and children will be studied. In Morocco, the association of desert dust air pollution with climate will be
determined using large-scale atmospheric patterns and climate indices. Seasonal weather patterns favorable to
particulate pollution partially originating from the Saharan desert will be identified. These studies build on prior
research conducted by the team members and will be followed up by policies recommendations on wastewater
reuse, heatwaves alerts, and air pollution from combustion and desert dust. Ministries of Health and Environment
from participating countries will be key partners in this project and will be involved in capacity building and training
of their relevant staff in air pollution, water quality and advanced environmental epidemiology."

Employment rank within workplaces has long been known to be correlated with a wide a range of health
outcomes, including morbidity and life expectancy. Our proposed project will extend the research on
workplace social status as a determinant of health by examining the associations between a wide range
of social status measures and health outcomes separately by race, ethnicity, and gender. We will
examine whether inequality in earnings within workplaces exacerbates the impacts of employment rank
on minority health disparities, and whether demographic homophily between workers and firm
managers is a social determinant of health. To do this we will use a novel database that links health
insurance enrollment records and medical claims to administrative earnings data for more than 1.8
million workers and 50,000 firms in Utah. Using a broad set of firms will allow us to separate the
impacts of financial resources from within-firm social status measures.
We will consider two distinct research designs to evaluate whether workplace social status has a causal
effect of health. The first will leverage quasi-experimental shocks to workplace social status caused by
firm mergers, splits, and by industry-specific international trade shocks that alter worker promotion
rates. The second will examine the health impacts of changes in social status when workers move jobs.
To account for the endogeneity of changes in social status we will construct instrumental variables
based on network statistics from the labor market. We will connect each worker to their coworkers, and
instrument for changes in social status measures with the changes of each worker’s former coworkers
who also changed jobs. We will use this design to understand the importance of job referral networks
on the segregation of labor market opportunities, which can create structural barriers to minority
workers escaping psychosocial and physical workplace hazards. Finally, we will link workers to their
adult children in the workforce to quantify the intergenerational persistence of health disparities that
operates through the workplace social status channel, and how this channel contributes to structural
racial and ethnic health disparities."

National statistics clearly indicate a disparity in the number of underrepresented minorities
obtaining higher degrees in biomedical or biobehavioral disciplines. Given that the University of
California, Merced (UC Merced) is an established Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) with the
highest percentage of Hispanic undergraduates enrolled of any of the 10 UC campuses, UC Merced
is ideally situated to realize the greatest benefit from an NIH U*RISE T34 training grant. Our
proposed U*RISE program will support undergraduate scholars of primarily Hispanic-descent
given our demographics, but we expect to use this opportunity to attract more students from other
backgrounds to enhance the diversity of our campus and ultimately of our training pool. Thus,
our proposal has potential for the highest impact to help transform the diversity of our
undergraduate student body and ultimately the diversity of the graduate ranks as well. Data from
our campus indicate a justified need to enhance and enrich the quantitative skills of our
undergraduate scholars via focused research training in computational and/or systems biology.
Faculty expertise and a history of extramural funding to support UC Merced’s many
computational biology and Applied Math components makes a U*RISE program focusing on
quantitative skills highly pertinent and sustainable at UC Merced. Thus, U*RISE at UC Merced
will emphasize providing an enriching research experience for undergraduate scholars by
providing unique opportunities in computational biology and/or systems biology including
bioinformatics, multiple “-omics” approaches, and big data analytics. The innovation in our
program lies in the cohort approach in which cohorts of trainees will work collaboratively on
projects and in our novel learning modules. The strong institutional commitment from the
Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, the Office of Undergraduate Education, and the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC) will help ensure the successful training
and placement of all our scholars. Levering other institutional resources such as UC Merced’s
Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI) will also help succor the program’s successes. In
summary, given UC Merced’s HSI status, demographics, and demonstrated need for enhanced
training of its undergraduate scholars with a focus on quantitative skills makes it an ideal training
institution to establish a U*RISE program with the potential for very high impact."

Tennessee State University (TSU) is a Historically Black College/University (HBCU) founded in 1912. A very
high percentage of TSU undergraduate students are from groups historically under-represented (UR) in
biomedical research. More than 95% of TSU undergraduates are UR with 79% African American, 2.1%
Hispanic, and 0.19% Native/Am. Indian. The proposed TSU Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for
Student Enhancement (U-RISE) program has the overarching goal of increasing the number of UR
undergraduate students who pursue the necessary education/training (Ph.D. degrees in biomedicine) to
engage in biomedical research careers. The TSU U-RISE program will provide the psychosocial resources,
course work, and research experiences needed for students to progress from undergraduate school to
graduate school (Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D. programs). The proposed program will support 3 Junior and 3
Senior undergraduate students majoring in Biology, Chemistry, or Psychology. A number of strategies
and activities are proposed to achieve the following specific goals of the program: 1. Increase the retention
and 4-year graduation rates of students who participate in the TSU U-RISE program above those of
TSU as a whole and of the departments participating in the TSU U-RISE program. The retention and
graduation rates of the proposed U-RISE program trainees would be expected to be greater than 90%. 2.
Prepare UR students who are pursuing a BS degree in Biology, Chemistry, or Psychology to apply to
graduate programs in the biomedical sciences (specifically Ph.D. programs). The program will support 3
Junior and 3 Senior level students each year and aims to have a minimum of 2 of the 3 graduating students
(67%) applying to PhD programs within 2 years of graduating. 3. Provide the course work, research
experiences, and psychosocial resources (workshops, communities of practice, and learning
communities) needed for students to gain acceptance to those Ph.D. programs to which they apply.
Have 75% of those students who apply to Ph.D. programs (in a given 2-year period) gain acceptance within 2
years of graduating. 4. Develop critical thinking skills of TSU U-RISE trainees to prepare them for the
level of analytical rigor needed for graduate program admission and completion. The GRE is to some
extent a measure of these skills. The objective is to have average verbal and quantitative scores of 154 (64th
percentile verbal, 53rd percentile quantitative) for those students who take the exam. Another measure of
critical thinking skills will be the ability to critically discuss research papers, which will be assessed each
semester in the current biomedical topics course. 5. Develop the presentation skills of TSU U-RISE
program participants. Each of the first year U-RISE participants will present their research at a minimum of 2
scientific meetings per year (national, regional, or local). In the second year, students will present at 1 national
discipline specific meeting and a minimum of 1 regional or local meeting."
10802380,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurological disease associated with movement abnormality. It has been 25
years since the first genetic cause of PD was identified, and yet there is still no effective treatment for the disease. One of
the hinders we think is the lack of models that assess early PD pathogenesis and therapy responses in its real
neurophysiological environment. This provides a significant bottleneck in our ability to make progress in this disease.
Two lines of recent evidence motivate us to study PD pathogenesis in a real neurophysiological environment: (1) Human
neuroimaging data and animal models both showed that synaptic disruption proceeds neuronal death, making the case
that PD is a synaptopathy. (2) Many novel, regulatory, non-coding RNAs show linkage to PD pathogenesis. For instance,
we found over 20,000 enhancer RNAs (or eRNAs) candidates in dopamine neurons of human post-mortem brains (Dong et
al. Nature Neuroscience, 2018). They significantly co-localized with PD risk variants. The other class of novel RNAs is
circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are predominantly enriched in the brain, highly specific to the synapse, and ultra-stable
(e.g., 10x longer half-life than linear RNAs). We identified >11,000 circRNAs actively expressed in the dopamine neurons,
many of which are significantly associated with PD pathology (Dong et al. in submission). More importantly, circRNAs can
form a regulatory network with lncRNAs and miRNAs, and can be wrapped into extracellular vesicles (EV), penetrating
blood-brain barriers. Based on these, we hypothesize that regulatory RNAs incl. circRNAs, eRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs
can be detected in EV and might play a role in the synaptic dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.
To test this hypothesis, we need a model to recapitulate the dynamic physiological microenvironment of PD pathogenesis.
In this study, we will combine our expertise in brain organoids, PD biology, exosome analysis, single-cell omics,
bioinformatics, and biomedical engineering to develop a new 3D brain organoids microphysiological analysis platform
(MAP) to recapitulate the dopamine neurons' interconnectivity and study molecular neurodegeneration
systematically. We will (1) first develop PD organoids and profile the transcriptome (incl. circRNAs, miRNAs, mRNAs,
lncRNAs, etc.) of secreted EV and single-cell transcriptome of brain organoids, to identify PD-associated RNAs, then (2)
map the pathophysiological dynamics of PD organoids in a novel, high-throughput, mini-brain-on-chip platform, and last
will (3) integrate the EV-organoid temporal multi-dimensional data to infer the PD-associated RNAs and their regulatory
dynamics during the PD pathogenesis.
Recent breakthroughs in RNA therapeutics have led to multiple first-in-human trials and clinical approval (e.g., Moderna,
Alnylam, and Ionis pharmaceuticals). circRNAs have many advantages over linear RNAs, making them potentially better
suited for translation into therapeutics and diagnostics. EVs secreted from PD organoids provide a good proxy of fluid
biopsy for studying PD brain's neuropathology. Thus, this interdisciplinary (neurology, biomedical engineering,
computational genomics) study will set an important, highly innovative foundation for understanding PD neuropathology
and exosome treatment."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction
and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling.
The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 54 children) and the associated costs are
enormous. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have advanced methods for the analysis of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using both task-based and resting-state data, for classiﬁcation,
facilitating identiﬁcation of ASD biomarkers, and using these biomarkers for personalized outcome prediction
for Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an evidence-based form of behavioral therapy for ASD. We have made
great strides with our most recent work focusing on deep learning techniques for extracting biomarkers and
predicting outcome using novel strategies focusing on temporal characteristics with Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks as well as spatial characteristics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Improved use and
characterization of the dynamic changes in connectivity appear crucial for advancing performance based both on
our work and the literature. Thus, in our proposed work, we intend to develop a richer, integrated model that can
more fully exploit the complete spatiotemporal characteristics of the data and its inherent dynamics. In addition, a
key issue in deep learning strategies is access to large datasets which remains a challenge, especially given that
ASD is a spectrum with a range of characteristics, severity and comorbidities and that fMRI is a powerful tool that
encompasses many task-based and resting state acquisition paradigms. Comorbidities are a particular challenge
and opportunity in that they have the potential to increase our understanding of the heterogeneous manifestations
of ASD. We propose to further develop and expand the power and impact of our methodology by broadening our
subject base to include ASD comorbidities (e.g. anxiety, ADHD, depression) and multiple treatment strategies. We
will advance our technology by creating a more integrated spatiotemporal analysis combining our LSTM and GNN
approaches. We will use domain adaptation methods to properly exploit multiple fMRI paradigms in conjunction
with secure federated learning strategies to facilitate multi-institutional data usage with privacy. These innovative
approaches will allow us to improve the practicability of predicting quantitative treatment outcomes in ASD and
measuring associated neuroimaging biomarkers."

assessed and, with the guidance of mentoring teams, a learning plan will address potential
weaknesses in their PhD admissions applications. Furthermore, a strong research experience
and development of professional skills, including lab skills, critical thinking, manuscript and grant
writing, presentation skills and self-assessment skills will be emphasized. Scholars will enter the
program in June with the summer and fall focused on academic support and activities, including,
course work, tutoring and writing and interview workshops that will augment their application for
training programs. The second part of the year will focus on research skills. Throughout the
program professional development and career options will be emphasized. Outcomes include all
BU-PREP scholars submitting competitive applications to graduate schools with at least 75%, if
not higher, of them to be accepted into graduate programs."

 Advances in organic synthetic methodology can profoundly impact the development of new and useful
medicines. For example, cross-coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in medicinal chemistry,
provided entry to previously inaccessible chemical space, and enhanced drug discovery efforts. Recently,
methods for the selective functionalization of C–H bonds have gained attention from the pharmaceutical industry
due to their potential utility in the diversification of drug-like scaffolds. Toward this end, metal-catalyzed C–H
functionalization reactions that take advantage of polar functional groups to direct site-selective C–H activation
have been extensively explored. In comparison, methods that avoid the use of pre-installed directing groups, or
“undirected” C–H functionalization reactions, are underdeveloped. Specifically, the selective and undirected
metal-catalyzed activation of strong primary C(sp3)–H bonds in the presence of weaker C–H bonds represents
an ongoing challenge in the field. Notably, such technologies would provide chemists with useful synthetic tools
to install functionality at remote sites on bioactive molecules. Though methods for the undirected selective
catalytic functionalization of methyl groups to forge C–C, C–B, and C–Cl bonds have recently emerged, a general
catalytic oxidation (C–O bond formation) of unactivated primary C(sp3)–H bonds is unknown.
 Metal-stabilized carbenes, nitrenes, and oxenes are useful reactive intermediates that can insert carbon or
heteroatom functionality into strong C(sp3)–H bonds with ligand-controlled selectivities. Although early- and mid-
first-row transition-metal-oxo complexes have been intensively studied, first-row late-transition-metal-oxo
species (LTM-oxo) are less explored despite their potential utility for C–H oxidation. Indeed, synthesizing LTM-
oxo complexes represents a major challenge toward harnessing these highly reactive species as useful oxidants.
The proposed research aims to develop a modular route toward a series of LTM-oxo complexes bearing a novel
sterically-bulky triptycene-substituted dipyrrin ligand scaffold. This ligand architecture is expected to enforce
kinetic stability of the complexes to facilitate isolation and characterization efforts. The ligand scaffold will also
promote high-spin electronic configurations, which should weaken the M–O bond and render the complexes
more reactive toward C(sp3)–H oxidation. Finally, the reactivity of transiently-formed and sterically encumbered
LTM-oxo complexes will be harnessed to enable the selective and undirected catalytic oxidation of sterically
unhindered methyl groups. This methodology will also be applied toward the selective late-stage functionalization
of medicinally-relevant scaffolds. These efforts will result in the first general method for the catalytic undirected
oxidation of primary C(sp3)–H bonds. Moreover, these studies will provide the first unambiguous characterization
of high-spin LTM-oxo complexes and validate their synthetic utility for catalytic C–H oxidation."
10802407,"Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor of AIDS patients worldwide and is the most commonly
reported tumor in parts of Africa. The predominant tumor cell is the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin.
The etiologic agent of KS is the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV-8), a gamma
herpesvirus. KSHV is latent in greater than 95% of the spindle cells in the tumor, with a low percentage of
spindle cells supporting lytic replication. Infection of endothelial cells in culture leads to similar percentages of
latent and lytic infection leading us to use cultured endothelial cell infection as a model of infection. We have
demonstrated that KSHV dramatically alters endothelial cell metabolism upon infection including induction of
glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid synthesis. Interestingly, all of these metabolic pathways are also
induced in tumor cells from a variety of cancers and are required for the survival of cancer cells. Inhibition of
these pathways induces cell death in latently infected cells but not mock infected cells indicating that this is a
potential therapeutic target for intervention. These pathways center around the mitochondria. In preliminary
data we found that mitochondrial translation is necessary for proliferation and survival of latently infected
cells. In this proposal we will determine the role of the mitochondria in KSHV latency and how KSHV directly
alters the mitochondria leading to altered mitochondrial function. We will also examine how KSHV alteration
of mitochondria alters other metabolic pathways in the latently infected cells. These studies will shed light on
how KSHV latent infection of endothelial cells requires alterations in cellular metabolism for survival through
determination of how KSHV alters cellular stress and mitochondria as well as the viral mechanisms involved.
A number of the mitochondrial pathway examined in this proposal are therapeutic targets with FDA approved
drugs and could potentially be used to target KSHV latent infection and ultimately KS tumors.

environmental and occupational health (EOH) challenges in a context of dynamic political changes, multiple
concurrent humanitarian crises, weak regulations, and limited investment in EOH research and research
capacity building. The American University of Beirut (AUB) in Lebanon (U01 application) is partnering with Yale
University (U2R application) in collaboration with the University of Iowa in the US to establish a Global
Environmental and Occupational Health Research and Training Hub for the MENA region (GEOHealth MENA),
where AUB serves as the Hub Institution and one university in each of Egypt and Sudan will serve as Spoke
Institutions. The aim of GEOHealth MENA is to build and strengthen EOH research capacity in the context of
disadvantaged populations, at AUB, sister institutions, and relevant NGOs in Lebanon and the MENA region.
The focus of the current project will be agricultural health and safety with an emphasis on exposure to pesticide
among refugee populations. The MENA region hosts more than 50% of the world's total population of internally
displaced persons and refugees. The U01 application proposes to evaluate the pathways of pesticide exposure
among Syrian refugee agricultural workers, investigate the association of such exposure with neurobehavioral
outcomes, and explore the role of social factors in this association. Findings will inform policy and practice
guidelines that can improve the health of all agricultural workers. The multidisciplinary research team at AUB
will build on a strong track record of studying refugee and migrant populations and translating evidence into
policy. Yale and the University of Iowa will provide support to the AUB team in exposure assessment and the
assessment of neurobehavioral performance. The U2R will provide full scholarships to 3 highly qualified and
committed applicants (one from each of Egypt, Lebanon, and Sudan) to pursue a PhD in Epidemiology at
AUB's Faculty of Health Sciences (FHS) focusing on EOH issues. The U2R will also provide full scholarships
to 4 highly qualified and committed MDs (two from Lebanon and one from each of Egypt and Sudan) to pursue
an MPH at AUB's FHS and a fellowship in Occupational Medicine at AUB's Faculty of Medicine. The 7 trainees
will spend 3 months (MD/MPH) or 6 months (PhD) during their study period at Yale and Iowa for advanced and
relevant research training and training on agricultural safety and health (AgS&H). Additionally, the U01/U2R
applications will offer short-term research and AgS&H training to the community."

This grant will provide infrastructure support to the University of Colorado Consortium Cancer Center
and its clinical care partner UCHealth to continue to support the specific aims of the grant:
 To lead and participate in scientifically important and clinically relevant NCTN clinical trials.
 To make these trials available to the greatest proportion of the cancer population of Colorado and
Wyoming.
 To rapidly activate, accrue, caringly provide patient coordination, and accurately report research
 related data in a timely way to the NCTN components responsible for conducting these trials.
 To foster and develop young investigators in the NCTN process.
Specific support is requested for the administrative, regulatory, clinical coordination, and data
management needs to conduct clinical trials of the NCTN safely and efficiently on behalf of the cancer
patients in Colorado and our wider catchment area. In addition, we will support enhanced monitoring
and auditing to ensure patient safety and proper conduct of the trials at all our sites of clinical care.
Quality assessment and improvement are a central features of our NCTN program.
We take seriously the mandate to participate in the development of new concepts, the contribution of
our laboratory scientists in these translational projects, and the fostering of new junior investigators to
further the clinical impact of therapeutic trials in the NCTN. Dialog and communication are key. Within
our institution, we have created a superb forum for our investigators across the entire system (the LAPS
Executive Committee) that represents all modalities and disease-oriented groups to prioritize and
commit to new trials, to monitor accrual and any other issues related to the conduct of these trials
across our system. We support travel for investigators, staff, and scientists to participate in the NCTN
meetings and committees.
A new initiative will be supported with this grant. Many of the new trials are multi-oncologic, and/or
require molecular characterization of the patient's tumor to match the patient to appropriate treatment
protocols. Our institution already has a “T3” CRA team to handle multi-oncologic “basket” trials, and we
have a fully functional Molecular Tumor Board. In separate efforts, we are developing patient-specific
molecular databases that will obtain both internal and external molecular tumor data, and will be
searchable. A navigator position to regularly review these databases, the molecularly-driven clinical
trials, and guide patients and clinicians to match the patients to the suitable trials may improve our
accrual to these trials."

Alliance) Leukemia Correlative Science Committee (A-LCSC), and the SWOG Leukemia Translational Medicine
Subcommittee (S-LTMS) and the Broad Institute have elected to joined forces in 2014 and created an Integrated
Translational Science Center for Leukemia (ITSC-L). The overall goal of the ITSC-L is to identify the genetic
and molecular aberrations that characterize leukemic transformation, understand their contribution to therapeutic
response or resistance, and utilize this information for the design of rational therapeutic trials that match specific
molecular aberrations to emerging targeted therapies. These goals will be achieved through the carefully
selection of Pilot Studies that involve outstanding investigators working within Alliance and SWOG and those
working outside the groups. Ultimately, these efforts should not only result in a significant improvement in the
clinical outcome for leukemia patients, but are expected to generate cutting-edge findings applicable to other
types of cancer. The Specific Aims of this Program are the following:
Specific Aim 1. To maintain an Integrated Translational Science Center for Leukemia (ITSC-L) that will
promote research among investigators working within the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)
system and outside the system by providing and coordinating funding, expertise, technology, tissue and
data for innovative studies with clinical relevance; Specific Aim 2. To identify novel prognostic and predictive
genetic and epigenetic markers and therapeutic targets for the development of innovative therapeutic paradigms
that transform the current approach to leukemia patients and improve their cure rate; Specific Aim 3. To rapidly
integrate high impact correlative science into early and late phase therapeutic trials of leukemia supported by
the NCTN."

Breast density is a risk factor for developing breast cancer and decreases the accuracy of screening mammography. An estimated 27 million women aged 40-74 in the U.S. have dense breasts and they experience elevated rates of advanced stage breast cancer diagnoses associated with poor outcomes. Thirty-seven states now require mammography facilities to notify women with dense breasts of the limitations of mammography and recommend discussion of screening options with their healthcare providers, and a national law is pending. In the absence of screening guidelines for women with dense breasts, there has been a dramatic increase in use of supplemental ultrasound screening, which is widely available and has low direct medical costs. Early studies of supplemental ultrasound performance suggest increased cancer detection but high rates of false positive exams leading to unnecessary biopsies. The United States Preventive Services Task Force has called for studies that evaluate the impact of supplemental ultrasound screening on meaningful clinical outcomes, such as advanced cancer rates, to inform screening guidelines for women with dense breasts. We recently demonstrated that mammography screening failure rates (i.e., advanced cancers and interval cancers after a normal mammogram) among women with dense breasts vary widely according to clinical risk factors. Therefore, we propose to assess supplemental ultrasound screening performance within a new risk-based framework. We hypothesize that supplemental ultrasound screening targeted to the subset of women with dense breasts at high risk of mammography screening failures will yield a favorable benefit-to-harm profile. We will use observational data from more than 100,000 screening ultrasound exams and 2 million mammography screening exams collected via the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium to (Aim 1) examine the test performance of supplemental screening ultrasound according to type of primary screening (digital mammography vs. digital breast tomosynthesis); and (Aim 2) evaluate supplemental screening ultrasound outcomes across levels of risk for mammography screening failures. These results will be used as inputs in two simulation models from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network to (Aim 3) evaluate the long-term benefits, harms, and costs of supplemental ultrasound strategies targeted to women at high risk of mammography screening failures. Our study will be the largest evaluation of supplemental ultrasound and the first to evaluate rates of interval and advanced cancers according to risk of mammography screening failures. Our results will provide urgently needed, actionable evidence for women, healthcare providers, and guideline-makers evaluating screening options for women with dense breasts. This evidence will support effective supplemental screening strategies that reduce the burden of breast cancer among women for whom mammography screening is not adequate, while minimizing potential harms."
10795822,"My career goal is to develop an independent research program focused on improving shared
decision making for children with neurologic disease.
 Parents of infants with neurologic conditions frequently face life and death decisions. A good quality
decision in this context is one in which clinicians and parents engage in shared decision making, a process by
which clinicians provide decision-relevant medical information, and partner with parents to help them
incorporate preferences for how to make trade-offs between death and life with disability. Despite the high
frequency and stakes of management decisions in neonatal neurology, we lack 1) empiric data on how these
choices are made and 2) tools to promote good quality decisions through shared decision making.
 The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K23) is to develop a
targeted decision aid for parents of infants with neurologic conditions. We will first characterize decision
making and prognostic discussion in a longitudinal, mixed methods study. We will enroll 50 cases, consisting of
an infant, their parent(s), and their physician(s). We will follow each case along a 6-month trajectory and audio
record parent-clinician conferences as they occur. To complement data from real-time discussions, we will
survey and interview parents after each conference, at infant discharge, and 6 months after infant discharge or
death. Clinicians will complete post-conference surveys. Data analyses will integrate quantitative and
qualitative methodologies. First, we will characterize decision making processes in parent-clinician
conversations using qualitative analysis and established metrics of shared decision making. We will then
analyze the content of prognostic discussion—how parents and clinicians discuss expected infant outcomes—
and determine how often parents and clinicians have a concordant understanding of infant prognosis.
 These data will directly inform the development and testing of a decision aid to enhance shared
decision making for infants with neurologic conditions. We will develop the decision aid using the International
Patient Decision Aids Standards, and will refine the tool through usability and cognitive testing. We will test the
acceptability of the decision aid in a single-arm feasibility study. We will enroll 30 infants with neurologic
conditions, their parent(s), and their physician(s) in advance of a planned goals-of-care conference. Enrolled
parents will receive the decision aid in advance the conference. We will survey parents at baseline; parents
and clinicians will also be surveyed following the goals-of-care conference.
 Upon completion of this Award, I will have the data and skillset necessary to study this intervention in a
randomized control trial, which serve as the basis for a R01 submission. The rigorous training provided by this
Award will prepare me well for a career dedicated to improving parent-clinician communication and decision
making for infants with neurologic conditions."

Airway epithelial cells were originally regarded as an inert barrier to the environment, but are now viewed as key
regulators of the response to injury and infection with a critical role in airway repair that mimics lung development.
Furthermore, altered behavior of this cell population is central to the pathogenesis of common airway diseases
such as asthma and COPD, making it essential to understand the mechanisms responsible to normal and
abnormal programming of this cell population. My research program is thematically focused on airway epithelial
cell programming with the goal of characterizing the molecular basis of airway epithelial cell function and
dysfunction for airway homeostasis versus disease. Our work to date has contributed to new paradigms in airway
epithelial cell biology, including the first evidence of an active role for airway epithelial cells in directing the
immune response towards airway disease and now the first data for an elusive airway progenitor epithelial cell
(APEC) population that can be respiratory-virus activated to orchestrate disease and thereby explain how a
transient infection could lead to long-term disease. Building on this work, we will focus going forward on creating
a new concept for tissue homeostasis versus disease based on a set of transformative paradigms where
progenitor cell reprogramming switches a normal airway epithelial barrier to one dominated by mucus production
and the consequent morbidity and mortality of airway disease. We will provide the first definition of the key
population of airway progenitor epithelial cells and the first mechanisms for how these cells are switched to
disease-producing cells, incorporating unprecedented roles for: (1) endogenous viral, water channel, and
nucleokine control of mitotic chromatin in these cells; and (2) an exogenous danger loop from these cells to
immune cells and back to drive a distinct progenitor-cell kinase now targeted with structure-based drug design
to interrupt mucus production. Translational impact also derives from new mouse and pig models and validation
in humans with comparable disease. This substrate is combined with new approaches to cell isolation, 3D
manipulation, and transplantation based on targets identified from genomic and proteomic analyses. Each of the
individual approaches within the overall Program is charged to investigators in training to integrate scientific
career development into the mission for medical research and discovery. In addition, the Program relies on vital
and sophisticated input from senior pulmonary scientists for additional mentoring and cutting-edge approaches
and innovations. The Program also incorporates the wider University and extramural resources to deploy
multidisciplinary technologies with outstanding collaborators. Together, we expect our Program to provide a
transformative paradigm for true progenitor epithelial cell programming and its role in cell proliferation and
differentiation, including skewing towards mucous cell formation and excess mucus production that is central to
airway disease. We also fully expect that our studies will identify the first tractable cellular and molecular targets
and corresponding therapeutic intervention to attenuate airway disease, consistent with the mission of NHLBI."
10794804,"Research Summary/Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the leading
causes of chronic liver disease that can progress into a more advanced form- non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) featuring inflammation and fibrosis. There is no specific medicine for
advanced NASH patients, making it critical to find supplements to mitigate liver damage. Non-
psychoactive cannabinoids cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) has shown anti-
inflammatory effect in other diseases, but their therapeutic effect in NAFLD/NASH is unknown.
The goal of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of CBG with or without CBD intervention to
reduce NAFLD/NASH. We have found that administration of CBG in diet-induced NAFLD/NASH
leads to decreases in hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine secretion in
the liver. Based on these data, we hypothesize that Cannabinoids attenuate immune cell
recruitment, suppresses inflammatory mediator release, and thus mitigate liver damage caused
by diet in mice. We propose three specific aims to address the hypothesis: (i) Evaluate the
administration of CBG with or without CBD in alleviating the symptoms of NAFLD and NASH,
specifically liver steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress, in two mouse models. (ii)
Assess the expansion of T cells and mast cells across immune compartments. (iii) Evaluate
crosstalk between PPARg activation and the TGF-β1 pathway in different cell populations in the
liver. C57BL/6 mice will receive special diets to develop NAFLD/NASH symptoms and then be
administered with CBG with or without the combination of CBD. The liver, peripheral blood, and
spleen will be examined for cellular and secreted indicators of inflammation. Cytokines, including
TGF-β1 and its pathway, will be evaluated in isolated hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and immune
cell subsets via total RNA sequencing, multiplex cytometry bead assay, and qRT-PCR. Further,
cannabinoid receptors and their downstream pathways will be evaluated with or without
cannabinoid treatment in vivo and in vitro. We predict CBG alone or with CBD will protect the liver
from NAFLD/NASH symptoms and inhibit immune cell infiltration into the liver via TGF-b1 involved
pathway and PPARg (CBG receptor) activation. This research will provide therapeutic efficacy
data about CBG and CBD for NAFLD/NASH for the first time in mice, which will benefit future
cannabinoid-related animal and human studies. Further, we will provide in-depth information
about molecular mechanisms in which CBG alone or with CBD diminishes NAFLD/NASH
progression. Through these aims, we will build a rigorous body of evidence about the effect of
cannabinoids during the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH."

The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School seeks funding to continue its summer undergraduate
research program for undergraduates from groups traditionally underrepresented – by race, ethnicity, economic
and education disadvantage and disability status – in the biomedical sciences. The research training
opportunities available through this short-term training experience span the range from basic to translational to
clinical/epidemiologic research. Therefore, the program is very well suited to support the research interests of a
broad range of trainees. Many of these research training experiences are in areas supported within the research
portfolio of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Importantly, UMass Chan Medical School provides a
very intensive research environment attracting almost $300 million in research funding in 2021.
The NIH funded program will support 16 trainees annually, a number readily justified by the large number of high
caliber applications received by the program each year. The program also benefits from sustained and significant
investment by UMass Chan in the form of personnel and direct financial support. This financial support provides
funds each year for an additional 10 trainees, most of whom do not meet NIH eligibility criteria. This support
additionally allows the program to provide critical activities and materials for the trainees, the costs of which are
not allowable under the NIH award.
The UMass Chan summer undergraduate research program is a highly structured residential program. Students
perform research in a group aligned with their interests. Students are introduced to critical tenets of Responsible
Conduct of Research that support rigor and reproducibility and ethical research conduct. Students enhance their
scientific communication skills through a series of small group sessions led by junior faculty and postdocs,
culminating in a poster presentation at the end of the program. A research lecture series and luncheon research
discussions expose participants to a broad range of research areas, potentially expanding the range of their
scientific interests, while also expanding their professional networks. Networking sessions with key leaders and
program directors at UMass Chan demystify the application process for doctoral degree programs and provide
additional opportunities for network growth. Program-organized social activities, to which former program
participants are invited, support social and professional networks. Program participants are also included in
institution-wide social activities at which current UMass Chan students are present, to enhance their sense of
belonging at the institution.
Participant outcomes indicate the impact of the program. Of 550 unique NIH-funded participants, 249 (45%)
have completed or are enrolled in a doctoral degree program - 185 in MD or DO programs, 54 in PhD programs,
and 10 in combined MD/PhD programs. Continued NIH funding will allow this successful program to continue for
an additional five year period."
10796849,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cyclin C was cloned, along with other G1 cyclins, as a cDNA which can rescue the proliferative block in yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking CLN1, CLN2 and CLN3 genes. Subsequent work revealed that cyclin C,
acting together with its kinase partners, the cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and CDK19, plays a role in
regulating gene transcription. Cyclin C serves as a regulatory partner of CDK8 and CDK19, and activates the
kinase activity of these proteins. The two paralog kinases show substantial overall amino acid identity,
particularly within their catalytic domains. Cyclin C, CDK8 and CDK19 represent parts of the mediator
complex, a large multisubunit protein complex that regulates gene transcription by linking RNA polymerase II to
sequence-specific transcription factors. In addition, cyclin C-CDK8/19 was shown to phosphorylate various
transcription factors and to regulate their stability and activity. Growing evidence indicates that cyclin C-CDK8
and C-CDK19 kinases may represent potential anti-cancer targets. CDK8 has been identified as an oncogene
in several human cancers. Cyclin C, CDK8 and CDK19 are overexpressed in a wide range of tumor types.
Importantly, higher expression of these three proteins was found to be associated with poor clinical outcome.
Consistent with tumor-promoting roles for cyclin C-CDK8/19, treatment of mice bearing xenografts of several
human tumor types with small molecule CDK8/19 inhibitors resulted in a potent anti-tumor effect without
apparent systemic toxicity. To understand the molecular function of cyclin C in vivo, we generated conditional
cyclin C knockout mice (cyclin CF/F). To test the impact of cyclin C-CDK8/19 inhibition on T cell development
and adaptive anti-tumor immunity, we crossed cyclin CF/F mice with CD4-Cre animals. The latter strain
expresses Cre recombinase at an early stage of T cell development, and drives deletion of the ‘floxed’
sequences in all T cell subsets. In our preliminary analyses we established that cyclin C functions as a gate-
keeper of T cell differentiation, likely by directly phosphorylating a lineage-specific transcription factor. By
doing so, cyclin C affects signaling networks that regulate the immune response. Hence, this novel function of
cyclin C may have a profound effect on the anti-tumor immune response and on tumorigenesis. In the
proposed work we will extend these studies. In Aim 1, we will study the exact molecular function of cyclin C-
CDK8 and C-CDK19 in the T cell lineage using a combination of biochemical in vitro studies, cell culture
experiments, analyses of ex vivo cultured T cells as well as mouse genetic approaches. In Aim 2, we will study
how ablation of cyclin C impacts tumorigenesis in vivo, using mouse cancer models and combination
treatments with other anti-cancer modalities. In Aim 3, we will extend these cancer studies to cyclin C catalytic
partners, using conditional Cdk19 knockout mice (Cdk19F/F), that my laboratory generated for this purpose.
The expected overall impact of this proposal is that it will reveal a novel and important function of cyclin C-
CDK8 and C-CDK19 in tumorigenesis, and will validate these kinases as attractive therapeutic targets."

The pulmonary fibrosis that accompanies many conditions is characterized by progressive scar formation in the
adult human lung. Regardless of the underlying disease state, the presence of this complication portends a
worse outcome that is curable only by lung transplantation. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms suggest a poorly
understood interaction between epithelial cells and fibroblasts that is orchestrated by microenvironmental cues.
Understanding these aspects in the fibrotic microenvironment is of particular importance in diseases such as
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) where patients present with established and often progressive disease. As
a result, identification of intervenable processes that can be targeted for safe and effective therapies remains a
critical unmet need. It is therefore relevant that in a groundbreaking set of studies we have found that fibrotic
lungs are enriched for ectopically patterned adrenergic nerves, that these nerves drive fibrosis by releasing NA,
that NA driven fibrosis can be treated with α1 adrenoreceptor antagonists. This axis is active in IPF where lung
tissues are enriched for markers of adrenergic innervation and NA, and patients treated with α1 adrenoreceptor
antagonists experience improved clinical outcomes. We will now determine how NA accumulates in fibrotic
lungs and define its fibrogenic functions. For example, while we have found that adrenergic nerve remodeling
is stimulated by the dependence receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC), the mechanism(s) of this
observation are unknown. We have found that fibrotic lung macrophages are deficient in NA catabolism
machinery, but whether they contribute to fibrosis via perturbed NA recycling has not been shown. Finally, we
have found an association between fibroblast proliferation and α1 adrenoreceptor subtype ADRA1D in fibrotic
mouse models and in human IPF that requires more study. This application will explore the mechanistic impact
and therapeutic potential of these findings using a unified vision and conceptual framework that will study how
nerve-derived NA accumulates in the lung and causes fibrosis. We propose an integrated project that pursues
three independent aims using a translational platform combining two animal models, manipulation of adrenergic
nerves, neuroengineering, cell specific knockout mice, genetic and pharmacologic gain and loss of function
approaches, ex vivo study of human cells and tissues, single cell sequencing, and microCT. The first aim will
probe whether adrenergic nerve remodeling and accumulation of fibrostimulatory NA requires expression of the
dependence receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) on adrenergic nerves in the lung. The second aim
will determine if perturbed NA recycling by macrophages exacerbates fibrosis in animal models and in human
cells and tissues. The third aim will use cell specific knockout mice and primary human cells and tissues to
determine wither NA-associated lung fibrosis requires ADRA1D-expressing fibroblasts. If successful, our project
will produce paradigm shifting results that will change the way we view – and treat – fibrosis in the adult lung."
10796859,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The RAS family comprised of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS are the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human
cancer. Despite there being over 50 possible oncogenic RAS mutations, each cancer type has a specific and
often unique subset of these mutations. As RAS mutations typically occur early during tumorigenesis, if not
being the initiating mutation, these mutational patterns reflect fundamental biology underlying the process of
tumor initiation. Elucidating the mechanisms giving rise to RAS mutation patterns would therefore address
a foundational question in cancer biology- how cancer originates. Given this, the most informative approach to
interrogate these patterns is to study RAS mutations when they 1) first occur in 2) normal cells in an 3) in vivo
setting. Trying to backtrack to catch that one random mutagenic event in one gene from one cell that initiates
cancer decades before manifesting as a disease is challenging in humans. There are, however, two murine
model systems that allow an initiating RAS mutation to be precisely defined, and hence are amenable to studying
RAS mutation patterns. One, carcinogenesis, which is particularly well suited to interrogate how the mutagenic
process gives rise to RAS mutation patterns. Two, genetic activation of mutant alleles in a spatially and
temporally restricted fashion, which is ideal to study the response of defined Ras mutations in normal cells. We
thus propose to capitalize on the individual strengths of these two different models to elucidate the mechanisms
by which RAS mutation patterns are laid down in normal cells at the very onset of tumorigenesis in vivo.
Specifically, in aim 1 we will determine how tumors arise by a specific Ras mutation by monitoring mutagenesis
immediately after carcinogen exposure and thereafter in genetic backgrounds that alter RAS mutation patterns.
In aim 2 we will determine the signaling and cellular responses of different normal cells upon genetic induction
of different oncogenic Ras mutants. Completion of this proposal will thus elucidate the principles underlying the
selection for specific RAS mutations in human cancers, and more broadly, how cancers originate, which has
clinical implications for early detection and prevention."

 There is an urgent need to increase the numbers and diversity of bioinformatics-trained scientists
joining the biomedical and clinical workforce. For bioinformatics to be considered a career choice by
students from underrepresented groups, it is critical to develop awareness of bioinformatics in high school.
A strength of bioinformatics is that it can be integrated into existing biological content and can strengthen
connections between biological topics in a typical high school biology curriculum. The Authentic
Bioinformatics in the Classroom (ABC) Project utilizes the power of bioinformatics to bring context to
biology and integrate bioinformatics in high school biology classes. By developing bioinformatics
discovery and research-centered investigations for high school students (as modules throughout the school
year), bioinformatics and scientific research become a natural part of biology. Here, evidence-based
bioinformatics curricular materials for high school biology will be developed in collaboration with high
school biology teachers, to promote mastery of biological sciences while stimulating interest and awareness
of bioinformatics among high school students from underrepresented backgrounds - thus, enabling them to
pursue biomedical and clinical research careers including bioinformatics. To prepare teachers for
developing bioinformatics curricular materials, they will participate in a research-oriented bioinformatics
lab where they will learn the bioinformatics concepts and skills necessary to refine a bioinformatics draft
curriculum (developed by the project team and approved by an External Advisory Committee) so that it can
be authentically implemented in their high school classrooms. The curriculum will follow successful
Modeling Instruction practices for which the project team has extensive experience. The curriculum will
develop NGSS practices and be aligned to several NGSS topics and cross-cutting concepts, while engaging
students through basic bioinformatics, data science, and research. To disseminate the curriculum, the project
will provide professional development workshops for high school teachers to develop teachers’
bioinformatics knowledge and skills, engage them in the curriculum through experiential learning
opportunities, and provide opportunities for practice and reflection. Teachers will be supported through
their implementation of the curriculum by providing structured support from the project team, prepared
undergraduate students (Bioinformatics Ambassadors (BAs)), district curriculum support specialists, as
well as a developing teacher learning community. The BAs will also serve as near-peer mentors and role
models in the teachers’ classrooms based on an adaption of the successful Learning Assistant model."

 My career goal is to a lead a research group that investigates the neurocognitive development of
motivationally-salient memory formation and how persistent memories influence behaviors that can increase
risk for substance use disorders. To acquire the necessary skills to lead a team pursuing this line of research, I
propose a project that aims to examine the neural mechanisms underlying reward-motivated memory, the
influence of previously learned reward value on new learning, and the impact of real-world positive affect states
on memory processes from childhood to adulthood. My training to date has provided me with a strong
methodological and theoretical foundation in developmental cognitive neuroscience and basic behavioral
neuroscience research. My career development plan builds on this knowledge base by providing crucial,
intensive training in the study of reward-motivated memory and its relation to addiction, multivariate analyses of
neuroimaging data, computational modeling, and ecological momentary assessment methods. Completion of
the proposed research and training will prepare me to lead a lab that uses a translational approach to study
appetitive and aversive motivated memory processes and how they guide future behaviors across
development, using sophisticated computational and neuroimaging approaches.
 Research Project: Experimentation with addictive substances often begins during adolescence,
increasing the risk of progression to addiction. Normative developmental changes in mesolimbic dopamine
systems, which drive adolescent reward sensitivity and motivated behaviors, alongside changes in
hippocampal memory systems may yield vulnerability to substance abuse during adolescence. While a rich
body of research has focused on how reward sensitivity drives reactive and consummatory behaviors during
adolescence, few studies have investigated how this sensitivity shapes memory and future choices. The goal
of the proposed research is to investigate age-related changes in reward-motivated memory persistence that
may contribute to substance abuse from childhood to adulthood, spanning the transition into and out of
adolescence. We hypothesize that adolescent reward sensitivity enhances the persistence of reward-motivated
memories, yielding greater susceptibility to substance abuse. The first study (Aim 1) will identify age-related
changes in the neural mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memories. The second study (Aim 2) will
determine how reward-motivated experiences and related brain activity influence subsequent learning across
age. Finally, the third study will investigate how real-world affective states influence memory and its relation to
substance use and mesolimbic dopamine system connectivity across age (Aim 3). Understanding the
neurocognitive mechanisms through which rewards modulate memory and guide future behaviors across age
– both in the lab and in the real-world – may provide key insights into how to help prevent substance use
disorders and to promote a healthy transition into adulthood."
10796864,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of our research is to understand the mechanisms that regulate growth: at the level of the
individual cell, at the level of organs and at an organismal level. In order to study the regulation of growth, we
have studied the imaginal discs of Drosophila, the larval precursors of adult structures such as the wing.
Until recently, an important limitation to our work was that we had few tools to study the cellular heterogeneity
that is a key feature of growth regulation in vivo. Single-cell transcriptomics allows us to characterize small
subsets of cells that have a major impact on growth regulation. By combining this approach with experimental
genetics, we can now study a key aspects of growth regulation that involves heterotypic interactions between
small subsets of cells.
We aim to obtain a better understanding of the genetic regulation of regenerative growth. We have identified a
gene regulatory network that is entirely dispensable for normal development but is essential for regenerative
growth. Additional genes identified from our single-cell studies point to genes that are specifically expressed in
different portions of the regeneration blastema and which likely regulate different aspects of regeneration
including proliferation, cell shape and cell-fate plasticity. We will characterize the function of these genes. We
have also found that damage and regeneration of one portion of the disc can impact the development of the
remainder of the disc and also distant organs. Another goal is to elucidate the mechanistic basis of these long-
range phenomena.
We will examine the role of ion channels in regulating Hedgehog signaling and the growth and patterning of the
of the wing disc. We will determine why cells with a more depolarized membrane potential survive
preferentially in the anterior compartment of the wing disc. We will also study the properties of the
mechanosensitive channel Piezo in growth regulation.
Finally, by combining our single cell atlas of the wing disc with a genetic screen, we have identified many
genes encoding poorly-characterized cell-surface proteins and ligand-receptor pairs that likely function during
development to regulate cell survival, cell proliferation and planar cell polarity. We will study these genes."

 Targeting estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a major anticancer strategy in the treatment of ERα-positive
breast cancer. However, current targeted therapies for ERα have only cytostatic activity and do not induce rapid
quantitative killing of cancer cells, ultimately leading to resistance. A major resistance mechanism is ERα
mutation leading to constitutively activation that drives tumor growth and metastasis, with Y537S and D538G
accounting for the majority of driver mutations. These resistant tumors maintain overexpression of ERα,
suggesting an opportunity to develop novel small molecules that can leverage aberrant ERαWT/Mut expression.
 We have discovered one such compound, ErSO, that has profound cytotoxic activity against ERαWT/Mut
positive cancer cells, via rapid activation of the ERαWT/Mut-dependent anticipatory unfolded protein response
(aUPR). The power of this cytotoxic activity has been observed with multiple examples of complete eradications
of ERαWT/Mut-positive breast tumors in orthotopic and metastatic murine models. While there is a high translational
potential for ErSO with a Phase 1 clinical trial planned for 2020, herein we discuss features of ErSO that
demonstrate ErSO may only be an ideal candidate treating brain metastases. There is ample need for a second-
generation ErSO with better pharmacokinetic properties and safer toxicity profile for the treatment of ERα-
positive cancer. Planned work (F99 phase) consists of synthesizing more polar derivatives of ErSO, which will
be assessed in mechanistic studies, in vivo tolerability, blood-brain barrier penetration, and efficacy models.
These second generation compounds will likely have increased bioavailability, minimal neurotoxicity, and a safer
toxicity profile, enabling their translational potential for addressing the treatment of ERα-positive cancer.
 While targeted anticancer therapy has altered the clinical landscape for challenging cancers, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) remains highly lethal with a rising mortality and incidence rate. HCC is vastly heterogenous
disease with the only conserved driver mutations found in TERT and CTNNB1, which currently lie in the
‘undruggable’ target space. Herein, I describe efforts study CTNNB1 mutant allele imbalance (MAI) as a measure
of CTNNB1 oncogenic addiction and propose in-depth cellular studies to annotate the impact of CTNNB1 MAI
on oncogenic metabolism (K00 Phase). This exploration will provide insights into potential therapeutic targets
for the treatment of HCC.
 These F99/K00 proposals seek produce a well-rounded, in-depth skill set to prepare me for success as an
independent PI. Specifically, the F99 proposed work will refine my work in drug discovery and small molecule
development. Planned K00 work will expand my expertise with new experiences in managing complex data sets
to elucidate conclusions about fundamental cancer biology. Completion of this training will produce a powerful
basis for my career in developing novel translational solutions for clinical oncology."

 Telehealth is defined as the remote provision of health care and education. Its use greatly increased as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to continue being widely used. The problem is the lack of
understanding on how to best offer telehealth to adolescents. This study will interview 105 adolescents to ask
about their perspectives on the benefits of, challenges with, and suggestions for improving telehealth.
 Pediatric research regarding perspectives on telehealth focused primarily on parents/caregivers who
offered opinions on behalf of their adolescents. Our preliminary qualitative study using surveys and interviews
with parents/caregivers revealed that it was important to interview adolescents to better understand how to
improve telehealth. We identified studies in the U.S.A. that interviewed 15 to 38 adolescents on benefits and
challenges of telehealth but not on suggestions for improvement.
 We have established relationships with pediatrician offices that have participated in research with us in
the past and that will assist with recruitment of adolescents in Genesee County, Michigan. A total of 105
individuals aged 14 to 17 will participate in a 1-hour online or telephone interview to offer their perspectives on
telehealth. Questions as part of the interview will build on concepts in the “Telemedicine and doctor-patient
communication” theoretical framework. Parents/caregivers will complete a survey to provide the socio-
demographic information of their adolescent and household. Adolescents should have used any telehealth at
least once over the past year to be eligible to participate. Qualitative analyses of the interview transcripts and
quantitative analyses of surveys will take place. Four university students will be a part of the research team.
Students will receive training on qualitative research and ethical issues, develop study materials, conduct
interviews, perform qualitative and quantitative data analyses, and engage in manuscript writing for publication.
They will present in at least one national conference.
 Through interviewing adolescents, the specific aims are to: 1) Describe the benefits of, challenges with,
and suggestions for improving synchronous (i.e., video visits) and asynchronous (i.e., mobile applications)
telehealth; 2) Compare benefits, challenges, and suggestions between adolescents of different socio-
demographic groups; 3) Based on the findings from aims 1-2, develop a conceptual framework on factors that
promote effective communication between adolescents and healthcare providers and subsequently improve
health outcomes through telehealth.
 Understanding telehealth perspectives among adolescents can develop youth-specific health care
improvements such as more effective communication with the healthcare provider. Future randomized-
controlled trials developed based on the suggestions offered by the adolescents in the proposed study have
great potential in improving youth’s satisfaction with health care and health outcomes."

(PC) is associated with positive health outcomes such as symptom relief and improved quality of life, older
adults with cancer utilize PC services to a lesser extent than their younger counterparts. They request not to be
referred to PC or miss PC appointments when referred and delay PC until symptoms are uncontrollable or end
of life is near. This low uptake of PC could stem from negative views of PC, lack of knowledge or awareness of
PC, or the notion that they don’t ‘need’ PC or are not ‘ready’ for PC. Measuring readiness for early PC may
increase the uptake of PC by increasing knowledge and awareness of PC and debunking negative perceptions
of PC among older adults with cancer. Unfortunately, there are no tools available to measure readiness for
early PC among adults or older adults with cancer. Thus, there is a critical need to develop and validate a tool
that measures readiness for early PC in this group. To fulfill this gap, we propose developing the Palliative
Care Readiness tool (PALCARE) that measures early PC readiness in older adults with cancer and establish
its content validity and preliminary convergent validity and test-retest reliability. The project has three specific
aims: a) develop the PALCARE tool to measure PC readiness in older adults with cancer; b) establish the
content validity of the PALCARE tool; c) establish the preliminary convergent validity and test-retest reliability
of the PALCARE tool. Results of this study will allow the primary oncology team to measure readiness for early
PC in older adults with cancer and provide targeted PC that is congruent with their readiness level. The
PALCARE tool will also help clinicians educate and support older adults with cancer who are not yet ready for
PC. Ultimately the use of PALCARE can improve early PC utilization among older adults with cancer and
improve their quality of life. Upon successfully completing this project, we will seek extramural funding from
National Institute of Health for R15 renewal or R21 to further establish the psychometric validity and reliability
of the PALCARE tool. Subsequently, we would seek R01 funding to conduct an intervention study that would
examine the effectiveness of the PALCARE tool and develop targeted interventions to improve health
outcomes in older adults with cancer. This project also provides opportunity for hands-on research training for
several graduate and undergraduate students from the fields of nursing and health sciences. With expertise in
instrument development, palliative care, and geriatric oncology, our interdisciplinary research team is well
suited to conduct the proposed study. This project will enhance the research environment at the growing
University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a large and diverse body of undergraduate students."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disease currently without a cure that results in destruction of insulin-
producing β cells of the pancreas via an autoimmune response. T1D treatment requires insulin administration
and greatly reduces life quality and expectancy. Development and persistence of islet autoimmunity (IA) can be
determined by circulating autoantibodies against islet proteins. However, novel biomarkers are needed to: 1)
better understand the mechanisms that trigger and drive IA; and 2) predict individual progression through the
stages of the disease. To identify new biomarkers, we have recently completed a plasma proteomics analysis
for The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY). This nested case-control study 1
(NCC1) included 401 children who developed IA (at median age of 21 months) and 94 children who progressed
to clinical T1D (at median age of 29 months), matched against controls. We identified 376 proteins as candidate
biomarkers; 83 of these proteins were validated as significant predictors of either IA or progression to T1D in
longitudinal analyses of 6,426 samples. We also identified panels of proteins that can predict, with high accuracy,
development of islet autoimmunity (AUC=0.918) and progression to T1D (AUC=0.871) 6 months prior to
seroconversion by machine learning analysis. Limitations of the TEDDY NCC1 included limited follow-up and
very young age (≤6 years) of the participants. IA and progression to T1D can occur over a much broader age
range, and the cellular and systemic processes involved may differ in younger vs older children. In the next case
control study 2 (NCC2), TEDDY monitored individuals until 15 years of age, an additional 501 participants
developed IA (at median age of 89 months) and an additional 345 progressed to T1D (at median age of 108
months). Here we propose to perform a longitudinal analysis of the NCC2 samples with a highly multiplexed,
sensitive, and robust targeted proteomics analysis to simultaneously validate biomarkers identified in the NCC1
and to provide information about the biological processes regulated during disease development. More
specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (I) validate predictive biomarkers of islet autoimmunity; (II)
validate predictive biomarkers of progression to T1D; and (III) determine mechanisms underlying development
of IA and progression to T1D. To fulfill these aims we will perform a large-scale targeted proteomics analysis of
8 time points from 48 months pre-seroconversion to 12 months post-seroconversion of individuals that only
developed islet autoimmunity and individuals that developed clinical diabetes, paired with controls, totaling 6,400
samples. The results of this project should bring the field one step closer to developing clinical biomarkers and
associated assays that can predict all phases of T1D development in addition to identifying possible causes.
This knowledge gained will likely open opportunities to develop preventive interventions against T1D."

Meiosis is a tightly controlled process during which the diploid genome must segregate into haploid
gametes (i.e. eggs or sperm). Inheritance of the incorrect number of chromosomes causes fertility
and birth defects. However, the causes of chromosome missegregation are not always conserved
between chromosomes and the reasons for inter-chromosomal differences are still unknown. One key
contributor appears to be either a complete loss of crossing over or abnormal crossover placement.
Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model to better elucidate the regulation of chromosome-
specific crossing over and the effects on chromosome segregation. In most cases, mutants that
disrupt crossing over do so uniformly across the genome making it difficult to understand how
chromosome-specific defects occur. However, a recently identified set of mutants in a partial loss-of-
function synaptonemal complex mutant exhibit substantially different defects in pairing and recombination
on the X chromosome and the autosomes. The synaptonemal complex is a conserved meiotic structure
that holds homologous chromosomes together and is necessary for crossing over to occur. The long-
term goal of this project is to investigate how the synaptonemal complex regulates chromosome-
specific recombination and meiotic behaviors necessary for segregation. This work will investigate 1)
the role of the synaptonemal complex in regulating the recombination landscape and 2) the
importance of chromosome structure informing meiotic behaviors. Furthermore, this project will
establish a new toolkit for analyzing individual chromosomes. Overall, this project will provide insights
into both the regulation of crossover location and meiotic chromosome biology. By studying the
importance of individual chromosome behaviors and the synaptonemal complex in recombination,
substantial advances can be made in understand the biology underlying the development of
aneuploidies."

Hyperglycemia is a common metabolic problem with a profound impact on pregnancy outcomes. Even modest
elevations in blood glucose during gestation are associated with a multitude of pregnancy complications,
including fetal growth abnormalities, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, and neonatal
morbidity. Manifestation of metabolic disease in pregnancy foreshadows future diabetes and cardiovascular
risk in both affected individuals and their children. Over the past two decades, there have been remarkable
advances in understanding of diabetes pathophysiology, application of diabetes technology, and novel
diabetes therapeutics. Yet, many these innovations have not reached the obstetric population, in part because
of the by-default exclusion of pregnant and lactating individuals from clinical research studies. To address this
problem, we need to train a new generation of diabetes researchers that has the expertise to rigorously
conduct studies in pregnancy. This new generation of investigators should reflect the diversity of the people
affected by hyperglycemia, who are disproportionately from minoritized and marginalized groups.
The Principal Investigator (PI) has a longstanding commitment to mentoring future physicians and scientists,
with a special emphasis on trainees that are from backgrounds underrepresented in biomedical research. The
goal of this proposal is to support the PI’s high-quality mentorship of graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows from underrepresented backgrounds in diabetes and pregnancy investigation. The PI’s interdisciplinary
NIH-funded research program applies advances in physiologic and genetic profiling, as well as diabetes
technologies, to improve the understanding of glycemia in pregnancy and inform new approaches to the care
of pregnant and lactating individuals with diabetes. The PI has had continuous NIDDK funding since joining the
faculty of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Her funded research projects and
other available datasets provide a rich training-ground for mentee projects in the investigation of diabetes,
metabolic disease, and other related disorders in pregnancy.
During the grant period the PI will RECRUIT (Aim 1), TRAIN (Aim 2), SUPPORT (Aim 3), and SPONSOR (Aim 4) at
least 8 trainees at the graduate student or postdoctoral fellow level from underrepresented backgrounds. With
access to exceptional institutional resources and the PI’s scientific program, mentees will succeed in building
independent research careers and deliver biomedical advances in diabetes to pregnant and lactating
individuals."
10796137,"Project Summary
 Over the past decade, there has been a growing epidemic of physician burnout, driven most notably, by
Electronic Health Records (EHR), and the increasing amount of time providers spend on them. A number of
solutions have been developed to untether the provider from the EHR. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the two
most widely adopted solutions were Speech Recognition (SR) and Medical Scribes (MS). The pandemic has
worsened many of these preexisting issues with EHR, and with the broad adoption of telemedicine, creating new
sociotechnical concerns. Fueled in part by this, 2 additional solutions, Virtual Scribes (VS) and Digital Scribes
(DS) have begun to be employed for both in-person and telemedicine visits. We have previously performed a
mixed methods evaluation of MS documenting significant barriers to successful adoption with significant variance
in practice and outcomes. In spite of this rapid expansion of options, there is little information available directly
to compare and contrast the ways they are co-opting provider work in the EHR, or their impact on provider activity
in the EHR, medical record completion/accuracy, and safety issues. At OHSU, providers who adopt MS have
baseline longer times to chart completion and significant greater amount of after-hours record completion, and
use of a MS or SR had no impact on these metrics, with many, higher performing providers, worsening with MS
adoption. These trends persisted and even widened with the use of telemedicine. The goal of this project is to
expand upon these initial findings and use a mixed methods approach to determine the impact of EHR
documentation assistance solutions on EHR use and provider workflow in ambulatory care. In Aim #1, we will
adapt the Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) for in-person and virtual evaluation to expand on our prior work
with MS to evaluate the impact of MS, VS, SR, and DS on provider workflow in the context of in-person and
telemedicine visits. We will then convene a multidisciplinary stakeholder group to review these findings to come
up with a series of metrics, both quantitative and simulation based, to allow for assessment of the 4 modalities.
In Aim #2, we will use EHR audit logs to determine the impact of adoption of each of these 4 modalities, including
data from OHSU and Medstar Health to improve generalizability, control for various EHR systems and allow for
anchoring back to the qualitative data in Aim #1. In Aim #3, we will use the data from the first 2 aims, to create
a high-fidelity simulation to all for direct head-to-head comparison of the 4 modalities on measures not reliably
extracted from EHR audit logs including note accuracy, time-on-task, EHR navigation and patient-provider
communication. In Aim #4, we will define and create a success matrix for selection of DA modalities to guide
decision making on the use of appropriate DA resources for a given specialty type and location. We will also
create a Documentation Assistance Dashboard (DAD) to allow for real-time, longitudinal monitoring of the
various modalities across specialties."

Biomolecular condensates are diverse and abundant membrane-less organelles that partition the intracellular
environment into functionally distinct compartments containing specific sets of molecules and reactions.
Biomolecular condensates participate in various essential housekeeping, stress-response, or cell type-specific
processes. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies have linked the physiological state of a cell or the
spatial locations of condensates in a cell with the composition of the condensates. Thus, to understand the
functions of biomolecular condensates, it is important to know how the molecular content in the condensates
change in health vs. disease or in different spatial locations. In this proposal, we aim to develop a novel spatial
genomics platform that will enable multi-modal molecular characterization of biomolecular condensates at the
sub-micron scale. This will be revolutionary for studying the functional roles of biomolecular condensates in
cellular processes under homeostatic and pathological conditions. Our tools will enable us to look at the
genome, epigenome, and transcriptome within the condensates in a spatially resolved manner all under native
cell and tissue context. We will ensure these novel genomic tools are easy to use and adopt. The successful
completion of this work will lead to a comprehensive toolset for understanding cell and tissue biology from the
perspective of biomolecular condensates."

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with an even greater burden of major disability. It occurs at all ages with the greatest incidence in the elderly. The number of strokes is expected to rise in the US and worldwide as the population ages.  In 2013, NINDS established NIH Stroke Net to harness the leadership and experience of the stroke research field to efficiently create and complete high-quality, multi-site trials and related biomarker validation and ancillary studies spanning prevention, treatment, and recovery. Since inception, the National Clinical Coordinating Center (NCC) at the University of Cincinnati has provided overall leadership and has coordinated activities within NIH Stroke Net. Our central objective is to engage the broader stroke community to successfully and efficiently design trials that are scientifically important, innovative, and feasible; to start trials expeditiously after being funded by NINDS; to successfully recruit and retain representative participants of the US population, and to maintain a pipeline of new clinical trialists by guiding the training, education, and career development of Stroke Net’s fellows and clinical research professionals. In addition to providing overall leadership and coordination for 24-27 regional coordinating centers affiliated with 500+ potential study sites, the NCC includes the Stroke Net research pharmacy and imaging activities. Our NCC team consists of two MPIs with over 50 years of collective experience designing, implementing, and completing multi-site clinical trials; over 30 NCC staff with in-depth expertise in coordinating, contracting, regulatory, pharmacy and imaging activities; a high level of support from University of Cincinnati; over 20 NCC co-investigators across the US with established expertise in the broad range of cerebrovascular disease and trial methodologies; and numerous international collaborators.  From a scientific standpoint, we have established three stroke working groups (acute, prevention and recovery/rehabilitation) that are led by clinical investigator leaders with appropriate expertise from participating Stroke Net sites in the U.S. These working groups offer feedback to the PIs of clinical trial proposals regarding design and feasibility. We have three cores: (1) Fellow Education/Training, (2) Clinical Research Professional (CRP) Education/Training (new), and (3) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (new); and four advisory committees: (1) Patient Representation and Advocacy (new), (2) Pediatrics, (3) Preclinical Science (new), and (4) Tele Stroke. The NCC manages Central IRBs at UC and Advarra for all ongoing Stroke Net studies, one of the largest IRB reliance networks in the U.S. The NCC is responsible for clinical trial agreements (CTAs) for participating hospital sites (nearly 1000 CTAs in last five-year cycle), all financial payments to participating sites, and the overall clinical study management of ongoing trials with the respective trial PIs. Finally, the NCC provides education and training regarding stroke and stroke research to a broad base of stroke fellows and clinical research professionals within NIH Stroke Net."
10799573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a chronic hemolytic anemia that dramatically increases the risk of central nervous
system complications including silent cerebral infarcts (SCI), overt strokes, and intracranial stenosis. Stroke risk
screening procedures for adults with SCA are considerably underdeveloped compared to procedures for children
with SCA and other populations of adults at risk for stroke. However, SCI and overt stroke risk persists across
the lifespan, and SCIs occur in more than 50% of adults with SCA by age 30 years, representing a frequent
cause of long-term disability. The absence of an approach to identify adults at risk for new or recurrent cerebral
infarcts is a major limitation in adult SCA care, as treatments for SCA continue to improve and lifespan is
increasing. The critical barrier to addressing stroke risk and prevention in adults rests with our inability to identify
underlying brain tissue-level impairment as a part of routine medical care and our need to develop new screening
tools to triage adults with SCA for appropriate stroke prevention therapies. The overall goal of this work is to
utilize recently identified biomarkers of inadequate cerebral hemodynamic compensatory mechanisms to test
fundamental hypotheses about stroke risk and treatment response in adults with SCA in a longitudinal study.
Over the past seven years, we have established a multidisciplinary team to systematically evaluate adults with
SCA, assessing known stroke risk factors in sequence with more novel pathophysiological indicators including:
(i) oxygen extraction fraction (OEF; ratio of oxygen consumed to oxygen delivered), (ii) cerebral blood flow (CBF;
rate of blood delivery to tissue), (iii) flow velocity, and (iv) cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR; ability of arterioles to
respond to a vasoactive challenge). This work led to the findings that (i) OEF is elevated in adults with SCA and
clinical impairment (prior stroke, intracranial stenosis, or monthly transfusions), (ii) OEF is elevated in adults with
SCA and evidence of new or progressive infarcts (retrospective data), and (iii) CBF response to treatment with
blood transfusion appears to be less robust in adults than children with SCA. We have developed methods to
measure these hypothesized stroke risk biomarkers using MRI approaches that do not require exogenous
contrast agents, making them a possible tool for SCI surveillance and for evaluating treatment response. Here,
we propose to extend this work to (Aim 1) a longitudinal, prospective study, to evaluate how metabolic and
hemodynamic stroke risk factors can be used to identify which adults with SCA will have new infarcts; (Aim 2) to
quantify the impact of stem cell transplant, an emerging curative treatment, on brain tissue health; and (Aim 3)
to compare OEF values obtained from the two most popular non-invasive MRI methods thereby informing their
collective or individual use in future multi-site clinical trials. The long-term goal is to identify underlying brain
tissue-level impairment that may provide evidence-based biomarkers to assess stroke risk, treatment response,
and guide therapy decisions in adults with SCA, with the goal of reducing stroke and cognitive dysfunction in this
high-risk population for which validated stroke screening tools do not exist."
10800751,"Applied Research section 2 – Project Summary
Following identification of associations between characteristics of a complex gut microbiota (GM) and
resistance or susceptibility to disease, investigators frequently attempt to evaluate the causality of those
associations by transferring the GM between resistant and susceptible animals. There are several ways to do
so including embryo transfer of GM recipients into pseudopregnant GM donors, cross-fostering of neonatal GM
recipients to nursing GM donors, simply co-housing animals, or experimentally administering a slurry prepared
from donor feces to germ-free or antibiotic-treated GM recipients (fecal microbiota transfer, FMT). Whether
successful or not in transferring the phenotype, few studies closely examine or report the efficiency of GM
transfer from donor to recipient, and very few studies directly compare more than one method of GM transfer.
Moreover, differences in the microbial diversity within donor and recipient GMs are known to influence the
success of GM transfer. Thus the long-term objectives of Applied Research section 2 (Specific Aim 1) are
to compare the efficiency of GM transfer using the aforementioned methods and well-controlled and thoroughly
characterized GM recipients and donors harboring low and high-diversity GM profiles. Specific Aim 1 is to test
the efficiency of GM transfer using embryo transfer, cross-fostering, co-housing, and FMT, in reciprocal
transfers between low-diversity GM donors and high-diversity recipients and vice versa, and to determine
whether the degree of GM transfer is associated with the degree to which the phenotype is also transferred.
Furthermore, while feces represents a non-invasive sample allowing for longitudinal sampling of individual
mice, it is well-recognized that feces reflects only the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Many physiological
processes and disease mechanisms are dependent on the GM present in the upper GIT, necessitating multiple
terminal cohorts of mice for longitudinal studies as non-invasive ante mortem sampling of the upper GIT is not
currently possible. With that in mind, the long-term objective of Applied Research section 2 (Specific Aim
2) is to develop and validate a system of non-invasively sampling the upper GIT for downstream sequencing
methods. Working with a team of biomaterials engineers, Specific Aim 2 to develop a polymeric/metallic
particle-based system capable of collecting bacterial cells selectively from the upper GIT following oral gavage,
and then being retrieved and isolated from feces for downstream molecular analyses. The development of
such a system would advance the three ‘R’s of comparative medicine by reducing the required number of mice
for longitudinal studies examining the upper GIT. Moreover, these methods would revolutionize human
medicine and would be imminently patentable and likely to lead to subsequent funding via multiple
mechanisms. Collectively, the Aims of Applied Research section 2 will significantly enhance the ability of
researchers from a wide range of fields to manipulate the GM of laboratory mice in an informed manner, and to
sample regions of the GIT that were previously inaccessible."

endpoint evaluations, development of methodology and computing tools for identification of
predictive genomic markers, and early-stage clinical trial design. From March 1, 2014 – August
31, 2017, the SDMC provided statistical, data management, and IT collaboration for 20
treatment trials currently in development, 21 treatment trials that opened to accrual and, 100
trials that opened prior to March 2014, for which patient follow-up or manuscript preparation is
in progress. SDMC members were authors on 234 published manuscripts reporting on Allianceled

reviews, editorials, or position papers on novel statistical and bioinformatics methods, analyses
and software, and provided substantial statistical support and leadership on 44 publications
which leverage individual patient data from multiple Alliance studies. SDMC systems are robust
and scalable and support all needs of the Alliance. The SDMC has implemented Medidata Rave
for all trials, consolidated to a single information systems infrastructure, met all NCI OEWG
timelines, collaborated on international trials, partnered on prospective and retrospective
registration trials, and is leading the ALCHEMIST trial, A151216 (part of the NCI precision

10797075,"Project Summary / Abstract
Research Plan: Targeted protein degradation using molecular glues - small molecules that bring a protein of
interest in proximity to an E3 ligase - emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, especially for
proteins that have been historically challenging to target with conventional drug discovery approaches. However,
the development of molecular glue degraders presents a formidable challenge due to the absence of a
systematic methodology for identifying these compounds. Currently, most molecular glue degraders employed
in the clinic setting have been identified through serendipitous discovery, thereby limiting their potential
applications for targeting intractable oncogenic proteins. To address this challenge, I have developed a novel
chemoproteomic approach, referred to as ""Lysate IP"", which enables the identification of novel molecular glue
activities in small molecules.
In my preliminary investigation using this method, I discovered that lenalidomide, an FDA-approved molecular
glue degrader, induces ASS1 recruitment to CRBN, but it does not result in ASS1 degradation. Given the
extensive use of lenalidomide in the clinic and in CRBN-based PROTACs, it is crucial to examine all potential
activities that lenalidomide elicits. Therefore, during the mentored K99 phase, I propose to investigate the
implication of ASS1 recruitment to CRBN by lenalidomide, and its role in lenalidomide resistance in multiple
myeloma (Aim 1). In the subsequent independent R00 phase, I intend to utilize the developed Lysate IP assay
for the large-scale, multiplexed identification of novel molecular glues against unexplored E3 ubiquitin ligases
(Aim 2), as part of the anticancer drug discovery process. The primary objective of this research is to
systematically identify and characterize new molecular glues with the ultimate goal of expanding the small
molecule toolbox for targeted cancer therapy.
Career Development Plan: I have created a 5-year career development plan that enables me to attain my goal
of becoming an independent investigator in cancer biology. My extensive background in chemical biology and
medicinal chemistry has positioned me in a unique position to accomplish the goals outlined in this proposal.
Supported by an interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators, including Drs. Benjamin Ebert, Eric Fischer,
Scott Armstrong, and Amit Choudhary, I aim to acquire novel proficiencies in a range of areas including large-
scale chemical screenings, mass spectrometry, omics-scale data analysis and visualization, and comprehensive
cancer biology. Additionally, with institutional support from the Broad Institute, as well as through formal
coursework and training, I will establish an independent, cancer-oriented drug discovery program with the goal
of expanding the range of druggable proteins using small molecules."
10786221,"Recent studies have reported widespread transcription of mammalian enhancers into noncoding RNAs in a
stimulus-dependent manner. Growing evidence shows that these RNAs, known as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs),
have essential roles in orchestrating higher-order chromatin interactions to facilitate gene expression and
phenotypic outcomes during development and disease. As a result, eRNAs are emerging as an important
component of the gene regulatory machinery. Due to their recent discovery, the expression, and roles of
eRNAs in vascular dementia are virtually unknown. Recently, we applied a combination of genome-wide RNA-
seq and genome-wide enhancer mapping using H3K27ac ChIP-seq to identify several ischemia-induced
eRNAs at multiple time-points of reperfusion in the mouse cerebral cortex. This was the first study on eRNAs in
brain vascular injury. We found an important role for one such eRNA in modulating post-stroke brain damage
and gene expression. In the current project, we will apply our expertise in eRNA discovery and function to
identify eRNAs that are expressed in the adult hippocampus specifically during the development of vascular
dementia. Using a standardized bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model of vascular dementia, we will
induce hippocampal hypoperfusion in the mouse brain across a 30-day time-window. In Aim 1, we will use an
unbiased, genome-wide approach incorporating H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to map active enhancer
elements and their respective eRNAs from the earliest stages of cerebral hypoperfusion (day-3 post-BCAS) to
the manifestation of vascular dementia (day-30 post-BCAS). In Aim 2, along the same timeline we will apply
the cutting-edge method of Hi-C to capture genome-wide higher order chromatin interactions to pinpoint
enhancer-to-gene promoter contacts and map their dynamics along the BCAS trajectory. Together, this work
will identify novel enhancers and eRNAs that are activated specifically in response to BCAS-induced
hypoperfusion in the hippocampus and generate a catalog of putative enhancer-gene relationships that may
encompass regulatory networks. These data will lay the foundation for future mechanistic and functional
studies investigating these regulatory networks and their impact on the development of the hippocampal
pathophysiology and vascular dementia."
10791873,"One in every nine babies in the US is born preterm. Speech, language and hearing disorders
(SLD) are among the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders in children, especially
among very preterm survivors. About 40% of very preterm infants (≤32 weeks gestational age)
develop speech-language disorders while 10% have permanent hearing loss, increasing the
impact on communication difficulties. Currently, it is not possible to accurately predict in the first
several years of life which children will develop speech-language disorders, and speech-
language therapy is the most delayed of any intervention provided to preterm infants. Such an
advance would facilitate early intervention and research therapies during critical windows of
optimal neuroplasticity. Our central hypothesis is that prediction of speech-language disorders is
possible by 3 m corrected age (CA) with combined innovative measures of structural and
functional brain connectivity with magnetic resonance imaging, evoked response measures of
speech processing, and novel, sensitized hearing measures. Primary aims are to (1) Identify
biomarkers of brain connectivity deficits in very preterm infants that predict SLD; (2) Identify
impaired speech processing and all degrees of hearing loss in very preterm infants; and (3)
Develop predictive models using advanced biomarkers in preterm infants for adverse speech,

10786495,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lyme disease (LD), the most prevalent tick-borne illness in the US (~300,000-475,000 annual cases), is
caused by spirochetes of Borreliella burgdorferi (Bb) sensu lato (s.l.) complex. When early LD diagnosis is
missed, it is left untreated and LD becomes chronic. Human vaccine is unavailable. Antimicrobial treatment of
chronic/persistent infection is often unrewarding. LD may last for years, presenting itself as skin lesions,
arthritis, carditis, and/or Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). Both central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems
(PNS) are affected, which results in headache, fatigue, memory loss, depression, facial nerve palsy among
others. The main reason for incomplete understanding of LNB is the limited availability of adequate animal
models. Nonhuman primates are the only model that demonstrates similarities to clinical manifestations of
human LNB. However, issues of cost, reagents availability, non-reproducible genetic backgrounds, and ethical
concerns limit their use. Laboratory mouse strains do not develop neurological clinical signs and encephalitis.
The current knowledge gap is the lack of suitable mouse models of LNB. The overall objective is to develop
mouse model that will be permissive to Bb entry into the CNS/PNS, develop inflammatory lesions in the neural
tissues, and exhibit neurological signs. In the preliminary 3-year-long study, the Collaborative Cross (CC)
resource (32 lines; ~240 mice) was extensively used to identify the mouse model of LNB. The data showed
that 100% of mice of CC line E, which were infected with Bb for 6 months, including the mouse that exhibited
neurological signs upon Bb infection, developed significant inflammatory lesions in the brain, spinal cord,
and/or peripheral nerves. In this application, it is proposed to test different neurotropic Bb strains using CC line
E whose mice showed Bb infection-induced inflammation in their neural tissues upon Bb infection. It is also
proposed to include new 18 CC lines that have not been tested, so that a total of 50 CC lines (32+18) will be
used to identify genetic factors contributing to LNB via quantitative trait locus anlaysis. The following Specific
Aims will be pursued: SA1: Determine if line E mice infected with different neurotropic strains of Bb s.l.
will produce distinct LNB phenotypes; SA2: Localize genetic factors contributing to LNB.
This approach is innovative as the CC resource has never been utilized in the LD research field. Identifying a
single CC line that consistently shows the presence of inflammation and/or spirochetes in the neural tissues
will be considered a substantial advance in the field of LNB. The mapping resolution is expected to identify
causal regions with confidence, and the number, effect sizes, and relationship among QTL identified will help
guide subsequent investigations and provide the foundation for a future R01 application. The proposed
research is significant because a mouse model of LNB will allow the scientific community to study the LNB
pathogenesis in much greater detail and and provide the foundation for a R01 applications."

scleroderma [systemic sclerosis (SSc)] and after stem cell transplant in graft-vs-host disease. SSc and the
sclerodermoid subtype of graft-vs-host disease (sGvHD) most commonly affect the skin and the degree of skin
involvement is associated with higher mortality and internal organ dysfunction2,3, suggesting common
underlying mechanisms. T cells are fundamental regulators of fibrosis pathogenesis in both diseases, but the
mechanisms by which T cells drive fibrosis remain unclear. Mismatch of minor histocompatibility (mHA) alleles
is required for the induction of sGvHD4, but the importance of antigen-independent T cell functions is poorly
understood. This proposal aims to understand how antigen non-related CD4+ T cells contribute to the
pathogenesis of SSc in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.
In this project, we examine how innate-like functions of CD4+ T lymphocytes regulate skin fibrosis. CD4+ T cells
respond to a specific antigen and differentiate into distinct subsets of helper T cells, including Th1, Th2, and
Th175. However, differentiated CD4+ T cells can respond to IL-1 family cytokines to generate a diverse
cytokine milieu, including IFNγ, IL-13 and IL-17A6. Such bystander activated CD4+ T cells have been shown to
drive autoimmunity in diseases such as multiple sclerosis7. SSc and sGvHD skin are characterized by aberrant
expression of cytokines spanning type 1, 2 and 17 immune responses8-10. We therefore propose that bystander
activation of CD4+ T cells occurs in SSc and sGvHD and to investigate the mechanisms by which it is
generated. To accomplish these goals, we will use sclerodermoid GvHD mouse models, which are the primary
models of SSc skin fibrosis dependent on adaptive immune cells4,11. In our first aim, we will characterize
bystander activation of CD4+ T cells in sGvHD mice by modulating the number of antigen unrelated CD4+ T
cells and measuring their accumulation and cytokine expression profile in relation to fibrosis severity. This will
allow us to establish to what degree bystander activated CD4+ T cells affects skin fibrosis in vivo. In the second
aim, we will examine the cytokine signals that activate CD4+ T cells in this model. We will assess protein levels
of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 family members in the skin and blood and perform in vitro validation
for their ability to drive expression of effector cytokines and extracellular matrix genes by fibroblasts. Together,
these aims will provide mechanistic insight into how T cells drive the pathogenesis of SSc skin fibrosis, which
may identify new targetable signaling pathways for development of treatments that impact patients’ lives."

The vertebrate eye lens is made up of concentrated, highly refractive proteins called crystallins, which enable it
to form images by focusing light on the retina. Most studies of crystallins focus on their ability to remain stable
and soluble for decades in the absence of protein turnover in the lens. Refractivity is equally important to crystallin
functionality, but is less well understood. This project seeks to elucidate how crystallins provide focusing power
both as individual proteins and as a network of intermolecular interactions in the crowded environment of the
lens. Our preliminary work has shown that amino acid composition alone does not determine crystallin refractiv-
ity: three-dimensional structure and interactions with water on the protein surface are also critical. We will build
on this work by measuring the refractive index increment for lens crystallins from humans and model organisms
and relating the results to spatial interactions among polarizable side-chain moieties. In particular, we propose
to investigate cataract-related and engineered crystallin variants in order to test hypotheses about how structure
impacts refractivity. We will measure refractivity first in concentrated solutions mimicking the crowded cellular
milieu, and then in whole lenses from model organisms in order to set the stage for future studies on human
lenses. This will enhance the current model of protein refractivity, which is mostly based on measurements in
dilute solution. On the level of the whole lens, we will develop novel methodologies to specifically visualize the
refractive index distribution in space. The long-term goal of this research is to bridge the gap between interactions
of light with individual crystallin molecules and the spatial arrangement of proteins that generates the refractive
index gradient of the vertebrate lens. In the future, the knowledge gained will provide insight into healthy lens
function and guide the design of improved artificial lens materials."

Systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome affect multiple organs of
the body. While the human body is naturally capable of self-healing, it faces an increasing
challenge as multiple components of the systems of the human body go awry. Metabolism is a
dynamic network of biochemical reactions that support cell proliferation and biosynthesis. On the
whole-body level, metabolic networks of individual tissues and organs are connected by the
circulatory system and interfaced with the digestive and excretory systems.
Our ability to cure systemic diseases relies on a quantitative understanding of whole-body
metabolism, which requires comprehensive measurement of its dynamic states. However,
challenges arise from the lack of our ability to quantify metabolic fluxes (i.e., rates at which
pathways are utilized) on a systems level. Metabolic fluxes are a direct readout for the dynamic
state of metabolism but intangible deduced quantities that result from the catalytic interaction
between metabolites and enzymes according to the kinetic and thermodynamic laws. Metabolic
flux analysis (MFA) framework allows quantitation of metabolic fluxes by imposing mass balances
on all isotopologues resulting from stable isotope tracing experiments. As carbons form the
molecular backbone, 13C-labeled substrates are extensively employed.
The overarching aim of this project is to facilitate the measurement of metabolic fluxes on
muti-tissue and whole-body levels by tracing multiple isotope tracers. Knowledge of
metabolic fluxes offers dual benefits of laying a solid foundation for understanding and controlling
metabolism. To effectively achieve this computationally intensive goal, our teams at UCLA and
Stevens will combine deep learning with analytical, stable isotope tracing, and simulation
techniques. Using multilayer neural networks, we will develop deep learning models that predict
metabolic fluxes from the isotope labeling patterns of metabolites. With the augmented flux
determination capability, we will impart quantitative systems-level knowledge of metabolism in
individual and across tissues in co-cultures and animals."
10790222,"Project Summary/Abstract
Newborn screening (NBS) is a successful public health initiative; newborns in every state are
screened for multiple genetic disorders. There are over 30 genetic disorders recommended for
NBS, many states screen for fewer due to resource restrictions. Cystic fibrosis (CF), an
autosomal recessive disorder with hundreds of known CF-causing mutations, is one of the more
prevalent disorders in NBS, and is included in every state’s NBS initiative. The gold standard
Sweat Chloride (SC) diagnostic test for CF is expensive and impractical as a screening test.
Therefore, all states use multi-tiered screening algorithms (i.e., processes) for CF NBS,
consisting of relatively inexpensive screening tests that are used on dried blood spots routinely
obtained from the newborns.
Most CF screening algorithms start with the low-cost, low-efficacy immunoreactive trypsinogen
(IRT) test, followed by a genetic test, where the latter searches for a subset of known CF-causing
mutations, and end with an SC test for confirmation. However, CF NBS algorithms, namely the
combination of specific tests and the decision rules used (e.g., IRT thresholds, number of testing
tiers, mutations to search for, when to send a newborn for an SC test), vary widely among the
states, leading to quite different rates of false screen negatives and false screen positives, and
testing costs. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a holistic framework for
designing optimal NBS algorithms that are accurate and equitable, using CF as a model disorder.
This framework will utilize prescriptive analytics, including optimization, risk prediction, and
data analytics, comprised of novel, data-driven models and methodologies, and will consider
novel testing methods, such as pooled genetic testing.
To accomplish our research goals, and validate and demonstrate our results, we will: (1) develop
models to optimize current screening algorithms; (2) develop novel screening algorithms for CF
utilizing pooled and multiplex genetic testing combining disorders; and (3) validate the modeling
framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness by designing an optimal CF NBS algorithm based
on data from the state of New York and validating the results via predictive analytics (via
sophisticated simulations and sensitivity analyses), and descriptive analytics. The models and
ideas developed in this research can be extended to other disorders. This research is in
collaboration between The University of Alabama and New York State Department of Health,
Wadsworth Center, and has the potential to change screening practices nationwide."

Recent work has begun to examine associations between perceived discrimination (PD) and later life cognitive
impairment. Both cross-sectional and short-term longitudinal (i.e., 2-6 year) studies suggest that general PD--
that is, PD not necessarily attributed to any specific reason such as race, gender, or beliefs--is related to worse
cognitive function in later life, particularly within the memory domain. However, there has been a lack of studies
with long-term follow-up periods focused on reported experiences of PD earlier in the life course, and few
studies of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). Studies have also lacked a means of
addressing potential bias due to selective survival. Finally, studies have yet to examine the potentially complex
interactions between multiple attributions for PD and subgroups. The present exploratory/developmental study
seeks to fill these gaps by examining associations between PD at age 29 and ADRD by age 76 in a subset of
the Project Talent cohort. Project Talent was a national probability sample of high school students in 1960, 25%
of whom were followed up at age 29 in the early to mid-1970s. The PT Freshman class, at age 29, received a
measure of PD similar to the contemporary measures of major lifetime discrimination. The cohort has since
been followed up in later life for chronic health conditions (from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services), including ADRD classification based on the ICD9/10 codes, and mortality f(rom the National Death
Index). After updating these data to reflect the most recent two years through age 76 for the sample, we will
investigate two aims. The first involves estimating the association between PD at age 29 and ADRD by age 76,
controlling for both standard confounders and selective survival. Our second aim utilizes recursive partitioning
to determine the potentially complex interactions between specific PD attributions and subgroups conferring
the greatest ADRD risk. Given the relative newness of this area of work and dearth of long-term follow-up
studies, we expect results to contribute significantly to the current understanding of the role of PD in ADRD."

 Approximately one-fifth of the United States (US) population lives in rural areas. Americans in rural
areas often experience poorer health and engage in fewer health promotion activities compared to their more
urban counterparts. Currently there are more healthcare clinicians per capita in urban areas compared to rural
areas in the US. Despite a greater need for healthcare in rural areas, the US experiences a paradox regarding
access to care in rural areas: Americans with the greatest need for healthcare experience the least access to
care. While this clinician maldistribution has been present for decades, relatively little is known about why
clinicians choose to locate in a specific area. Even more concerning is that the clinician maldistribution is
worsening over time, forcing millions of Americans to drive farther to obtain healthcare. The disparity in
access to care increases both morbidity, mortality, and increases health care costs.
 We propose to evaluate a theoretically-grounded, quantitative experimental approach to studying
reasons underlying the maldistribution in the US healthcare clinician workforce, and to identify potential
policy approaches to address these disparities. Specifically, we will evaluate the relative importance of job-,
community-, and personal-related attributes for medical residents and fellows as well as physician assistant
(PA) and nurse practitioner (NP) students using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE methodology is
a rigorous survey method used to elicit preferences, quantify tradeoffs, and understand decision-making. This
study is innovative because it will be the first to use DCE methods to identify policy options for increasing the
attractiveness of rural jobs in the US. Our proposed study will address three aims:
Aim 1 will elicit individual-, community-, and job-related preferences that influence decisions on whether to
choose a clinical position from residents and fellows, as well as PA and NP students.
Aim 2 will develop, pilot-test, and deliver the DCE survey to characterize the most important attributes and
their levels that influence whether to choose a particular clinical position.
Aim 3 will estimate the relative importance of the most important attributes and their levels that influence
whether a clinician chooses a particular clinical position.
 This proposed research will provide policy- and decision-makers with an important first step towards
designing policy options and incentives that increase the attractiveness of healthcare jobs in rural areas. More
broadly, this proposed research will also provide our research team pilot data from which to generate future
research with healthcare clinicians and identifying policy options and incentives to retain them in rural areas."
10790522,"Project Summary
The lung is a major target of infections and allergies. Dendritic cells (DCs) in the lung function as sensors of
the immune system that detect and process pathogens and allergens to activate T cell-dependent adaptive
immunity. In addition, pathogens and allergens often stimulate airway sensory neurons either directly or
indirectly, leading to primary defense response such as coughing and sneezing. Recent studies highlighted
the role of neurons in immune responses, but the interaction between these two sensor modules, DCs and
sensory neurons, in inflammation in the lung is incompletely understood.
Infection with helminth parasites is a major health burden worldwide. Some helminth species such as
roundworms and hookworms in humans and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), a commonly used model agent
to study hookworm infection in mice, traffic to the lung during their life cycle and cause potent type 2
inflammation. The larvae of these parasites stay in the lung only transiently before they get coughed up and
swallowed to migrate to the intestine, where they eventually mature and lay eggs. Thus, the cough-triggering
sensory neurons seem to play an important role in their life cycle, but their role in the regulation of inflammation
remains unclear.
We previously identified CD301b/Mgl2 as a marker for the migratory type 2 conventional DCs in peripheral
organs including the lung, and showed that CD301b+ DCs are required for the differentiation of Th2 cells. We
recently found that CD301b+ DCs are required for Nb-induced lung inflammation as well as for timely clearance
of the parasite. Interestingly, our data also suggest that CD301b+ DCs and sensory neurons suppress each
other to regulate lung inflammation during Nb infection.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that Nb parasites are sensed by CD301b+ DCs and sensory neurons,
which then mutually regulate each other to orchestrate type 2 inflammation in the lung. By using Nb infection
as a model, the long-term goal of this project is to understand how sensory neurons modulate type 2
inflammation in the lung. Since the lung is a major site not only for helminth infection but also for other type 2
inflammation disorders such as allergy, asthma and fibrosis, understanding the mechanism for the regulation of
type 2 inflammation is of clinical relevance."
10793522,"Neuromodulation is crucial for information processing throughout the brain. Neuromodulators influence neuronal function by acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to alter neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, which can then affect circuit functions. GPCRs are major drug targets used to treat a variety of diseases, including neurological disorders. The causal link between in vivo subcellular signaling mechanisms and behaviors is poorly understood due to the limited tools available to monitor signaling in freely behaving animals. Activation of GPCRs stimulates G-protein signaling to increase or decrease cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and bidirectionally control Protein Kinase A (PKA) and Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP (EPAC) signaling. Although GPCRs are diverse, the downstream second messenger systems are limited. Therefore, the overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that GPCRs decode incoming modulatory inputs by generating distinct spatiotemporal patterns of cAMP-mediated signaling to control basal ganglia circuit functions. To test this hypothesis, I propose two innovative specific aims: Specific Aim 1 – I will determine the spatiotemporal dynamics in real- time of A-kinase phosphorylation using virally expressed A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR) and cAMP using the EPAC Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET) - based sensors before and after the induction of striatal long- term depression (LTD) in specific cell types. To execute this Aim, I will use transgenic mice to target specific neuronal cell types and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to quantify FRET activity. These results will build on my previous published findings and will be of broad interest to the basal ganglia field. Specific Aim 2 – I will monitor cAMP and PKA temporal signaling profiles in specific striatal cell types in freely-moving mice during spontaneous locomotion and motor-skill learning on the accelerated rotarod using virally expressed AKAR and EPAC sensors and deep brain in vivo fiber photometry. This proposal will be the first to determine the cAMP mediated signaling dynamics in striatum during synaptic plasticity and learned behaviors. Throughout my career, I have been interested in determining the causal link between synaptic plasticity and behaviors. At every stage of my career, I have advanced in my technical abilities and refined my scientific experimental design. As I train with my mentors, Drs. Lovinger and Vogel, I will further expand my technical abilities and increase my scientific sophistication to ask impactful questions and design appropriate experiments to address these questions. Additionally, my mentors will train me to communicate my scientific findings effectively, run a successful lab, and mentor to students. I have recruited two extramural investigators, Drs. Cheer and Gremel to serve as advisory committee members and aid in my successful transition to an independent faculty position. Together, my mentors will ensure that I am trained in the skills required to attain a tenure-track faculty position and succeed as an independent research investigator."
10793524,"Summary:
Morphogenesis of vertebrate tissues and organs occurs through well-orchestrated tissue interactions. During
development of the upper jaw, signaling interactions among the forebrain, the facial ectoderm, and the
intervening neural crest cells regulate development of the upper jaw. Our research has revealed that signals
from the brain and the neural crest cells act together to induce expression of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) in the
Frontonasal Ectodermal Zone (FEZ), a signaling center located in the surface ectoderm of the Frontonasal
Process (FNP) that directs patterned growth of the upper jaw anlagen. Our preliminary data also suggest that
Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors are involved in inducing and maintaining the pattern
of SHH expression in the FEZ by an interacting genetic network. The research proposed in this application is
designed to uncover the gene regulatory mechanisms that are activated by signals from the forebrain and the
neural crest, as well as, to investigate the role of PBX transcription factors in regulating SHH expression in the
FEZ. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) SHH signaling from the forebrain induces “competence” in surface
ectoderm cells to express SHH; 2) subsequently, upon arrival, neural crest cells induce transcription of SHH in
competent cells of the FEZ, and 3) PBX transcription factors participate in regulating expression of SHH in the
FEZ. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims using avian and murine embryos. In each Aim, we will
use chick embryos because they allow us to manipulate the signaling interactions between the brain and the
FEZ (Aim 1), the neural crest cells and the ectoderm (Aim 2), or expression of PBX1 and PBX3 (Aim 3). We
will use a variety of genomic approaches (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, GRO-seq) to evaluate changes in chromatin
and activated transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs) at the SHH locus. In Aim 3, we will also assess
morphological, cellular, and molecular outcomes of altering PBX gene expression, and we will use mouse
embryos to take advantage of data already generated in the Selleri laboratory. The results of the work
proposed in this application will shed light on the molecular aspects of facial development, and will aid
understanding of disease processes that occur in this region. Allelic variants in SHH, or SHH pathway
members, are associated with human dysmorphologies of the craniofacial complex in diseases such as
Holoprosencephaly and cleft lip with our without cleft palate. Recently, PBX genes have been identified as risk
variants in patients with craniofacial dysmorphology. Hence, our innovative approach combining studies with a
solid foundation in developmental biology with chromatin analyses will yield information that is directly
applicable to understanding human dysmorphology."
10793629,"Challenges. Tumor spheroids (and organoids) have become an instrumental tool in cancer research. These
self-organized, three-dimensional (3D) systems can recapitulate phenotypic and functional traits of patient
tumors in vivo, thereby serving as a powerful testing bed to study tumor heterogeneity, interactions with the
environment (e.g., extracellular matrix), and responses to external stimuli (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation). Fully
harnessing spheroids' utility, however, is stymied by lack of high-throughput analysis methods. Conventional
bright-ﬁeld microscopy, although widely used to monitor spheroids in culture, fails to capture detailed cellular
organizations; advanced ﬂuorescent microscopy can resolve individual cells, but its imaging throughput is
restricted by the small ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) and the scanning mechanisms involved. Innovations. We aim to
advance a new volumetric imaging microscope (VIM) for single cell analyses in tumor spheroids. Speciﬁcally,
we will explore integrating Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) with diffraction tomography. FPM is based
on a spatially coded-illumination technique, collecting low resolution image sequences while changing the
position of a point-light source. These images are then numerically combined in the Fourier space, which
allows FPM to achieve both wide ﬁeld-of-view and high spatial resolution in 2D images. We reason that full 3D
microscopic images can be recovered by accounting for optical diffraction during the numerical reconstruction.
Approaches. Aim 1. System development. We will build a VIM system featuring: i) a new numerical algorithm
to reconstruct 3D volumetric images; ii) a new light-illumination strategy to speed up the data acquisition; iii)
microﬂuidic cartridges optimized for spheroid culture and drug treatment; and iv) multicolor imaging capacity for
molecular detection. The complete VIM will resolve individual cells constituting a spheroid at high resolution
(lateral, 0.4 µm; axial, 1 µm) in a large imaging volume. Aim 2. Treatment monitoring with tumor spheroids. We
will test VIM's practical utility: VIM-enabled spheroid imaging will reveal earlier than bulk imaging whether a
spheroid is responsive or resistance to drug treatment. To generate a tumor model, we will use primary GBM
cells from patients. GBM spheroids will be grown and treated with drug (temozolomide) inside microﬂuidic
cartridges. We will use the VIM to monitor how single cells change their phenotypes under treatment, and
correlate these changes with treatment outcomes. Impact. The VIM will be a transformative tool for cancer
research, empowering researchers with rich data sets and substantially advanced analytics. Immediate
applications include better monitoring of anticancer drug responses in 3D cell culture, analyzing cellular
heterogeneity, and prospectively detecting cellular fate under various physiological conditions. These
outcomes will strengthen the clinical and scientiﬁc utility of tumor spheroids in cancer research."

addition to research, trainees will attend research colloquia, graduate seminars, journal clubs, and a course in
Scientific Ethics and the Responsible Conduct of Research. It is expected that this experience will provide
trainees with both technical and problem solving skills that will inspire them to include vision research as one
important component of their future career as optometrists. In the most favorable scenario, highly motivated
trainees will choose to continue their research by entering the combined O.D.-M.S. or O.D.-Ph.D. graduate
programs in Vision Science and thereby obtain both a clinical and a research degree. The training will be
conducted within the 50,000 sq. ft. of state-of-the-art basic, translational, and clinical research space at the

available to the trainees. Trainees will consist of optometry students from any of the schools of optometry in
the US who have completed their first or second year of the professional program and have shown high
academic achievement. The Training Program strives to provide trainees the clinician/researcher interface that
is essential to bringing the latest scientific discoveries to the clinic. This experience is aimed at providing

of Servicemembers deployed to combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Resultant persistent
postconcussive symptoms (PCS), such as impairment of memory and concentration, irritability, mood
instability, sleep disturbances, and migraine headaches frequently have disabling personal, professional and
domestic consequences. In addition to these immediate consequences, repetitive mTBI may initiate processes
leading to neurodegeneration and dementia.
 This competitive renewal application proposes to continue longitudinally a currently funded VA RR&D
Merit Review: B77421, ""Mild TBI and Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration"". In the current funding period, we
have made substantial progress in 1) identifying objective structural and functional neuroimaging biomarkers
that characterize the clinical phenotype of blast-induced mTBI, 2) identifying objective impairment and
longitudinal decline in cognitive function in mTBI Veterans using our refined neuropsychological assessment
battery, and 3) identifying in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma a group mTBI-specific inter-related
neuroinflammatory chemoattractant, vascular disturbance, and neurodegeneration biomarkers. We have
integrated neuroimaging, cognitive, and biomarker findings into a consistent model of regional cerebellar-
thalamic-frontoparietal cortical and brainstem dysfunction in repetitive blast mTBI. Goals of this continuation
proposal are to determine whether cognitive performance is associated with neuroimaging and/or CSF and
plasma biomarkers of mTBI and/or genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative dementia, and to determine
whether neuroimaging and CSF and plasma biomarker abnormalities are transient, static, or progressive. We
also propose 1) a new plasma biomarker goal: central nervous system (CNS)-derived plasma exosomal cargo
proteins, 2) new clinical assessments of sleep: in-theater sleep history and sleep/activity monitoring via
Actigraphy, and 3) an additional advanced neuroimaging analyses: diffusion tensor imaging Automating-Fiber-
Tract Quantification.
Specific Aim 1: To continue characterizing longitudinally the clinical (neurocognitive, neurologic, behavioral)
and structural/functional neuroimaging characteristics of disrupted cerebellar-thalamic-frontoparietal cortical
and brainstem function in OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with repetitive blast trauma mTBI.
Specific Aim 2: To determine if OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with repetitive mTBI exhibit CSF and plasma
neurovascular, neuroinflammatory, and neurodegeneration biomarker changes associated with the onset and
progression of neurodegenerative dementing disorders.
Specific Aim 3: To determine the effects of genetic risk factors for neurodegeneration (apolipoprotein E
[APOE] polymorphisms and microtubule associated protein tau [MAPT] subhaplotypes) on clinical
characteristics and neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with repetitive mTBI.
 This proposal is in response to RFA RX-18-014: Studies on the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma and
focuses on the long-term consequences of repetitive mTBI. By identifying objective neuroimaging and CSF and
plasma biomarkers of blast mTBI and neurodegenerative dementias, the proposed research has potential for:
1) improving the accuracy of blast mTBI diagnoses; 2) identifying clinical characteristics and biomarkers of
blast mTBI that suggest potential treatments and provide the ability to track response to potential treatments;
and 3) identifying health care needs unique to blast mTBI Veterans. Successful completion of the proposed
research has a high likelihood of yielding both short-term and long-term clinical impacts. The project will yield
tools for objective biomarker diagnosis of mTBI and form the evidence base for rational design of clinical trials
to treat current symptoms of mTBI and to prevent progression to neurodegenerative dementing disorders."

10794232,"Lipid dysregulation of immune mediated intestinal epithelial healing
A single layer of epithelial cells protects us from harmful interactions with the intestinal microbiota and harmful
agents we inhale and ingest daily. Unresolved damage to this epithelial layer can lead to the development of
chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). High fat diets (HFD) correspond to
increased incidence and severity of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Diets high in fat have been
demonstrated to directly induce pro-inflammatory functions in macrophages, promoting chronic inflammation. In
the intestine, HFD has been shown to decrease barrier function and promote chronic inflammation. However,
it’s impact on intestinal immune function and tissue repair processes is less understood.
 Our immune system supports the proper functioning of tissue barriers. In response to tissue damage,
tissue macrophages induce pro-inflammatory immune functions aiding in protection from pathogens. In the
resolution phase of this response, these cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to dampen inflammation and
promote tissue repair. Perturbations to any aspect of this response can lead to ineffective repair of tissue injury
and development of inflammation. A key signal involved in this molecular switch of macrophages from pro- to
anti-inflammatory responses is clearance of apoptotic cells, specifically apoptotic neutrophils. Defects in this
response have been linked to many auto-immune and chronic inflammatory diseases including lupus, type 1
diabetes, atherosclerosis, COPD and cardiovascular disease. Tissue macrophages are important in intestinal
homeostasis and their dysfunction is thought to drive disease pathogenesis in IBD. Further, defective barrier
repair is seen in intestinal disease, but it is unclear whether defective apoptotic cell clearance by intestinal
macrophages is involved and what mechanisms could modulate this process.
 To determine the impact of HFD on intestinal tissue repair responses, we utilized short-term HFD feeding
in the context of mouse models of intestinal injury. Our data demonstrates that HFD increases susceptibility to
colitis with increased weightloss, aberrant epithelial cell proliferation, loss of goblet cells and tight junction
proteins necessary to prevent microbial penetration into the body. Further, we identified dysregulated immune
responses resulting in an inability of intestinal immune cells to properly support barrier function and repair. We
also find that HFD alters macrophage responses to and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils. Together, we find
that HFD feeding directly promotes altered functions of intestinal immune cells leading to barrier repair defects.
These findings led us to hypothesize that dietary lipids directly interfere with apoptotic cell recognition and uptake
receptors and activation of downstream pro-repair signaling pathways resulting in dysregulated intestinal barrier
repair. This is the basis of my K01 application."
10794355,"Despite the discovery of hundreds of genetic mutations associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental
comorbidities – including autism and intellectual disability (ID) – no effective treatments are currently available.
Our recent work has identified the primary common mechanisms across mutations at a large scale in astrocytes
and inhibitory neurons that express the GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) encoding SLC6A1. Preliminary findings
suggest 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a previously FDA-approved chaperone inducer for pediatric use, displays a
mechanism-based rescue in those mutations. Specifically, PBA appears to repair mildly misfolded proteins and
increase membrane expression of the wildtype allele across all tested mutations. Moreover, our success has
prompted a pilot trial with very promising results. This study aims to fully characterize the effect and detailed
mechanisms of PBA rescue. Our central hypothesis states that protein misfolding and impaired trafficking
are standard mechanisms for SLC6A1 mutations, which display rescue potential through
pharmacological intervention by restoring effective protein activity. As a part of our research, our lab has
developed highly relevant preclinical model systems, including a plasmid library of SLC6A1 mutations, mutation-
bearing patient cell lines, and knockin mouse models. Future studies focused on these model systems will
provide critical insights into disease mechanisms with high potential of translating the findings to treatment.
Moving forward, our lab aims to (1) evaluate the effect of PBA on restoring GAT-1 function in vitro for 20 patient
mutations, (2) gauge the effect of PBA on restoring GAT-1 function in vivo in Slc6a1 mutation knockin mice, and
(3) elucidate the underlying mechanism of PBA rescue on GAT-1 functioning to establish a foundation for novel
treatment approaches. Research design and methods. We will employ a plasmid library containing >50
SLC6A1 mutations identified from patients across a wide spectrum of disease phenotypes, two knockin mice,
and two lines of patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived neurons and astrocytes to determine the
impact of PBA on the mutant GAT-1 trafficking and function. We will utilize a multidisciplinary approach, including
in vivo microdialysis, to determine the dynamic interplay of GAT-1 inhibition, GABA levels, and seizures in
knockin mice. All patients carrying SLC6A1 mutations are heterozygous, which suggests there is benefit in either
boosting the remaining wildtype allele or rescuing the mutant copy or both. In either case, the overall GABA
uptake activity should be improved in patients. The large-scale study will provide us a broad view of the impact
of PBA. In contrast, the in-depth investigation of mice and patient-derived cells will provide critical insights into
PBA's rescue mechanism in partial and complete loss-of-function mutations. We propose to test this hypothesis
in vitro and in vivo with high-throughput assays and cutting-edge new techniques in iPSCs and mutation knockin
mice. Our goal is to identify a novel treatment target for genetic epilepsy using SLC6A1 as example. We believe
the impact of this study is broad as it can be scaled up for many genetic epilepsy syndromes and others."

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating psychiatric disorder that brings heavy burden to health care systems. A
large literature indicates that individuals with SZ show markers of early aging, such as faster decline in cognitive
functioning, increased risk for dementia, and significantly shorter life expectancies. Interestingly, the increased
rate of dementia in SZ cannot be fully accounted for by the established dementia risk factors or the pathology of
neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting additional pathological causes of cognitive impairment and increased
mortality in older SZ patients. Additionally, many SZ patients develop medical conditions such as diabetes,
metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, conditions often exacerbated by side effects of antipsychotic
medications. However, it is unclear whether these phenomena reflect premature aging early in life, accelerated
pace of aging later, toxic effects of chronic psychosis with antipsychotic therapy, or a mixture of all three. Recent
advances in the field of early psychosis including our own work suggest that an “immuno-oxidative” pathway,
including NMDA receptor hypofunction/glutamatergic dysfunction, bioenergetic impairment/redox dysregulation,
and neuroinflammation, form a “central hub” of brain pathology in SZ. These biochemical abnormalities result in
neuronal dysfunction that eventually might disrupt the long distance and large-scale neuronal communication,
thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction. To study these phenomena, we have developed novel neuroimaging
approaches to measure the redox ratio (NAD+/NADH) in vivo, as well as other markers of mitochondrial function,
including creatine kinase (CK)/ATPase activity and the antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—a molecule essential for
cellular repair that has functional ties to NAD. Research has shed some light on these mechanisms in early
phases of SZ and transition to chronic illness. However, little progress has been made in understanding their
role across the lifespan in SZ, despite the fact that these abnormalities are closely linked with the diverse early
aging phenomena seen in SZ. In this application, we propose to extend our previous research on the early stage
of SZ to older populations to examine the trajectory of biochemical abnormalities in SZ. Our overarching
hypothesis is that metabolic and redox abnormalities continue to unfold over the lifespan and are associated
with additional sequelae for impaired brain function in SZ. To capture the full aging trajectory, we propose an
accelerated longitudinal design where we recruit patients with SZ and age/sex-matched healthy controls (HC)
between the ages of 40-70. We will collect a broad neurochemical profile as described above, but also structural,
functional, and vascular neuroimaging, as well as comprehensive cognitive and clinical assessments. This rich
dataset will enable us to explore dynamic mental illness trajectories. It may provide targets for future interventions
to slow down abnormal aging, reduce risk of dementia, and delay mortality among people with SZ."

 The treatment paradigm for newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has largely
remained unchanged: a uniformly applied regimen of 6 cycles of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). A newer regimen for intermediate or high-risk patients replacing
vincristine with polatuzumab vedotin (R-pola-CHP) has recently shown improved efficacy. The randomized
FLYER study demonstrated that shortening frontline therapy for patients younger than 60 with limited-stage, low-
risk DLBCL from 6 cycles of R-CHOP to 4 cycles of R-CHOP followed by 2 cycles of rituximab alone is possible
with equal efficacy and decreased toxicity. However, eligibility for this approach is based on a pre-treatment risk
assessment applicable to a minority of patients. Stratifying a patient with advanced stage DLBCL as low risk by
their interim response could be a new way to identify patients for treatment de-escalation.
 Fragments of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) containing cancer-specific sequences can be isolated from
patient peripheral blood. Next generation sequencing-based assays that detect ctDNA have shown promise as
“liquid biopsies” in DLBCL, allowing for molecular response assessment and detection of minimal residual
disease (MRD). However, this technology has not yet been used in real-time. All studies on ctDNA in DLBCL
have been retrospective or non-interventional to this date, involving sequencing of archival samples without
clinical integration. Phased variant enrichment and detection sequencing (PhasED-seq), which involves the
detection of fragments of ctDNA harboring multiple somatic mutations, boasts the lowest limit of detection of
available techniques. In retrospective and prospective analyses, patients who were MRD negative by PhaED-
seq after 2-3 cycles of frontline DLBCL therapy experienced long term remissions in >90% of cases.
 Patients with advanced stage DLBCL that achieve interim MRD-negativity are likely overtreated with 6
full cycles of therapy, and a ctDNA-guided de-escalation approach could still lead to cure while sparing patients
from unnecessary toxicity and treatment. Demonstrating the feasibility of real-time ctDNA sequencing during
DLBCL therapy is needed before adopting said approach into routine clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is
it is feasible to perform interim ctDNA sequencing during standard frontline DLBCL therapy to determine which
patients should discontinue chemotherapy early. The proposed single-center pilot study will enroll 8 patients with
newly diagnosed, stage II-IV DLBCL intended for 6 cycles of R-CHOP or R-pola-CHP. Patients MRD-negative
by PhaED-seq after cycles 2 and 3 will de-escalate to rituximab alone for cycles 5-6, while all other patients will
receive 6 full cycles. We will investigate the following aims: 1. Determine the feasibility of ctDNA assessment in
real-time to guide decision making during frontline therapy for DLBCL, 2. Assess the outcomes of patients who
become undetectable for ctDNA during frontline therapy for DLBCL and discontinue chemotherapy early, and 3.
Evaluate the safety profile associated with a de-escalated course of frontline therapy for DLBCL."

Angioplasty and stenting for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) of the femoropopliteal artery (FPA) carries one
of the highest rates of reconstruction failure because the FPA experiences low blood flow and large
deformations during flexion of the limbs. Our results using perfused human cadaver models and PAD patients
demonstrate that these deformations are significantly more severe than assumed previously, and that none of
the existing PAD stents are able to adequately accommodate them, resulting in adverse stent-artery
interactions that contribute to treatment failure. Informed by the mechanical and structural characteristics of
human FPAs determined by studying >900 human arteries of different ages with different risk factors, and
utilizing knowledge gained from studying 12 different commercial PAD stents, we propose to focus the current
project on translating the results we obtained using human cadaver models to patients, and testing the
hypothesis that a new optimized stent design capable of withstanding the severe biomechanical environment
of the flexing limbs improves arterial healing. We will accomplish this through three Specific Aims.
 In Aim 1 we will validate cadaveric limb flexion-induced deformations using bent-limb patient CTAs at
baseline and at 9 and 18 months after stenting. These data will allow us to translate results previously obtained
using human cadavers to PAD patients, and to validate the ability of our computational models to predict
location and severity of restenosis as a function of patient, lesion, and stent characteristics. In Aim 2 we will
develop and manufacture optimized and generic stents for the FPA that would be able to accommodate limb
flexion induced deformations while maintaining low intramural stresses and optimal hemodynamics. These
stents will then be manufactured and evaluated in silico and in vitro in comparison with existing commercial
devices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will compare optimal, generic, and commercial stents in a preclinical swine model
of limb flexion, where performance of our optimized stent design will be compared to the generic design, and to
one of the most commonly used commercial stents (Zilver) implanted in the popliteal artery.
 Validation of cadaveric FPA deformations in live PAD patients, and design of an optimized lower
extremity stent may facilitate more durable reconstructions benefiting PAD patients with claudication and
critical limb ischemia. Our extensive knowledge of FPA biomechanics and mechanobiology combined with
deep understanding of commercial stent designs and computational models of limb flexion-induced
deformations, will ensure successful completion of the new Aims, and will promote cost-effective in silico
comparative effectiveness studies of current and future cardiovascular devices, helping advance the paradigm
of patient-specific modeling and personalized medicine."
10802337,"ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning
neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes
in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications
indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo
alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance
techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are
lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to
typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the
brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better
understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and
during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across
the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and
individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis-
related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison
data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY
over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances
in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our
understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision
medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a
substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis."
10802338,"Caspase-­3  activation  during  apoptosis  can  trigger  caspase-­3  cleavage  of  gasdermin  E  (GSDME).  The 
gasdermins  (GSDM)  are  a family of proteins,  whose  cleavage  activates  inflammatory death,  called pyroptosis. 
N-­terminal GSDM fragments form pores in the cell membrane that cause rapid cell death in which the cell swells,

to normal  tissue, and  mutated  in  some others.  GSDME  expression  suppresses  colony  formation  in gastric  and

resistance in melanoma and lung cancer cell lines. We hypothesize that GSDME acts like a tumor suppressor, 
that some tumor cells avoid pyroptosis by downregulating or mutating GSDME and that the switch from

chemotherapy  and  radiation.  In  preliminary  data,  cancer-­associated  GSDME  mutations  are  shown  to  be 
primarily  loss  of  function  mutations.  Gsdme  knockout  in  cancer  lines  promoted  tumor  growth  while  ectopic 
GSDME expression strongly inhibited tumor growth in immune competent mice. The tumor suppressive role of

T  cells  and  NK  cells.  Based  on  these  data,  we  hypothesize  that  GSDME  suppresses  tumor  growth  by 
recruiting  and  activating  anti-­tumor  killer  lymphocytes.  We  also  found  that  granzymes  B  and  M,  death-­
inducing proteases of killer lymphocytes, directly cleave GSDME during killer cell attack to activate pyroptosis in 
a  caspase-­independent  manner,  which  is  amplified  by  caspase  activation.  We  also  hypothesize  that  direct

 Psychiatric geneticists have discovered hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Brain expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can successfully explain some of those genetic associations. Differences in genetic
association between disparate ancestral populations are often reported, however, it is not known whether such
population differences originate from different underlying risk genes or from different allele frequencies and linkage
disequilibrium of the same risk genes. Our central hypothesis is that genetic regulation of gene expression
within brains, as represented by eQTL, can explain the disease GWAS signals. Population structure
influences eQTL as it influences GWAS. The major assumption is that the biological foundation of GWAS and
eQTL is the S-E-D relationship, short for SNP-Gene Expression-Disorder. Functional interpretation of GWAS signals
relies on the discovery of S-E-D relationships. Due to a lack of brain transcriptome data from populations of non-
European descent, interpreting SCZ GWAS results for variants uncommon in other populations presents a
significant challenge. To discover the causes of these population differences, we will develop a transcriptome
dataset of a new brain collection from East Asians (EA, N = 578) combined with samples from the existing
PsychENCODE project (EA, N = 18). We will also use data of individuals of African ancestry (AFR, N = 411) from
the PsychENCODE projects. Along with data from those of European descent (EU), which dominates the
PsychENCODE (N =1,321) projects, we will have brain transcription data of three major populations in the world.
Our specific aims include: 1) to relate SNPs to gene expression (the S-E portion of the S-E-D networks), we will
develop and compare eQTL and coexpression networks of postmortem brains from three populations, EA, AFR and
EU; 2) to connect SNP-expression to SCZ GWAS signals (the S-E-D aspect), we will use brain eQTL data to
explain SCZ GWAS of EA, EU and AFR populations and to identify SCZ risk loci that also serve as regulators of
brain gene expression; 3) to develop a novel cross-population predixcan algorithm that can infer genetically
regulated gene expression, and identify those differentially expressed in patients. The algorithm will be used
to re-analyze existing PGC SCZ data, and use Vanderbilt University data to replicate the findings. This study will
improve the understanding of the genetic contribution of population diversity to SCZ risk. It is critical for developing
more precise diagnoses and treatments for the benefit of diverse populations, for addressing health disparity."

The gut-lung axis is one of many communication axes between the gut microbiome and extra-intestinal
systems, organs, and tissues. This axis has been shown to strongly influence lung immune and inflammatory
responses, primarily in allergic asthma inflammation and lung infections. The mechanisms for this
communication are speculated to be immune cell reprogramming and/or direct translocation of factors,
including microbial ligands. This project focuses on the latter mechanism, namely the direct effects of gut
microbiome products that make their way into circulation, on lung tissue. The goals of this proposal are to
rigorously investigate 1) the gut-lung axis with a focus on metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
and commensal-associated molecular patterns (CAMPs), 2) the lung cells that integrate these gut-derived
signals, and 3) the effects of these signals of the responsiveness of the lungs to sterile and infectious injury.
Based on our preliminary data, we propose that SCFAs and CAMPs are released by the gut microbiota and
travel to the lung where they affect the immunometabolic programming of resident immune and non-immune
cells, such as alveolar macrophages (AM) and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. In Aim One, we will perform
metabolomics analysis of stool and lung tissue as well as intervening tissue and vascular beds. This aim will
also assess the role of SCFA-producing microbiota in establishing the lung’s baseline metabolite profile and
track the migration of specific CAMPs from the gut to the lung. In Aim Two, we will focus on identifying the lung
cells that are capable of sensing both CAMPs and metabolites and how they contribute to the lung adopting a
primed “ready” state or an unprimed “unready” state vis-à-vis infection and injury. Furthermore, the effect of
these CAMPs and metabolites on the metabolic program of the lung in general and the specific lung cells will
be examined. In Aim Three, we will explore ways to manipulate the gut-lung axis through antibiotic use, diet,
focused metabolite delivery, and through microbiome transfer or restoration. These studies will attempt to
establish conditions whereby microbiome-based therapies may help restore healthy lung immune
responsiveness. In summary, this project seeks to understand the role of the gut microbiome and dietary
metabolites in maintaining healthy lung immunity. Overall, we anticipate that these studies will help
fundamentally increase our knowledge of the direct acting effects of the gut microbiome on lung immune
responses and in doing so provide valuable insights towards designing future novel therapeutic options that
take advantage of the gut-lung immune axis."

Deciphering the mechanisms controlling cell fate choice and maintenance in the brain is a critical step in
understanding devastating neurological disorders such as microcephaly, schizophrenia and brain cancer that
result from defects in these processes. An unresolved question is how the mammalian neuronal identity is
maintained and protected, particularly at the transcriptional level, during development and adult life. The
BTB/POZ and Zinc finger transcription factor RP58 (aka ZBTB18), is required for brain development and
neuronal differentiation both in vivo and in vitro; Mutations in RP58 are linked to human microcephaly and corpus
callosum agenesis. We have analyzed the embryonic cortical post mitotic neurons’ transcriptome and showed
that the expression of gene markers of other cell lineages, such as myogenic lineage, is increased following
Rp58 deletion suggesting that RP58 protects the neuronal identity by repressing genes of other lineages. Our
overall hypothesis is that RP58 is required to establish and maintain the neuronal identity and that the loss of its
transcriptional function may lead to microcephaly and to neurodegenerative diseases in the adult brain. To
decipher how RP58 controls cell differentiation in the brain and to identify RP58 protein partners that may be
involved in its function, we have performed RP58 immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry (IP-MS)
experiments on mouse embryonic and postnatal cortices. Our data show that RP58 binds to members of both
the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the SWI/SNF complex, two critical chromatin remodeling
complexes involved in brain development. In addition, using quantitative histone proteomics and western blot
analyses, we show that deletion of Rp58 in the embryonic brain leads to global changes in histones post-
translational modifications (PTMs) including to decreased H3K27 methylation (H3K27me) and increased
H3K9/14 acetylation. These results raise the hypothesis that RP58 controls the identity of developing and adult
neurons and thus their transcriptional program by modulating the PRC2 and SWI/SNF complexes function and
the chromatin landscape.
The following aims will address these hypotheses. Aim 1: Decipher how RP58 and chromatin remodeling
complexes interact to establish and maintain neuronal identity. Aim 2: Decipher if and how RP58 is required for
histone PTMs in neural cells. Aim 3: Determine the cell and developmental stage-specific RP58 protein-protein
interacting network in neural cells. This grant is a collaboration between the Dahmane lab (Weill Cornell
Medicine) with expertise in developmental neurobiology and mouse genetics and the Garcia lab (University of
Pennsylvania) with expertise in quantitative mass spectrometry as it relates to epigenetic mechanisms and
chromatin regulation. Completion of these proposed studies will lead to the elucidation of the cell type and stage
specific RP58 regulatory mechanisms controlling neuronal identity and to key insights into the genetic and
epigenetic regulation of brain growth and of their misregulation in brain disorders such as microcephaly."

Parental acceptance after youth come out as LGBTQ is a protective factor for the health of this youth group;
however, parents lack support in initiating and sustaining sexuality discussions inclusive of their teens’
attractions, behaviors and identities. Thus, in the absence of skills and supports, adolescents’ and parents’
mental health, health behaviors and overall family functioning tend to be negatively impacted after cisgender
sons come out as gay, bisexual and queer (GBQ). The overall objective of this application is to test the
efficacy of Parents ASSIST (Advancing Supportive and Sexuality Inclusive Sex Talks), a sexuality
communication intervention for parents, after youth disclose GBQ identities. We will conduct a randomized
controlled trial with parent and GBQ youth dyads (N=476) to establish the efficacy of Parents ASSIST as a
hybrid 5-session online intervention that educates parents about germane LGBTQ-topics and provide
communication skills for inclusive family discussions. Our Specific Aims are to (1) determine whether Parents
ASSIST enhances parent-adolescent sexuality communication quality (e.g. parent- and child-reported comfort)
and quantity (e.g. frequency and range of topics discussed) compared to the control group, (2) establish
whether Parents ASSIST results in decreases in mental health symptomology (e.g. depressive and anxiety
symptoms) among parents and GBQ youth, increases dyadic health behavior (e.g. accessing preventive health
services, health screening behaviors), and improves family functioning (e.g. affective response,
communication, general functioning) over 12 months of follow-up, and (3) examine how theory-based variables
(e.g. attitudes and norms, self-efficacy and intentions to discuss sexuality with GBQ child) mediate the
intervention effects on adolescent and parent mental health, parent-adolescent health behavior and family
functioning over time. This proposal is innovative because it is one of few studies that investigate the role of
parent-adolescent sexuality communication with GBQ youth, it examines both individual and dyadic health
outcomes, and the study will include analyses on the differential effects that racial/ethnic factors may play on
GBQ youth and parents’ health outcomes to break new ground in addressing longstanding health disparities.
Ultimately, fortifying the capacity of parents to initiate and broach sexuality-sensitive communication with GBQ
sons offers new opportunities for families to be protective of all sexual and gender minority youth."

Project Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this project is to advance our nation's ability to protect public health in the
event of a large-scale, radiation/nuclear event by developing a single mobile point of care (POC)
diagnostic device that will fill three identified gaps in our country's current radiation triage
assessment capabilities. First, it will distinguish the worried-well from individuals exposed to
radiation doses at a threshold of 2Gy; second, it will provide an assessment of hematopoietic
acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) severity risk, as well as a radiation dose estimate beyond
2Gy; and third, it will allow the detection and quantification of soluble (Specific Aim 1, SA1) and
cell-surface associated (Specific Aim 2, SA2) blood- and organ-specific radiation damage
biomarkers to provide critical information about major organ and physiological system
damage/failure. The thrust of this proposal will be on developing and demonstrating the ability to
detect radiation damage biomarkers on an innovative handheld device. The device is comprised
of a well-vetted POC blood cell analyzer capable of performing a 5-part leukocyte differential
analysis in field-settings using an innovative lensless microscopy technology. The device
utilizes a fingerstick of whole blood and provides results in under 8 minutes. Here, we will
further expand these capabilities to allow for the immunoassay-based analysis of blood/plasma
radiation damage biomarkers. We initially will demonstrate the ability to detect and quantify
three soluble biomarkers of radiation damage in human blood samples; serum amyloid-A,
salivary α-amylase, and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, representing markers of
inflammation, salivary gland damage, and bone marrow progenitor cell distribution, respectively;
thereby demonstrating the utility of the system for multiple systems damage assessment. Our
immunoassay for soluble biomarkers will use a highly sensitive microsphere-complex formation
format that also allows for multiplex capabilities. In addition, we will demonstrate the ability to
detect a number of cell surface specific radiation damage biomarkers on our device. Lastly, we
will integrate into the device two biodosimetry-specific algorithms to allow the conversion of
blood cell enumeration data into indicators of radiation injury, dose exposure, and a prediction of
the risk of development of H-ARS (Specific Aim 3, SA3). By providing a single portable
diagnostic device capable of addressing many of the gaps that have been identified by NIAID in
our country's ability to respond to severe radiation incidents we will significantly advance
radiation triage public health responsiveness, as well as provide for the potential to revolutionize
POC immunodiagnostics."

The goal of the proposed K99/R00 award is to support Dr. Jennifer Velloza’s development into an independent
HIV and mental health researcher, with a focus on improving delivery of mental health interventions integrated
with HIV prevention services for young women. Dr. Velloza is an epidemiologist and postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Washington. This proposal outlines a 5-year training and research plan to build her capacity with
formal training in human-centered design and implementation science. Training Plan: To ensure transition to
independence, Dr. Velloza has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors with expertise in
human-centered design, implementation science, and PrEP and mental health service delivery for South African
adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). They have crafted a robust training plan with meetings and relevant
coursework. The training goals for the K99 are to: 1) Gain proficiency in human-centered design for intervention
adaptation; 2) Apply implementation science tools to identify implementation strategies for integrating a mental
health intervention in PrEP delivery; and 3) Transition to independence by leading a trial to test and optimize a
mental health intervention for South African AGYW in PrEP settings. These goals build on her prior experience
and training and support her long-term career goals. Research Plan: African AGYW face high rates of HIV and
common mental disorders. PrEP is a highly effective HIV prevention approach which is being scaled up in South
Africa. However, symptoms of common mental disorders are significant barriers to PrEP use and the South
African Department of Health is placing increasing emphasis on layered approaches to PrEP delivery for AGYW.
Effective mental health treatment, such as problem-solving therapy (PST), has the potential to be integrated with
PrEP delivery to address mental health challenges and modifiable barriers to PrEP use and improve PrEP
adherence for AGYW. The Friendship Bench is a promising evidence-based PST intervention option for AGYW
in PrEP settings given that it was developed for delivery in busy HIV clinics, is currently being scaled-up in South
Africa, and preliminary data suggests it can be adapted to improve HIV treatment adherence among African
women. Research is needed to adapt intervention content, evaluate effectiveness on mental health and PrEP
adherence outcomes, and identify implementation strategies for AGYW in PrEP delivery settings. The overall
goal of this proposal is to adapt, test, and optimize the Friendship Bench for African AGYW in PrEP delivery.
The Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify content for a mental health intervention and barriers to implementation in
PrEP clinics; 2) Design and pilot Youth Friendship Bench SA content and implementation strategies; 3) Conduct
a hybrid Type II trial to assess preliminary effectiveness of Youth Friendship Bench SA on PrEP adherence while
optimizing implementation for cost constraints in PrEP delivery; and 4) Identify themes around intervention
experiences. These aims correspond with Dr. Velloza’s training goals and she will emerge as an independent
scientist contributing to high priority issues around mental health and HIV prevention service delivery."

called uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). UCP1 ‘uncouples’ the mitochondrial proton gradient from ATP production,
thus avidly consuming glucose and fatty acids with the result being net energy expenditure. Active brown fat is
present in adult humans and its amount is significantly correlated with reduced body fat and circulating
triglycerides, greater insulin sensitivity, and lowered incidence of Type II diabetes. Increasing brown adipocyte
amount and activity could reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disease.
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-derived catecholamine norepinephrine, which act through β-adrenergic
receptors and cAMP, is a well-established activator of BAT and the recruitment of UCP1-positive cells in white
adipose tissue (WAT) depots (a process termed ‘browning’ or ‘beiging’). We have shown in prior work that the
cardiac hormones atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) also stimulate a similar
‘browning’ program in mouse and human adipocytes, and protect against obesity-associated insulin resistance,
hepatic steatosis and inflammation. This suggests that increasing NP signaling in adipose tissues is metabolically
beneficial. NP activation of NP receptor A (NPRA) leads to cGMP production, while the NP ‘clearance receptor’
NPRC removes NPs from circulation, and the ratio of NPRA to NPRC determines NP signaling capacity. Clinical
studies show that compared to lean individuals, obese individuals have lower circulating NP level, increased
NPRC level in adipose tissue, and blunted lipolytic responses to NPs. We observed similar patterns of receptor
expression and physiological responses in mice. It has been postulated that higher adipose NPRC levels
increases NP clearance, thus reducing NP availability in the circulation and efficacy in target tissues, resulting
in a so-called ‘natriuretic handicap’. On the other hand, conditions such as fasting and cold temperature exposure
reduce the level of NPRC expression, resulting in an increased NPRA/NPRC ratio and thus NP/cGMP signaling.
Our studies with mouse models further support these observations. We also find that the expression of other
components of the NP signaling system, such as phosphodiesterase-9 and the peptidase neprilysin are also
decreased in response to cold and βAR agonists The overall objective of this project is to: define the
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the Nprc, Pde9 and Mme genes in human and mouse adipocytes;
determine whether increased levels of NPRC in obesity serves as a ‘sink’ to remove NPs from circulation, thus
creating the ‘natriuretic handicap’, and test the effects of selective NP ligands to modulate insulin sensitivity."

 The goal of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award application is to
provide the candidate with advanced skills needed to establish an independent research program investigating
the pathogenesis and therapeutics of monogenic high myopia (HM) and inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs).
 Our overall hypothesis is that increased TGFβ signaling drives HM progression and structural changes
in the posterior segment indicative of pathological myopia (PM) in Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Rbp3-mediated
retinitis pigmentosa (RP). To test this hypothesis, the specific aims are to: 1) Determine the extent that Smad2/3
activation contributes to myopia progression, PM changes and retinal degeneration in MFS and Rbp3-/- mice; 2)
Define a role for TGFβ-dependent MAPK activation in myopia progression, PM changes and retinal degeneration
in MFS and Rbp3-/- mice. This is based on an extensive review of the literature and our high-quality preliminary
data demonstrating that: 1) MFS mice have significantly greater axial length (AL) and -9D myopic shift compared
to WT littermates; 2) MFS mouse eyes show increased Smad2/3 and MAPK (Erk1/2, Jnk1/2, p38) activation in
the ciliary body and retina; 3) AL and myopic shift are reduced in MFS mice after Erk inhibition; 4) Smad3-/- mice
display shorter AL and a prominent hyperopic shift compared to WT littermates. These data indicate that TGFβ
downstream pathways represent novel therapeutic targets for myopia and/or PM in MFS. Prior studies illustrated
that loss-of-function mutations in RBP3 cause autosomal recessive RP with HM (-12 to -17D) in humans, while
Rbp3-/- mice show markedly increased AL and myopic shift, as well as in-vivo and ex-vivo evidence of progressive
retinal degeneration. This offers an opportunity to evaluate a role for TGFβ signaling in this etiologically-distinct
form of monogenic myopia, with the goal of identifying and targeting common drivers of disease progression.
 The candidate is proposing a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework, meetings,
seminars and workshops overseen by his diverse, experienced mentorship team. His specific training goals
include to: 1) Refine his knowledge of in-vivo phenotyping of myopia and PM in mice, encompassing mouse eye
biometry, autorefraction, fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT); 2) Develop skills in in-
vivo phenotyping of IRDs and their complications in mice, including ERG, OCT, and optomotor response (OMR);
3) Enhance his skills in ex-vivo histopathological and biochemical analysis of mouse myopia and IRD models,
including PM changes (e.g. retinal detachment, retinoschisis, posterior staphyloma) and retinal degeneration
(e.g. retinal thinning, photoreceptor loss); 4) Acquire management skills to build a successful independent
laboratory; 5) Develop leadership skills in collaborative research; 6) Refine his communication and writing skills
to successfully apply for R01 funding; 7) Continue training in responsible conduct of research. His training plan
will be executed in coordination with the research activities described above. Results from this proposal will be
used to develop a future R01 research plan that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to independent research."
10798161,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ) and precocious ossification of cranial synchondroses are just two
examples of defects caused by disruptions to cranial joints. Proper form and function of joints are required for
connectivity and flexibility of the vertebrate skeleton. While the cranium has a vast number and subtype of joints,
most joint biology studies have focused on the limbs, leaving a gap in our understanding of how the cranial joints,
which are unique in their cranial neural crest cell contribution, develop. Our lab has recently generated single -
cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data for cranial neural crest-derived cells across 7 timepoints
(embryo to adult) in zebrafish. I have been able to extract preliminary global information about the transcription
factors and cis-regulatory elements, or enhancers, which separate cranial joints from other types of skeletal
tissues. While prior models have proposed joint cartilage is simply immature cartilage, my preliminary data shows
several enhancers drive expression in only cranial joints. Additionally, other enhancers drive expression in only
replacement cartilage. These data suggest the existence of two completely separate populations, with joints
being specified distinctly from replacement cartilage. In this proposal, I use the powerful genetics of the zebrafish
model to investigate what enhancers and transcription factors differentiate cranial joints from replacement
cartilage. My preliminary bioinformatic analyses suggest that Ap-1 transcription factors (Jun/Fos) work with the
master cartilage transcription factor Sox9 to generally specify joint cartilage. Interestingly, mutations in several
transcription factors can independently cause defects to only specific cranial joints, suggesting localized
transcription factors may specialize joints. The aims outlined in this proposal investigate the neural crest-derived
cells in developing cranial joints (Aim 1), how they are uniquely patterned separately from replacement cartilage
(Aim 2), and how region-specific transcription factors are responsible for specializing cranial joints in different
parts of the head and face (Aim 3). I plan to utilize techniques such as snATAC-seq and CUT&Tag to determine
if enhancers are uniquely opened or activated in joints. By combining these large datasets with transgenic assays
to confirm if transcription factor motifs are necessary and sufficient for joint activity and identity, I will significantly
enhance our understanding of cranial joint development. This project and activity plan for fellowship period are
designed to lay the groundwork for my long-term goal of obtaining a position as a tenure-track Professor at a
top-tier academic research institution. Furthermore, the data generated in this project will prepare me to generate
a competitive K99 application. I will receive mentorship from Dr. Gage Crump, a leading scientist in zebrafish
craniofacial development. The experiments in this proposal will take place on the Health Sciences Campus of
the University of Southern California, which hosts one of the most experienced communities of craniofacial and
skeletal biologists in the country."

is a Career Development Award (CDA) – 2 resubmission to the Veterans Affairs (VA) Rehabilitation Research
and Development (RR&D) Service (RFA RX-20-006). The candidate, Dr. Duc M. Ha, MD, MAS, is a Staff
Pulmonologist at the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center (RMR VAMC) and Assistant Professor at
the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU AMC). Dr. Ha has completed a master’s degree in
clinical research, postdoctoral research in pulmonary exercise physiology and patient-reported outcomes, and
published first-authorship, original research articles on the health impairments of Veteran lung cancer survivors
following curative intent therapy. Dr. Ha’s career development goals are to acquire in-depth training in 1)
qualitative research, 2) behavioral health science, and 3) the design and conduct of clinical trials focused on
rehabilitation and exercise. His longer-term goals are to evaluate rehabilitation services to improve the lives of
Veteran lung cancer survivors as a VA physician investigator.
Dr. Ha’s primary mentor, Dr. Robert L. Keith, MD, is Professor of Medicine and Cancer Biology at CU AMC
and Associate Chief of Staff for Research at RMR VAMC. Dr. Keith is a national leader in lung cancer with a
proven track record of research funding and mentoring. Dr. Ha’s co-mentors (and their relevant expertise) are
Drs. David B. Bekelman, MD, MPH, Associate Professor of Medicine (qualitative research, supportive care),
Jamie L. Studts, PhD, Professor of Medical Oncology (behavioral health science, lung cancer survivorship),
and Jennifer E. Stevens-Lapsley, PT, PhD, Professor of Physical Therapy (rehabilitation science). The
environment is collaborative with a long history of faculty development. This includes the RMR Geriatric
Research, Education and Clinical Center; Center of Innovation for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care;
Lung Precision Oncology Program; and the University of Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.
Lung cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S. Veterans – over 8,200 incident
cases are diagnosed each year. Approximately 50% of lung cancers are diagnosed at stage I-III and therefore
eligible for curative intent therapy. Survival rates among Veterans with early stage lung cancer have increased
along with advances in surgical and radiation techniques. Following curative intent therapy, many Veterans
experience physical function loss and increased symptom burden. Consequently, approaches are needed to
improve their function and quality of life (QoL). We hypothesize that telerehabilitation could mitigate these
adverse effects. Therefore, we seek to: (Aim 1) Conduct a qualitative study to assess (a) Veteran lung cancer
survivors’ health goals following curative intent therapy, (b) knowledge of outcome expectations for exercise
and rehabilitation, and (c) perceived self-efficacy and impediments towards technology. Participants (N=30)
will undergo semi-structured interviews guided by the Social Cognitive Theory. Qualitative data analysis will be
guided by thematic analysis. Results will be used to guide telerehabilitation programming. (Aim 2) Conduct a
pilot randomized study to examine the (a) feasibility, (b) acceptability, and (c) explore the effects of a
telerehabilitation intervention with these patients. Participants (N=40) will be randomized (1:1) to receive 12
weeks of telerehabilitation (experimental arm) or assessment only (control arm). Feasibility will be assessed by
enrollment, adherence, and retention; acceptability by System Usability Scales; and exploratory effects by
linear mixed effects models comparing changes in function, symptom control, and QoL between groups.
This CDA-2 project will inform strategies to tailor telerehabilitation and provide pilot data and training for an
early career physician investigator to establish independence, with a goal of a large-scale randomized trial (VA
Merit) of an optimized telerehabilitation program to improve the physical and psychosocial function,
independence, and QoL of Veteran lung cancer survivors following curative intent therapy."
10798251,"Project Summary
Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Poor understanding of the interactions
between tumor cells, especially cancer stem cells (CSCs), and normal brain tissues have played a role. Due to
the difficulties of obtaining tumor tissues, there is a limited availability of biologically accurate and matched in
vitro (tumor organoid) and in vivo (PDOX) model systems. Normal brain tissue is more difficult to obtain, making
it nearly impossible to develop normal brain organoids. To overcome these barriers, we propose to utilize our
existing (n=127) and future established patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models as the source supply
of tumor cells to develop matching tumor organoids. These PDOX models replicate the biology of original patient
tumors and represent a wide spectrum of the newly discovered molecular subtypes of malignant brain tumors.
Using 24 PDOX models, we have established 13 (54.1%) tumor organoids. Recognizing the rarity of normal
brain tissues, we propose to use autopsied tissues. Indeed, we have cryopreserved viable cells of normal
cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and sub-ventricular zone cells from children of different ages and showed
that the autopsied cerebral cells can proliferate in vitro to form neurospheres. We, therefore, hypothesize that 1)
autopsied normal brain tissues and PDOX models can provide critically needed and biologically accurate cells
for the development of normal and tumor organoid, and 2) the growth of these organoid are dependent on the
growth factor milieu of their location and modulated by the dynamic interactions between different types of cells.
Radiation therapy is one of the most important treatment regimens for pediatric brain tumors. Since mutation of
histone modification genes are frequent in pediatric brain tumors, our 3rd hypothesis is that such epigenetic
changes affect responses and resistance toward radiation, and successful targeting in organoid and PDOX
tumors will lead to new combination therapies. We propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Develop normal brain
organoids from autopsied normal cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem and subventricle zone from all age groups
and establish tumoral organoids from PDOX models and identify their location- and developmental-stage
dependent niche factor combinations, respectively. Aim 2: Understand the dynamic interactions between tumor
(CSCs and non-stem tumor) cells and normal brain cells. We will use co-culture assays to identify the niche
factor combinations that dictate cellular diversity and survival of CSC and normal brain cells, and perform global
multi-omics analysis and single cell RNAseq to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, followed by in vivo
validation of our findings in PDOX models. Aim 3: Determine the role of histone methylation in regulating CSC
survival and self-renewal of malignant brain tumors when perturbed by radiation. We will use normal and tumoral
organoids to determine how pre-existing histone methylation status affect their survival and to identify key
radiation-resistant methylation(s) by combining radiation with an informer set of small-molecule probes that
selectively target distinct nodes in tumor epigenetic regulatory circuity in organoids and in PDOX models."

 As malaria transmission declines, an increasing proportion of infections persist in the body at low levels.
Low-density malaria infection (LMI) are often chronic and represent a high proportion of infections among
children in the community and children presenting with fever, but they have been largely ignored because
standard point-of-care diagnostics have limited sensitivity to detect them, and they are considered incidental or
beneficial in that they may provide protective immunity again future malaria illness. However, much of this data
comes for high transmission settings and results are mixed. Also data from lower transmission settings
suggests negative health consequences. There is a growing body evidence to suggest that LMI are associated
with recurrent malaria, chronic anemia, poor growth, co-infection with invasive bacterial disease, and cognitive
impairment. Data from trials of intermittent preventative therapy (IPT) and mass drug administration (MDA)
also suggest benefits of treating LMI. However, these presumptive treatment strategies can also promote drug
resistance and are not practical in low transmission settings. More sensitive detection methods including
molecular approaches are increasingly available, but evidence of their effectiveness to reduce disease burden
is lacking. To inform policy and practice, there is an urgent need for evidence on the impact and safety of
detecting and treating LMI in children. The objective of the proposed project is to determine the long-term
health and socioeconomic effects of detecting and treating LMI in children. We hypothesize that compared to a
standard of care where malaria detection is passive and based on standard diagnostics (PCD), detecting and
treating LMI through use molecular detection methods in active case detection (ACDm) and passive case
detection (PCDm) in children will improve all-cause morbidity and have cognitive and socioeconomic benefits.
To test this hypothesis, we propose to conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial in children 6 months
to 10 years of age at an established trial site in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, where transmission is low and we have
found that a high proportion of infections are low-density. The effects of treating Plasmodium falciparum LMI
through active or passive case detection may differ. As such, we will study these as separate interventions and
compare each to the standard of care. A population representative sample of 600 children total will be recruited
(n=200 per arm, inclusive of 15% loss to follow-up) enabling at least 85% power (two-sided a=0.05) to detect a
20% effect size for each of the interventions compared to control. Children will be randomized into one of three
study arms: 1) standard of care PCD (Control) whereby children presenting with fever will receive artemether
lumefantrine (AL) based on positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) result, 2) ACDm (Arm 2) whereby children will
receive testing for malaria (using RDT and qPCR) three times annually, with AL administered for RDT or
qPCR-positivity, and 3) PCDm (Arm 3), in which children, when they have fever, will receive testing for malaria
(using RDT and qPCR) with AL administered for RDT or qPCR-positivity. Standard PCD will be conducted in
Arm 2 and no ACD will be conducted in Arm 3. To capture subacute or chronic effects, follow-up will occur over
2 years. Specific aims are: (1) To assess the impact of standard PCD plus ACDm vs standard PCD
alone on long-term child health. We hypothesize that adding ACDm will lower incidence of all-cause sick
visits. Secondary outcomes include anemia, growth, safety, malaria, antibiotic use, clinical symptoms, fever
episodes, clinical failure after fever episodes, immune responses, cognition, and socioeconomic effects. (2) To
assess the impact of PCDm vs standard PCD on long-term child health. We hypothesize that PCDm vs
standard PCD will lower incidence of all-cause sick visits. Secondary outcomes are as described in Aim 1. (3)
To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ACDm and PCDm. To inform potential scalability of the interventions,
we will use socioeconomic cost data from Aims 1 and 2 to compare each intervention to control and calculate
outcomes including: cost per sick visit averted, per disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and per economic
dollar saved. Our approach to address the challenge of LMI from the perspective of all-cause morbidity and
socioeconomic effects is innovative as the status quo has been to consider them for their relevance to malaria-
specific outcomes and transmission; we will also utilize innovative new tools to assess cognitive evaluation and
long-term socioeconomic impact. The significance of our study lies in the increasing worldwide relevance of
LMI and its associated morbidity for children; the importance of child health for global health, society, and the
economy; and the potential for this first trial of its kind to lead to policy and practice changes."
10798189,"Many current recommendations for dietary intake (DI) and physical activity (PA) to maintain optimal health and
minimize risks for chronic health conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are based on statistical
analyses of data prone to measurement error, including those collected from self-reported questionnaires and
wearable devices. Self-reported measures based on food frequency questionnaires are often used in DI
assessments, however, they are prone to recall bias. Wearable devices enable the continuous monitoring of
PA but generate complex functional data with poorly characterized systematic errors. Our work and that of
others established that failure to account for measurement errors associated with scalar-valued covariates can
lead to severely biased estimates, the impacts of function-valued covariates prone to complex heteroscedastic
errors or mixtures of error-prone functional and scalar covariates are not well understood. Most work on
functional data views the data as smooth, latent curves obtained at discrete time intervals with some random
noise that is often regarded as a random process with mean zero and constant variance. By viewing this noise
as homoscedastic and independent, potential serial correlations are ignored. However, our preliminary studies
indicate that failure to account for these serial correlations in error-prone function-valued covariates can severely
bias estimations. Additionally, while classification methods of PA patterns using device-based PA data have
been proposed, there is limited work to correct for heteroscedastic measurement errors when classifying error-
prone function-valued covariates, such as device-based PA data. With the increased availability of complex,
massive high-dimensional function- and scalar-valued biomedical data, the need to correct for measurement
error biases within these datasets to permit their accurate evaluation in various regression settings is critical.
This project will address these current data limitations by developing novel statistical methods that correct for
the complex mixtures of measurement errors associated with device-based PA and self-reported measures of
DI applied to obesity and T2D research. Our primary objective is to investigate health outcome-related complex
covariate relationships in various U.S. subpopulations by designing and applying statistical models that correct
for error-prone DI and PA data biases. Aim 1: Identify latent groups of PA patterns based on device-based
functional curves prone to heteroscedastic measurement errors and determine the association between
identified PA patterns and T2D status, adjusting for PA biomarkers, age, sex, and race. Aim 2: Assess impacts
of measurement error in DI and PA data on the quantile functions of FMI and BMI, adjusting T2D status, age,
race, and sex. Aim 3: Construct generalized functional linear regression models with error-prone function- and
scalar-valued covariates to evaluate the influence of PA and DI on T2D status. This project will overcome current
analytic barriers to accurately evaluating the effects of DI and PA on obesity-related health outcomes."

A decrease in muscle mass and function, known as sarcopenia, is highly prevalent in cancer patients and often
leads to decreased endurance, increased fatigue, falls, poor quality of life (QOL) and increased mortality.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the 2nd most common cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in men
worldwide, greatly impacting survival and QOL in these patients. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the
standard treatment for advanced and metastatic PCa. Unfortunately, ADT exacerbates sarcopenia contributing
to the symptom burden and poor overall QOL. Despite its relevance, there are no approved pharmacological
treatments for sarcopenia. Several gaps in our knowledge impede the development of therapies for sarcopenia:
1) There is no agreement on the specific tools to assess clinically relevant outcomes, 2) The underlying
mechanisms are not fully understood, 3) the lived experiences of these men have not been ascertained, and 4)
we are currently unable to predict who will develop sarcopenia upon starting ADT. The Overall Goals of this
proposal are to establish clinical outcomes and predictors of sarcopenia in PCa patients undergoing ADT, and
to characterize pathways and mechanisms leading to this phenotype, including the role of mitochondria. We
propose to perform a clinical trial including 70 men with a diagnosis of PCa starting ADT. Participants will be
followed for 12 months. Changes in body composition, muscle strength, physical performance, and patient
reported outcomes (PROs) including fatigue and QOL will be measured, and their clinical relevance ascertained.
Blood samples and muscle biopsies will be obtained at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to investigate genes,
proteins, and metabolites altered by ADT and to establish the predictive value of these biomarkers on clinical
outcomes of sarcopenia using a comprehensive multi-omics approach. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish
the clinical relevance of different outcome measures to assess sarcopenia in PCa patients starting ADT. We
hypothesize that ADT will cause clinically meaningful decreases in appendicular lean body mass (aLBM), muscle
strength, physical performance and QOL, 2) Identify and prioritize the molecular pathways mediating the effects
of ADT on these outcomes using a multi-omics approach. Our hypothesis is that ADT will alter gene expression,
protein and metabolite levels in muscle and plasma as measured by a comprehensive multi-omics approach,
and this will be associated with sarcopenia, 3) Determine the role of baseline biomarker levels as predictors of
sarcopenia; 4) Perform mechanistic studies in muscle tissue to define the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in
ADT-induced sarcopenia. We anticipate that specific pathways probed in plasma and muscle, and impairments
in mitochondrial function at baseline will predict the development of sarcopenia upon starting ADT. We will also
characterize the experience of these men with regard to impact on QOL. The data generated will provide
essential knowledge on informative tools to measure clinically relevant outcomes in ADT-induced sarcopenia,
and identify novel targets and clinically meaningful predictive biomarkers for this morbid condition."
10796216,"Invasive malignant melanoma has risen in incidence for decades. Dermoscopy aids in detection of the earliest
and most curable stage of melanoma. The long lead times required for appointments with specialists trained in
dermoscopy and a lack of dermoscopy training for mid-level practitioners, often the first to encounter a
melanoma, contribute to a delay in melanoma detection at the most curable stage. Recent advances in
classifier architectures and computing power have enabled development of advanced image-processing tools
to improve diagnostic accuracy, exceeding that of dermatologists. Extensive collections of dermoscopy images
are available to enable better training for deep learning computational techniques. However, automated
methods still need to provide sufficient accuracy for reliable melanoma screening for in-person and virtual
consultations. Computational techniques are less successful for limited data sets, such as those of specific
features. Our hypothesis is: Annotation of critical skin lesion structures for small-scale data sets by multiple
experts enables automatic structure detection that can improve automatic lesion discrimination ability.
 To investigate this hypothesis, the proposed three-year project is a collaboration with the largest
publicly available skin lesion image archive to create a platform that promotes international participation in
dataset annotation, curation, and validation to facilitate advances in skin lesion analysis research. This platform
will allow global experts to annotate and validate dermoscopic skin lesion image datasets to identify and
segment critical structures, providing an archive integrated into the publicly accessible International Skin
Imaging Collaborative (ISIC) image collection. Skin lesion feature analysis and validation studies will be
conducted to identify critical features contributing to improved melanoma discrimination from benign mimics.
The proposed research will investigate the fusion of existing deep learning techniques based on the entire skin
lesion with deep learning techniques trained using localized annotation information for guided deep learning of
specific skin lesion structures for feature extraction and diagnosis. We will perform statistical analyses to
determine relevant annotated skin lesion small-scale feature set sizes and the significance of feature detection
and diagnostic rates between standard deep learning techniques, targeted localized feature set-based guided
deep learning training, and fused (combined) results for hypothesis assessment. Hypothesis-driven feature
detection and diagnosis results from this study will impact small-scale dataset analysis for deep learning
algorithm development. As part of the proposed project, seminars will be provided to pre-college students
through STEM programs such as Project Lead the Way. Further educational and training opportunities will be
provided to undergraduate students pursuing pre-med, biological sciences, data sciences, and biomedical
engineering programs through seminars, summer camps, and hands-on mentored research opportunities."
10799565,"Pregestational diabetes induces neural tube defects (NTDs) in the offspring. Even under the best prenatal
care, diabetic women are still three- to four-times more likely to have a child with birth defects than nondiabetic women. Diabetes-induced NTDs are significant public health problems for both the mother and her child. Yet, the molecular mechanism underlying the teratogenicity of maternal diabetes is still unclear. We recently discovered a microRNA-mediated stress pathway in maternal diabetes-induced autophagy impairment leading to NTDs. Prolonged unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress play critical roles in maternal diabetes-induced NTDs. The molecular link between prolonged UPR and autophagy impairment is elusive. We found that silencing the major UPR sensor, IRE1α, triggered de novo autophagosome formation, and deleting the Ire1a gene in the developing neuroepithelium rescued autophagy thereby preventing NTD in diabetic pregnancy. Therefore, we hypothesize that maternal diabetes triggers IRE1α activation through ASK1 and the ASK1-IRE1α signal inhibits autophagy in the developing neuroepithelium through IRE1α RNase activity by producing XBP1s and degrading miR-17, which targets Txnip. XBP1s, the miR-17-Txnip circuit, and their crosstalk mediate the teratogenicity of maternal diabetes leading to NTD formation. To test our hypothesis, we proposed three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine whether ASK1-activated IRE1α is responsible for autophagy impairment in diabetic embryopathy. We hypothesize that maternal diabetes-induced ASK1 activation triggers IRE1α activation via direct phosphorylation and suppresses ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of unfolded proteins. We further posit that the ASK1-IRE1α signal suppresses autophagy leading to NTD formation. Aim 2 will investigate the potential crosstalk between XBP1s and miR-17, and their roles in maternal diabetes-induced autophagy impairment and NTD formation. We hypothesize that IRE1α cleaves XBP1 mRNA to form XBP1s and represses miR-17 expression, collectively resulting in altered ATG expression, and that XBP1s and miR-17 are reciprocally regulated, leading to autophagy impairment in the developing neuroepithelium and NTDs in diabetic pregnancy. Aim 3 will determine whether Txnip is a target gene of the IRE1α-miR-17 pathway and participates in autophagy inhibition in diabetic embryopathy. Our hypothesis is that Txnip, a downstream effector of the IRE1α-miR-17 pathway, represses autophagy by binding to and thus disabling the ability of ATG4 in processing LC3-I in to LC3-II, an essential step for autophagosome formation, leading to cellular imbalance and NTDs in diabetic pregnancy."

Exposure to the ambient air pollutant ozone (O3) is associated with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality,
rendering it an important public health issue. Controlled exposure studies show that acute O3 exposure causes
airway inflammation, epithelial injury, and a transient decrease in lung function. These studies have also
demonstrated that subjects exhibit highly reproducible differences in O3 response, suggestive of gene-by-
environment interactions (GxE). Candidate gene studies have provided evidence of GxE for a handful of genes,
however, the role of genetic variants in the rest of the genome is largely unknown. This data gap limits our ability
to identify susceptible individuals and gain insight into mechanisms by which O3 causes adverse effects. Here,
we put forth a proposal to address this data gap using human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs) in vitro. hBECs
are the first cells of the respiratory tract to interact with O3, and we have shown that hBECs exposed to O3 in vitro
upregulate the expression of key pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., CXCL8), mirroring the in vivo response. We
hypothesize that variation in O3-induced inflammation is associated with differences in hBEC gene expression,
and that inter-individual differences in gene expression at baseline and after O3 have a genetic basis, i.e., are
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Further, we hypothesize that some eQTL are caused by single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect chromatin accessibility (caQTL). In Aim 1, we will establish well-
differentiated hBEC cultures, grown at air-liquid interface, from 300 banked lung tissue donors of both sexes and
diverse ancestries, then expose them to O3 vs. filtered air (FA) and measure key hBEC O3 response phenotypes
(e.g. IL-8 production, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, barrier function, and cytotoxicity). We will profile gene
expression in FA and O3-exposed hBECs using both bulk RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq to identify O3-
induced/repressed genes and their cell-type specificity. After genotyping, we will map eQTL at baseline
(mRNAFA), response eQTL (mRNAO3-mRNAFA), and QTL for all hBEC O3 response phenotypes, then use
mediation analyses to identify SNPs and genes fitting a putative causal model: O3+SNP → [mRNA] → hBEC O3
response phenotype. In Aim 2, we will perform ATAC-seq to characterize how O3 alters chromatin accessibility
in hBECs, then map baseline and response caQTL. We will perform multi-omic data integration (eQTL, caQTL,
QTL) to identify gene regulatory models of O3 response, i.e., O3+SNP→chromatin accessibility→[mRNA]→hBEC
O3 response phenotype. Finally, in Aim 3, we will validate novel genes and gene regulatory mechanisms
underlying variation in O3 response in vitro and in vivo. We will determine how key SNPs affect gene regulation
and whether knocking down the corresponding genes alters O3 response in vitro. For in vivo validation, we will
test for association between SNPs of interest and O3-induced neutrophil recruitment in a dataset of 191 human
volunteers exposed to O3. In total, our work will identify genetic variants and gene regulatory mechanisms that
influence susceptibility to O3-induced airway inflammation."

Despite the accelerating expansion of online resources for modern life science education and training, the reality
is that development of molecular biology laboratory-based skills requires `hands-on' instruction, preferably in a
research-oriented context. Keeping pace with recent scientific breakthroughs and incorporating such
developments into the educational setting is challenging from both workforce and economic perspectives. Yet,
educational strategies that rely on traditional, lecture alone or outdated, laboratory experiences ineffectively
prepare the current and future generations of the US biomedical workforce. Here, we propose to develop and
implement a new paradigm for teaching modular molecular biology-oriented laboratory courses that relate
established critical skills to cutting-edge technologies in support of the professional viability of modern biologists
and biotechnologists. Our overarching goal is to initiate and support a collaborative effort to `teach the teachers'
how to Designate, Design, Develop, Deploy and Disseminate (5-D) Molecular Biotechnology Laboratory
Education Modules (MBLEMs) on cutting-edge topics across the higher education landscape. This aim will be
accomplished by fostering multi-institution cooperation, creative new pedagogical approaches, and integration
of interdisciplinary research and bioethics into novel educational modules. We will collaborate initially with teams
of participants from five different institutions, and then add three new partners along the way, that collectively
represent a broad range of higher educational missions. In support of the MBLEM effort, we will establish a
virtual support network, i.e., ongoing inter-institution communication throughout the year to enable MBLEM
implementation, led by faculty and teaching postdoctoral fellows at North Carolina State University (NC State).
The year-long, 5-D support process will be centered around an annual summer workshop at NC State attended
by representatives of our partner institutions that will nucleate interdisciplinary teams of faculty, teaching
assistants (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and experienced MBLEM instructors. As part of this
process, we will organize career development and outreach opportunities that bring together faculty and students
from the partner institutions, including those that focus on serving minority students and students with disabilities,
to form a supportive and inclusive community fostering modern life science laboratory training. We will also
assess MBLEM dissemination and the impact of training on participating MBLEM institutions educational
programs and students. Assessment will enable the identification of challenges faced at different institutions and
reveal how to better train diverse groups of students in critical skills needed to be productive members of the US
biomedical workforce."

The aim of this proposal is to hold an annual, full-week course in advanced gene mapping at The
Rockefeller University in New York. The course is directed towards advanced researchers who are familiar
with the fundamental aspects of statistical genetics but who need to become more proficient in the analysis
of complex traits. Thirty-four students will be accepted to each course, and stipends, to cover travel costs,
will be provided to ten participants who are either pre-doctoral students or post-doctoral fellows. The course
consists of two components: lectures on important current topics in gene mapping, as well as hands-on
exercises to be performed with the latest freeware software programs using cloud computing. The current
emphasis of the course is analyses of sequence and other omics data. The next Advanced Gene Mapping
course will be held January 27-31, 2020. The PI and five additional instructors who are experts in their
respective fields will teach on a variety of topics that include: data quality control; qualitative and quantitative
trait (population and family-based data) association analysis of whole-genome data (genotype, sequence,
and imputed); controlling for population admixture and substructure; meta-analysis; sample size estimation
and power calculations; detecting gene x gene interactions; analysis of epigenomic and RNAseq data;
elucidating pleiotropy; functional prediction and variant annotation; estimation of polygenic risk scores;
Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis; and fine mapping. A variety of freely available software
including ANNOVAR, GCTA-MLMA, PAINTOR, LDpred, PrediXCan, R, SEQSpark, and VAT will be
implemented to perform practical exercises. Since gene mapping is a quickly changing field, the topics and
analytic programs will be updated annually to reflect the latest developments in the field of statistical
genetics. Given the vast amounts of generated genetic data, it is essential to train researchers and give
them the necessary information and tools for data analysis to elucidate the etiology of complex traits."

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US, and many challenges still remain to discover novel and
more effective approaches to cure this devastating disease, which requires strong effort in translating basic
science knowledge into clinics. To accomplish this goal and further promote translational cancer research, it is
imperative to establish a sustainable program to train and educate the next generation of scientists and
clinicians, who must have broad knowledge and the ability to communicate and work with colleagues in both
fields. The goal of the Translational Oncology Training program (TOTP) is to ensure that the next
generation of cancer researchers are equipped with the tools and knowledge that will enable them to
bring bench-top discoveries into clinical trials and vice versa. The fellows and students in this program
will receive unique training in four different but highly integrated themes: Preclinical Modeling (PCM); Cancer
Image Guidance (CIG); Cancer Bio-Validation (CBV); and Clinical Translation (CLT). PCM focuses on analysis
of pathways and signaling involved in tumor progression using various preclinical models in order to identify
potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. CIG provides training in state of the art image-guided diagnostic
approaches and nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. Trainees in CBV will learn up-to-date
bioinformatics skills in multi-omics setting in order to study and analyze large cohort patient database.
Preceptors in CLT have ample experiences in clinical trials and they provide guidance on how to translate
basic knowledge into clinical trials. Trainees will rotate through three out of four themes during the first year
while taking didactic lectures from all four themes. They will also assemble a mentoring team consisting of both
Ph.D and MD faculty. The majority of preceptors of this T32 program are in the Hematology/Oncology and
Cancer Biology departments. This structure merges strong clinical and basic science entities in the Wake
Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). However, this training program is multidisciplinary
and in all, preceptors come from 11 different departments. The program is unique with many innovative training
tools: (i) highly integrated 4 translational themes that include both didactic lectures and hands-on rotations
among the themes; (ii) inclusion of both Ph.D postdocs and MD fellows to promote both bench-to-bedside and
bedside-to-benchtop translational cancer research; (iii) an individualized mentor team consisting of both Ph.D
and MD faculty; (iv) boot camp for clinical trial preparation for trainees (v) support from Disease Oriented
Teams (DOTs) from WFBCCC; (vi) Transition to Independence (TTI) program to support trainees to become
independent through preparation for K-type applications; and (vii) Broad-base career opportunities and
development plans such as Ph.D/MBA for graduate students. Therefore, through this training program, Ph.D
fellows/students will learn how they can bring basic science knowledge into bedside, while MD fellows will have
a deeper understanding of translational, hypothesis-driven research."

This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award aims to support
the career development of Dr. Hiu-fai Fong, a child abuse pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and
Harvard Medical School, in becoming an independent investigator whose work improves mental health care
and outcomes for families affected by child abuse. Dr. Fong proposes to develop and pilot test a novel
engagement intervention for Black and Latinx caregivers of sexually abused children to address the significant
burden of unmet mental health need for these children. Engagement interventions, in which child-serving
professionals (e.g., social workers) work with caregivers to increase children’s receipt of MH services,
represent a promising approach to address unmet mental health need but have not been well studied with
Black and Latinx caregivers of sexually abused children. This K23 project seeks to develop a novel
engagement intervention for this new population of caregivers that integrates components from two evidence-
based interventions (McKay’s engagement intervention and the DECIDE intervention). The research will use
principles of community based participatory research and a systematic process of cultural adaptation to
develop the engagement intervention over three Aims. Aim 1 will use in-depth interviews with Black and Latinx
caregivers of sexually abused children to identify sociocultural perceptions about child sexual abuse and
mental health care seeking. Aim 2 will use focus groups to elicit feedback from social workers that serve Black
and Latinx caregivers of sexually abused children and input from a community advisory board to culturally and
contextually adapt intervention components. Aim 3 will pilot test the new engagement intervention for feasibility
and acceptability with Black and Latinx caregivers of sexually abused children. This research will lead to the
development of a new engagement intervention ready for large-scale testing as a strategy to reduce racial and
ethnic disparities in mental health care after sexual abuse. Dr. Fong has assembled a highly experienced
mentorship team, including Dr. Margarita Alegria (intervention development for multicultural populations), Dr.
Megan Bair-Merritt (trauma-focused research), and Dr. Michael Lindsey (treatment engagement for minority
families) to guide her through a rigorous training plan to gain expertise in: 1) intervention development for
culturally diverse populations; 2) sociocultural and ethical issues in trauma-focused research with minority
groups; and 3) clinical trial methodology for behavioral interventions. Dr. Fong will leverage the unique
resources available at Boston Children’s Hospital (a leading pediatric healthcare and research institution, and a
specialty referral center for child sexual abuse) and the broader Harvard community (Harvard Medical School,
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Catalyst) to carry out her research and career
development plan. The K23 award will prepare Dr. Fong to tackle the substantial challenges of inadequate and
inequitable mental health care for abused children and their families as a future independent researcher."
10798801,"Abstract
Persistent racial/ethnic disparities in mortality in the U.S. create racial/ethnic disparities in young people’s
exposure to death in their families. Such differential exposure to family member deaths in childhood and
adolescence is a significant public and population health issue given the intense disruption of this family
experience, the physical and mental toll of bereavement, and the cascading life course risks of adverse early
life trauma. This project advances a significant interdisciplinary research agenda with an innovative conceptual
model that integrates sociological, biosocial, and psychological perspectives on human development and an
innovative mixed-methods design that combines quantitative analyses of an extant national sample with
quantitative and qualitative analyses of a local lab-based sample. Specifically, building on the PIs’ past
research illuminating the critical role of disrupted young adult transitions in lifelong sequelae of early exposure
to family member deaths, this project will document the links between exposure to family member deaths in the
early life course and unstable and insecure trajectories of socioeconomic attainment and family-building in
young adulthood; elucidate the physiological, cognitive, psychological, and social mechanisms (e.g., emotional
dysregulation, maladaptive learning, physical wear and tear, psychological scarring, counterproductive coping
behaviors) underlying these life course linkages; and identify concrete sources of resilience (e.g., opportunities
to achieve and connect) that allow young people facing such risks to have more stable transitions into
adulthood. These aims will be pursued by applying longitudinal modeling techniques and tools for promoting
causal inference to nationally representative data following adolescents’ transitions into adulthood from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. That national component will be supplemented by a
local component—its feasibility already validated by a pilot—involving new data from 480 young adults
participating in a laboratory-based cognitive and affective assessments, biosignal tracking, daily diaries,
surveys, and qualitative interviews. Following a sequential mixed methods explanatory design that will result in
a comprehensive visual map of integrated results and insights, analyses of these diverse sources of data will
iteratively inform each other to refine theoretical understanding of the issue and to identify the key mechanisms
that can be targeted for intervention, critical points at which to intervene, and potential social and institutional
supports for resilience leverageable for intervention. Led by senior sociologists with complementary expertise
and track records of NIH-funded translational mixed-methods research, this project will produce protocols,
data, and recommendations that advance theory and facilitate the use of evidence for action around a set of
issues that speak to a contemporary public health crisis. Doing so will galvanize attention to mortality and its
reverberating consequences and to a social justice movement that underscores racial/ethnic inequalities."
10797276,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer survivors with overweight or obesity (ow/ob) display increased morbidity and mortality even after
amelioration of disease. Improvements in dietary and physical activity patterns can mitigate this risk and can be
supported through comprehensive, multiple health behavior change (MHBC) interventions. Yet, translation of
MHBC interventions to clinical practice is limited, in part because traditional “treatment package” approaches are
not optimized for real-world implementation. Integration of multi-omic data can capture lifestyle exposures and
biological responses, providing the potential to strengthen conclusions and overcome limitations of existing
assessment methods. This approach could elucidate the biological underpinnings of how changes in modifiable
behaviors influence individual phenotype during survivorship. Such knowledge would help to identify and tailor
interventions for incorporation into survivorship care. Yet, this has not been conducted, posing a critical research
gap. My goal is to create a sustainable and scalable MHBC program combining diet and exercise to support
survivors with ow/ob and improve health in survivorship. Thus, the overall objectives for this NCI early K99/R00
award are to: (1) develop a survivorship nutrition intervention, BfedBwell, for implementation within an existing
clinical exercise oncology program; and (2) determine the impact of the intervention on diet and health through
the integration of multi-omic approaches. In the K99 phase, I will utilize the Multiphase Optimization Strategy
(MOST) framework, an engineering-based approach to efficiently and systematically develop, optimize, and
evaluate behavioral interventions, to test three social cognitive theory-based components: (1) 1:1 counseling
with a registered dietitian, (2) behavioral skills development, and (3) group support for delivery alongside a core
nutrition education curriculum within a clinical exercise oncology program. Post-treatment survivors (n=80) with
ow/ob will complete a 12-week cluster-randomized 2^3 factorial trial to test candidate intervention components
for feasibility and acceptability and to identify a set of components that demonstrates patterns of efficacy for
increased adherence to lifestyle recommendations, weight loss, and improvements in cardiometabolic health. In
the R00 phase, I will utilize targeted metabolomics to measure changes in biomarkers of dietary exposure
through analysis of participant biospecimens collected before and after the intervention. I will then perform
integrated network analysis using multi-omics (metabolome, proteome, microbiome) to examine the effects of
the intervention on cardiometabolic health. My K99 mentorship and training plan will provide skills in behavioral
weight loss trials, MOST study design, and multi-omics integration in survivorship. The R00 phase will advance
my foundational knowledge as I become an expert in identifying and interpreting multi-omic findings and
integrating them into behavioral interventions to predict and evaluate individual response. Completion of these
aims will lay the groundwork for an R01-level optimization trial, leading to advances in care while spanning
behavioral and biological domains to develop precision oncology nutrition strategies for improved survivorship."
10786222,"Summary
Individuals with chronic stroke are characterized by low levels of walking activity, which negatively impacts
post-stroke health and the risk for recurrent stroke. Although walking speed and endurance are logical targets
for improving walking activity, improving them alone rarely translates to more walking activity in the free-living
environment in this group. Individuals with chronic stroke also have low falls efficacy, which includes their
confidence in performing daily activities without falling. Evidence suggests that, if the low falls efficacy of those
with chronic stroke is not addressed, the benefits of improved walking capacity on walking activity won’t be
realized. To date, falls efficacy has been quantified as an aggregate score from self-reported questionnaires,
such as the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. A challenge to addressing falls efficacy after
stroke is that it is likely comprised of distinct balance domains not reflected by an aggregate score. These
balance domains, including anticipatory control, walking balance, and reactive balance, can be considered
independent targets for rehabilitation. The ABC scale contains questions relevant to each of these domains. By
aggregating the score, however, the ABC scale does not inform the specific balance intervention targets that
could be used to address falls efficacy and, subsequently, walking activity. Our study aims are to 1)
demonstrate that the construct of falls efficacy in those with chronic stroke is comprised of multiple factors
representing distinct balance domains, and 2) demonstrate that falls efficacy has specific, factor-based
relationships with walking activity in those with chronic stroke. These aims will be addressed using secondary
analyses of ABC scale data within the University of Delaware Stroke Studies Registry, as well as baseline ABC
scale and sensor-based walking data from a multi-site clinical trial in those with chronic stroke (PI: Reisman).
To address the first aim, we will conduct a factor analysis of ABC scale questions to objectively identify unique
domains within the falls efficacy construct. To address the second aim, we will predict walking activity volume,
frequency, intensity, and sedentary behavior from factor-specific ABC scale data. The results of this study will
advance the specificity and utility of the ABC scale in characterizing falls efficacy, as well as informing domain-
specific balance targets for improving falls efficacy and walking activity."
10791874,"Complement is a humoral innate immune system that plays an important role in host defense and in bridging
adaptive immunity. Under certain conditions, complement activation can also cause significant autologous
tissue injury leading to complement-mediated diseases. Complement is activated via three different pathways;
one of which is by the lectin pathway (LP) which is triggered by collagen-like soluble pattern recognition
molecules (PRMs). Upon binding of PRMs to sugar molecules on microbes or altered self-tissues, a specific
group of proteases called MASPs are activated. Activation of MASPs is the key step in LP complement
activation and the ensuing host defense response or tissue injury consequence. The mechanism of action of
MASPs in vivo has not been well understood and recent studies have revealed a surprising link between
MASP3 and the alternative pathway (AP) complement activation. It has been shown that MASP3 plays an
essential role in converting pro-factor D (FD) to mature active FD. The objectives of this proposal are two fold,
1) to understand whether MASP2 and MASP3 play significant roles in complement-mediated pathologies, and
if so, whether targeting these enzyme represents a feasible therapeutic approach; and 2) to understand how
FD activity is regulated in vivo by MASP3 and a putative serine protease inhibitor(s). To this end, we propose
three specific aims in this project. Specific aim 1. To use MASP2 KO mice and blocking mAbs and test the role
of MASP2 and LP in complement-mediated diseases. Specific aim 2. To use MASP3 KO mice and blocking
mAbs and test the role of MASP3 in regulating AP complement activity and as a therapeutic target in AP
complement-dependent diseases. Specific aim 3. To test the hypothesis that maturation of pro-FD by MASP3
is not a default reaction, but rather a regulated process, and that constitutive, unregulated mature FD activity
leads to AP complement consumption via Factor B cleavage which can be exploited therapeutically. These
studies will provide proof of concept for therapeutically targeting MASP2 and MASP3, as well as add new
fundamental knowledge on how FD and AP complement activity is regulated in vivo."

Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen that provokes a diverse array of human diseases, ranging from
mild skin lesions to invasive and life-threatening infections. The success of S. aureus as a pathogen is attributed
to its resistance to antibiotic therapy and production of surface adhesins and glycopolymers, as well as secreted
proteins such as cytolysins, superantigens, and proteases, many of which play vital roles in immune evasion.
S. aureus also produces extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) that encapsulate cargo that includes
lipoproteins, nucleic acids, glycopolymers, adhesins, and exoproteins, including proteases and pore-forming
toxins. Numerous studies have characterized MV production from cultures of various S. aureus isolates and
demonstrated the multiple biological activities of MVs in vitro and in vivo. However, the generation of MVs in vivo
during staphylococcal infection remains unproven, resulting in questions about the biological relevance of MVs
and their contribution to microbial virulence. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biological
roles of MVs in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections. The objective of this proposal is to characterize
the production of S. aureus MVs in vivo to better understand their contributions to disease. The central hypothesis
is that release of MVs is a critical virulence mechanism by which S. aureus targets host cells while protecting the
MV cargo from destruction by environmental factors. This expectation is based on published findings showing
that S. aureus MVs purified from in vitro cultures encapsulate a variety of virulence determinants with pronounced
biological activities. Preliminary data in this application show that S. aureus MVs are generated in a murine air
pouch infection model. This project will establish and optimize methodology for the purification and analysis of
S. aureus MVs recovered from infected animals. The specific aims of the application are to: (1) Characterize the
production of S. aureus MVs during infection – murine air pouch and pneumonia models. The pneumonia model
will allow a more comprehensive understanding of S. aureus MV production in a model resembling human
disease. The protein composition of S. aureus MVs generated in vitro vs. in vivo will be characterized by LC-
MS/MS. If the MV protein content differs in vitro vs. in vivo, RNA-Seq analysis will be performed on S. aureus
bacteria cultivated in vitro vs. in vivo to correlate gene expression with MV protein cargo. (2) Evaluate the
biological effects of “in vivo” MVs on the host. To uncouple the biological responses to MVs from those elicited
by bacterial cells, physiologically relevant numbers of MVs purified from air pouch and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluids will be used for (a) in vitro cytotoxicity assays and (b) to inoculate naive mice. The animals will be monitored
for leukocyte influx, cytokine levels, and tissue pathology. To accomplish these goals, a multidisciplinary
approach will be taken that combines microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, immunology, and animal
models. Knowledge gained from these studies will deepen the currently limited understanding of the role that
MVs play in bacterial pathogenesis, especially those produced by Gram-positive pathogens."
10788858,"Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is recognized as a strong risk factor for the development of late-onset
Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). To better understand the impact of ApoE genotype on the emergence and
progression of LOAD and to effectively evaluate therapeutic interventions for this condition appropriate
experimental animal models are needed. To date, most animal model studies designed to address the
contributions of ApoE genotype to AD have largely centered around the use of transgenic mice. Typically, most
transgenic lines for AD rely on highly artificial over-expression of transgenes and largely incorporate one or
more early-onset FAD mutations in AbPP or presenilin. Moreover, transgenic animals are prone to
developmental and insertional effects on the host genome and are susceptible to loss of transgene expression
and genetic drift in subsequent generations. In addition to these caveats, another major shortcoming of
transgenic lines is that any AD pathology that develops typically is from a ‘sole source’ of transgene
expression. In most cases, the ‘sole source’ of transgenic proteins results from strong over-expression in
neuronal cells. With regards to AD, it is known that besides neurons neighboring astrocytes and microglia can
express AbPP, produce Ab peptides and participate in AD pathogenesis. In addition, vascular cell types
including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes all express AbPP, produce Ab peptides and
reside at the site of CAA, a common vascular co-morbidity of LOAD. Since the complexity of the cellular origins
of Ab in AD are not captured in ‘sole source’ transgenic models they fail to reveal the true pathogenesis of this
disorder and an accurate understanding of the impact of ApoE. This glaring shortcoming has prompted the
quest to generate better experimental animal models for LOAD that more fully capture the pathogenesis of this
condition and more accurately reflect human disease.
 The overall goal of this exploratory proposal is to study the impact of ApoE genotype on the emergence
and progression of LOAD pathologies and cognitive impairment using a novel gene-edited rat model
(CrHuAb) used to generate bigenic CrHuAb/hApoE3 and CrHuAb/hApoE4 rats. These novel and timely rats
will provide superior, state-of-the-art preclinical models that will more realistically reflect the true pathogenesis
of LOAD that develops in patients compared to transgenic mice commonly used in the field."
10788937,"ABSTRACT. Oral health is a vital component of overall health, especially in older adulthood. Nonetheless, as
individuals age into older adulthood, they experience more significant oral health problems and challenges with
utilizing dental care. However, there is limited research about how earlier life characteristics, especially
stressful experiences, influence older adults' oral health and dental care. A widespread stressful life event in
the United States with potentially harmful implications for oral health is incarceration. The United States
currently has the highest incarceration rate in the world and has experienced a nearly 300% increase in the
incarceration rate of older adults over the past three decades, leaving millions of older adults either currently or
formerly incarcerated. Prior research among adolescents and young adults finds incarceration is a risk factor
for worse oral health and not utilizing dental care services. However, no previous research has assessed the
impact of earlier life incarceration on oral health and dental care among older adults over 50. The proposed
study breaks new ground by providing the first comprehensive investigation of the influence of incarceration on
the oral health and dental care of older adults in the United States. To study this topic, we will leverage
longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 14,293)—the only nationally representative
dataset of individuals over 50 in the U.S. with measures of oral health, dental care utilization, and incarceration
history. This study has three aims. Aim 1 will examine the association between incarceration history and
incarceration duration, with edentulism and dental care utilization, focusing on variations by race and ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, and overall health. Aim 2 identifies socioeconomic factors and health behaviors that
mediate the relationship between the history of incarceration and edentulism and dental care utilization. Aim 3
uses the longitudinal nature of the Health and Retirement Study from 2014 to 2022 to assess how
incarceration history corresponds to trajectories of edentulism and dental care utilization over time. The
conclusions of this research can provide an evidence base necessary to understand oral health inequities
among formerly incarcerated older adults and spur interventions to connect formerly incarcerated older adults
to dental care systems to improve oral health and overall health."
10788802,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 Hematopoiesis is a demand-adapted system in which self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and
downstream hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) integrate signals from their bone marrow (BM)
niche microenvironment to adapt blood production to the needs of the organism. In regenerative conditions, this
results in the transient engagement of stereotypical emergency myelopoiesis (EM) pathways, which consist of
transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic mechanisms that do not usually operate under native conditions, but
act to prioritize rapid production of myeloid cells at the expense of other blood lineages before returning to ho-
meostasis. In contrast, in maladaptive contexts like chronic inflammation, leukemia, or aging, EM pathways are
constitutively engaged and drive overproduction of myeloid cells that often have altered effector function. Our
previous work established EM pathways as a distinct trajectory of myeloid development that depends on unique
HSPC signaling states and cell behavior. Our proposed work in this new NHLBI OIA application will build upon
the fundamental biology of EM pathways that we have uncovered to 1) explore the importance of EM pathway
activation for essential immune responses such as trained immunity, myeloid cell heterogeneity, and immuno-
suppressive tumor microenvironment; 2) establish a novel BM-on-chip platform to model the environmental
crosstalk between niche and HSPCs in regulating EM pathway activation; and 3) translate our finding of EM
pathway activation in mice into the human system. We will use state-of-the-art experimental approaches focusing
on the study of defined hematopoietic populations and emerging properties of the BM niche microenvironment,
and will take advantage of the power of transcriptional and epigenetic single cell profiling strategies and spatial
imaging approaches, to ask novel questions that will push the boundary of what is currently known regarding the
regulation of myelopoiesis in adaptive and maladaptive contexts in both mice and humans. Collectively, these
studies are paradigm shifting as they will extend our current understanding of myeloid regeneration mechanisms
into new, uncharted territories with broad translational applications to fight immune deregulations and treat solid
cancers and blood disorders.

10789719,"ABSTRACT
Uterine leiomyomata (UL), endometriosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are debilitating gynecologic
conditions diagnosed in up to 30% of North American women. These conditions are associated with infertility,
pain, menorrhagia, and other sequelae that can profoundly affect quality of life. In the United States (US), annual
health care costs for treating these conditions exceed $3 billion. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is reported by
up to 25% of US women, but there has been limited study of its effects on gynecologic health. CSA has been
associated with altered regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic stress
response, demonstrating long-term effects on health that can persist into adulthood. Emerging research
suggests that exposure to CSA influences risk of gynecologic conditions. MPIs of the present application, Drs.
Boynton-Jarrett and Wise, have published studies from two US cohorts showing that early life abuse
victimization, particularly CSA, was associated with greater UL incidence and that resilience factors may mitigate
the adverse effects of CSA. Given the dearth of research in this area, and the potential role of moderators and
mediators, greater study of the effects of CSA on the occurrence of gynecological diseases is critical. With
ongoing NIH funding since 2013 (R01-HD086742), Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) has enrolled and
followed more than 17,200 female-identified participants—including more than 3,200 participants who identify
as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)—residing in the US and Canada. Comprehensive data are
collected on socio-demographics, diet, behaviors, medical history, medication use, mental health, and stress,
including data on social determinants of health such as adverse childhood experiences, abuse, financial
hardship, and discrimination, as well as measures of resilience, social and emotional support, and coping. This
application will leverage the existing PRESTO infrastructure to assess the following hypotheses: CSA will be
associated with a greater risk of UL, endometriosis, and PCOS. Greater social and emotional support, resilience,
coping skills, and neighborhood cohesion will buffer these associations. Mental health conditions—depression,
anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—that develop after abuse initiation but before onset of
gynecologic conditions will mediate these associations. This study will be one of the largest investigations of
CSA and gynecologic disease. Added strengths include the comprehensive collection of data on abuse and other
adversities across the life course; proposed validation of gynecologic diseases using medical records; collection
of extensive data on potential moderators, mediators, and confounders; geographically dispersed and racially
diverse study population; and interdisciplinary research team. Preliminary data from PRESTO indicate wide
variability in exposure to CSA. Future research could build on this foundational work by linking CSA, gynecologic
disease, and fertility and perinatal outcomes in PRESTO. Findings could identify feasible targets for intervention,
and identify individuals who might benefit from greater provision of health care resources and social support."
10933036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This R34 application aims to develop and test an innovative mobile application (app) to reduce college student
drinking and sexual assault risk in real time. Over 75% of campus sexual assaults involve alcohol, yet existing
campus alcohol and SA prevention efforts designed for universal delivery are often siloed and limited in their
ability to provide students with in-the-moment assistance to reduce risk. Smartphone apps are an integral part
of college student life and are increasingly used to engage students in real-time alcohol prevention; however,
none have integrated alcohol and sexual assault prevention into a single cross-cutting tool. This study
addresses this gap by expanding a promising campus sexual assault prevention and response app
(uSafeUS®) to include evidence-based alcohol harm reduction tools and real-time messaging to support
students’ use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) in the moments when they most need them. The
uSafeUS app, currently in use on 24 US college campuses, utilizes sexual assault PBS (e.g., sharing current
locations and an expected return home time with trusted peers) as the primary risk reduction mechanism for
students to use in social contexts where alcohol is present, yet none of the existing features directly address
alcohol consumption. This project will leverage the existing uSafeUS infrastructure and a proven user-centered
development process to expand app features to include an interactive drink tracker and personalized feedback
messaging to reduce alcohol consumption and increase PBS use. The expanded app (uSafeUS+) will be beta
tested in an open trial to gather end-user (student) and campus administrator feedback about the app’s
practical utility in the field and feasibility of the proposed implementation and evaluation plans. This will be
followed by a pilot 3-arm randomized controlled trial (N = 90, 30/arm) to examine the acceptability, feasibility,
and initial efficacy of uSafeUS+, relative to active (uSafeUS) and assessment-only control groups. In the short
term, results from the current study will optimize the planned app and inform a fully powered multi-site hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial. Longer term, findings have the potential to inform the use of mHealth
approaches for integrating prevention tools to universally deliver personalized real time prevention on college
campuses where heavy drinking and sexual assault often co-occur."
10791667,"As one of the most common and impairing disorders among adolescents, Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is
helping to drive the ongoing mental health crisis in American youth. After their return to school following
pandemic lockdowns, SAD has become even more prevalent and impairing in youth, and it is accompanied by
higher rates of Depression. Although exposure-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is effective for
anxiety disorders in youth, 40-50% do not respond to it, and problems with treatment acceptance and dropout
interfere with its real-world effectiveness. We have developed an efficacious exposure treatment for people
with Specific Phobia that does not evoke distress and thus avoidance behaviors. Very Brief Exposure (VBE)
is the presentation of a series of masked pictures representing a person’s fears (e.g., judgmental faces),
repeated many times in an exposure session. Ten RCTs have established VBE as an efficacious treatment for
Specific Phobia, consistently showing that it promotes tolerance of in vivo exposure to the feared situation, with
moderate to large effect sizes. VBE can be delivered in a clinic without the need for trained therapists, at very
low cost, making it potentially a highly scalable adjunctive intervention. Our goal is to develop VBE from the
treatment of transition-age youth with Spider Phobia to adolescents with SAD. To create VBE for SAD, we will:
(1) create an ecologically valid VBE intervention for SAD; and (2) identify the neural circuits that VBE activates,
and relate these circuit activations to effects on fear responses. These aims will allow us to determine if VBE
engages the same neural circuits in SAD that we have established as a target mechanism in Specific Phobia.
35 youth with SAD and 35 healthy controls, ages 16-22, will each receive: (1) VBE to SAD-relevant stimuli; (2)
clearly visible exposure (CVE) to the same SAD stimuli; and (3) exposure to control stimuli, all during fMRI
scanning. They will provide periodic fear ratings, and we will continuously record skin conductance during the
exposures. CVE is an active control condition used to manipulate conscious awareness of exposure and
thereby illustrate the potential advantages of masked exposure (VBE) in engaging extinction circuits and
reducing fear responses. Our thesis is that exposure is more effective, both in terms of circuit activity and fear
responses, when delivered as the micro-exposures of VBE than as consciously experienced stimuli. These
preliminary data will establish a therapeutic target of VBE in SAD, laying the groundwork for a future R61-R33
proposal to determine whether VBE, when used as an adjunctive therapy, engages the same target to boost
the efficacy of CBT for SAD in a randomized controlled trial. If VBE can be adapted successfully to SAD, it
could be easily incorporated into exposure-based CBT to make it more acceptable for youth by enabling them
to develop exposure tolerance earlier in the process of therapy."
10794361,"The vast majority of pediatric open-heart surgeries require the patient to be supported by cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB). Exposure to CPB causes systemic inflammation and resultant multi-organ dysfunction. Post-CPB
inflammation is believed to be caused by exposure of the patient’s blood cells to the plastic tubing of the CPB
circuit and unphysiological high shear stress. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are unclear.
Our long-term goal is to understand how these insults contribute to post-CPB inflammation and translate this
knowledge into novel treatment strategies. The scientific premise for this project is that Receptor-Interacting
serine/threonine-Protein Kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling is a novel mediator of CPB associated inflammation that
can be targeted to improve outcomes for neonatal cardiac surgery patients. Data from neonatal CBP patients, a
large animal model of CPB, and in vitro experiments form the basis of our scientific premise. We recently
published that RIPK3 and necroptosis play a role in post-CPB inflammation. Our data demonstrate that RIPK3
plays a role in post-CPB inflammation. We established that supraphysiologic shear stresses present during CPB
are sufficient to activate RIPK3 signaling in vitro and in a piglet model of CPB. Mechanistically, we found that
shear stress-initiated calcium signaling pathways are critical to the activation of monocytic cells. We have
identified specific pathways that can be targeted with small molecules to reduce CPB-activation of RIPK3 with
goal of reducing systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction. We hypothesize that CPB-associated
shear stress activates RIPK3 mediated inflammation. The objectives of this proposal are 1) to determine how
CPB activates RIPK3 signaling, 2) elucidate how RIPK3 signaling contributes to CPB-associated
inflammation/organ dysfunction, and 3) determine if blocking RIPK3 signaling is sufficient to reduce CPB-
associated inflammation and organ dysfunction. Our approach will consist of two specific aims:
Aim 1. Determine how shear stress activates RIPK3 signaling in circulating myeloid cells.
We postulate that supraphysiologic shear stress is sufficient to activate RIPK3 signaling. We will characterize
the shear stress thresholds and molecular mechanism responsible for RIPK3 activation during CPB with a focus
on the roles that the cell cortex, calcium signaling cascade, and shear responsive kinases play in this response.
Aim 2. Demonstrate that RIPK3 signaling mediates CPB-associated inflammation and organ dysfunction.
We postulate that RIPK3 signaling is required for the inflammatory response to CPB. RIPK3 can help propagate
inflammation via necroptosis, the release of cytokines, and leukocyte migration. We will perform in vitro and in
vivo experiments to demonstrate that targeting RIPK3 signaling reduces CPB-associated inflammation.
This research is novel and significant – elucidating how CPB activates RIPK3 signaling and necroptosis could
enable a new treatment paradigm for CPB patients, improve outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs, since the
proposed signaling pathways can be targeted by small molecules in clinical use or pre-clinical development."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is surrounded by one of the thickest and most impenetrable cell walls of any
known bacterium. This structure is not unlike that of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria but creates
a far more extreme permeability barrier for nutrients. Other bacterial species with such an outer membrane
generally have porins that allow uptake of water-soluble nutrients, but Mtb and most pathogenic mycobacteria
do not. The mechanisms by which Mtb transports nutrients across the outer membrane in the absence of
classical porins remain largely unknown. The absence of porins in mycobacterial species is strikingly well
correlated with an expansion of proteins belonging to the Pro-Glu (PE) and Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) protein families.
These PE/PPE proteins have been one of the most perplexing puzzles in tuberculosis biology: The 169 family
members are scattered throughout the genome, take up ~10% of Mtb’s genetic coding capacity, and are almost
exclusively found in pathogenic mycobacteria. Their sequences are highly unusual and characterized by
intrinsically disordered repeat regions. Their large number, disordered structure, and unusual length has made
the PE/PPE proteins equally difficult to work with by genetic, structural, and biochemical approaches. Over
twenty years after their discovery, they remain some of the most intractable proteins and their function remains
largely unknown. We and others now discovered an unexpected function of a subset of the PE/PPE proteins as
nutrient transporters across the outer membrane of Mtb. Here, we will test the hypothesis that the PE/PPE
proteins are a large family of transporters that shuttle nutrients across the Mtb outer membrane and that might
also be responsible for drug uptake and efflux, thus affecting Mtb drug resistance."

Limb congenital defects are among the most common causes of disability in the United States affecting
0.8/1000 children born each year. Recent realizations of plausible regenerative medicine therapies in
humans has increased efforts towards understanding examples of animal regeneration and the
mechanisms that drive the process. In this proposal, we aim to provide insight into the mechanisms
that facilitate regeneration by studying a clinically relevant signaling molecule, retinoic acid, during limb
regeneration in the salamander. Axolotl salamanders (Ambystoma mexicanum) are particularly useful,
because they regenerate entire limbs after amputation by generating a heterogeneous mass of lineage-
restricted progenitors called a blastema at the amputation site. The blastema uses positional
information retained in connective tissue cells to regenerate the proper limb regions. The goal of this
proposal is to the endogenous role in this process and study how positional information is established
and maintained in connective tissue cells, which is critical to our understanding of limb regeneration.
We will use unbiased single cell RNAseq and spatial transcriptomic approaches to compare gene
expression at single-cell resolution throughout the regeneration process. We will also determine the
transcriptional targets of retinoic acid specifically in limb connective tissue cells that are undergoing
reprogramming from distal to proximal cell identity. Lastly, the positional memory of connective tissue
cells will be experimentally programmed in vivo to demonstrate how positional memory is maintained.
In the end, the major outcome of this project will be to know how a salamander limb knows what limb
structures to grow back in order to stimulate new regenerative approaches in mammalian systems."

 Cerebral palsy (CP) is a devastating disease usually originating from hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) before birth. It
has one of the very highest indices of burden of disease. The costs to society are huge, to the tune of $15
billion. Prevention of a single CP patient would save almost $1.2 million dollars, not factoring indirect costs to
parents, siblings, communities and society from life-long commitments. The number of affected CP patients,
800,000 in USA, and burden of disease is higher than many adult neurological diseases affecting the twilight
years. Yet, there is a paucity of effective therapies for CP. To solve the problems of finding new
neuroprotectants that can be translated to the humans situation, we are proposing to test novel specific
inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy based on human acute
placental insufficiency and the clinical paradigm of placental abruption. These new nNOS inhibitors are the
most potent neuroprotectants found in our laboratory. We utilize MRI biomarkers that inform us about the
immediate fetal brain response to H-I and reliably predict which rabbit fetuses will manifest motor deficits after
delivery. We utilize recent advances in detecting oxidative and nitrosative stress (caused by reactive nitrogen
species derived from nitric oxide). Instead of a zero-sum way of looking at oxidative stress and antioxidants,
we posit the biphasic nature of reactive species in brain cell function and that a dance between various
oxidants and antioxidants is necessary for critical brain injury. We hypothesize that the timing and location of
nitrosative stress in important in determining which fetuses will develop motor deficits. The proposed studies
will lead to the development of a neuroprotective strategy that can also be used in resource-poor countries in
addition to developed countries. The first Aim will determine the nature of gray and white matter injury in the
fetal brain. The second Aim will determine whether nitric oxide derived from nNOS is responsible for the critical
brain injury that results in motor deficits. The third Aim will determine the best candidate drug to take to clinical
trials. The new innovations proposed are the systemic integration of MRI as a surrogate marker and high
speed sorting into the unique animal model to probe the biochemical basis of specific neuronal injury at a
critical time point. The clinical importance of this proposal is that the studies will select the most potent and
non-toxic drug in the class of nNOS inhibitors for preventing motor deficits. The proposed studies will thus
provide the systematic development of much-needed therapies for CP not only in USA but throughout the
world."
10792386,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent technological advancements have allowed for single-neuron and intracranial electroencephalographic
(iEEG) recordings in freely moving humans. However, these implanted neural recording devices have not been
integrated with non-invasive peripheral biochemical recordings. The emergence of an experimental platform
combining mobile deep brain recordings with wearable biochemical and biophysical sensors for use in real-world
settings is unprecedented. The proposed project will develop a novel platform that enables simultaneous single-
neuron or iEEG, biochemical (cortisol, epinephrine), and biophysical (heart rate, skin conductance, and body
and eye movements) activity to be recorded in freely moving human participants. As proof-of-concept, we will
use this platform to investigate the neural and peripheral biomarker mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance
behaviors during spatial navigation. Through an interdisciplinary collaboration between UCLA, Stanford
University, and the Veteran’s Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS), the program
will have access to human participants whom will have implanted electrodes within prefrontal cortex, amygdala,
hippocampus, or nucleus accumbens regions. The proposed project outcomes will empower future studies and
other researchers to investigate, for the first-time, deep brain and peripheral biomarker mechanisms underlying
freely moving human behavior in naturalistic and ecologically valid environments."
10914487,"Project Summary
Suicide is much higher in Veterans compared to non-Veterans and thus remains a major health crisis in the
VA, but there are few treatments available that directly target core features of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
Rumination is the strong tendency to engage in self-critical repetitive thinking that is often difficult to interrupt
and is associated with suicide attempts and the transition from suicidal ideation to intent above and beyond
other suicide risk factors. Meta-analyses indicate that abnormalities in brain regions comprising the “default
mode network,” which play a role in daydreaming or mind-wandering, contribute to the maintenance of
rumination. More specifically, deficits in the medial orbital frontal cortex, which plays a crucial role in inhibition,
could allow seemingly innocuous stimuli to become integrated with autobiographical features of the self via the
precuneus and the over personalization of negative stimuli leading to rumination, thus highlighting a neural
circuit through which rumination may be perpetuated and a potential target for intervention. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging studies have provided key insights into the neurobiology of suicide, but has had
little direct impact on clinical care thus far. With the advent of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
neurofeedback, however, there is now the potential to implement personalized strategies for altering brain
activity associated with rumination to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the proposed study we will
determine the acceptability and feasibility of using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
neurofeedback to reduce suicide-specific rumination, defined as “repetitive mental fixation on one's suicidal
thoughts and intentions” in a transdiagnostic sample of 15 Veterans at elevated risk of suicide. We will also
assess pre- to post-treatment changes in measures of suicide-specific rumination, disability, functional
impairment, and quality of life in Veterans with a suicide attempt history following 2 real-time functional
magnetic resonance imaging sessions (each one lasting ~50 minutes). Veterans will be provided signals from
the brain to identify mental strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) for reducing the connectivity influence of the
medial orbital frontal cortex on the precuneus. During a subsequent “transfer” period Veterans will be asked to
utilize the mental strategy that worked best for altering this connectivity, but without receiving any
neurofeedback signals from the brain. Post-treatment clinical assessments will occur following each of the 2 rt-
fMRI neurofeedback sessions and at 1 month following the second fMRI neurofeedback session. The novelty
of the proposed work is underscored by the paucity of work using real-time functional magnetic resonance
imaging neurofeedback in a Veteran population and the lack of studies to date targeting a brain network to
reduce suicide-specific rumination. In this SPiRE application we will test the following specific aims: (1) to
determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
neurofeedback in a Veteran population experiencing suicide-specific rumination; (2) to identify changes in
suicide-specific rumination following rt-fMRI neurofeedback and (3) to identify changes in functional impairment
and quality of life following rt-fMRI neurofeedback. The proposed study is consistent with the mission of RR&D
to maximize Veterans’ functional independence, quality of life and participation in their lives and community
and the SPiRE mechanism to fund studies for “feasibility of an intervention.” These data will guide a future VA
Merit Award application using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test the efficacy of rt-
fMRI neurofeedback as a first-line treatment intervention for reducing suicide-specific rumination in Veterans."
10793794,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory diseases include a vast array of disorders including, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, hepatitis, and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among others. The ability to image inflammation in vivo is critical to improve
the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying various disease etiologies. Current technologies to image
IBD suffer from using radiation, lack of specificity, high cost, or invasive procedures that carry risk from both
sedation or anesthesia and colonic perforation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a noninvasive
imaging modality that accurately identify early inflammatory changes, that can be used longitudinally to monitor
the status of disease. With the use of a newly emerging imaging technology, multispectral optoacoustic
tomography (MSOT), MSOT has potential for detecting inflammation and has the capability to detect multiple
contrast agents simultaneously. The development of contrast agents detectable for this modality has largely
explored nanomaterials, dye-labeled peptides, or dye-labeled antibodies. Although synthetic contrast agents for
molecular imaging have shown great efficacy on disease diagnosis in preclinical trials, many of these synthetic
agents have limitations such as low biocompatibility, material-associated toxicity, poor clearance, and high cost
of pilot scale production. To overcome these limitations, the objective is to develop the first probiotic bacterial-
based contrast agent to monitor inflammation using MSOT.
Probiotics comprise primarily lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) and are designated as generally
regarded as safe organisms by FDA. L. lactis is well established as an efficient expression system for
recombinant proteins and is being intensively investigated for delivery of antigens and cytokines at the mucosal
level. It was demonstrated that the blue color generated from L. lactis-Blue (LlB) is detectable by MSOT. The
goal is to bioengineer a stimuli-responsive L. lactis-Blue and dual label it with Zn-DPA-CF750 to result in a
bacteria-based dual labeled contrast agent to monitor inflammation, using colitis as an inflammatory model, by
MSOT. The hypothesis is that endogenous hemoglobin alone with MSOT will be insufficient to monitor chronic
inflammatory diseases, thus, the proposed single or dual bacterial-based contrast agent, will target inflammation
and provide additional molecular information to facilitate monitoring of inflammatory diseases. This hypothesis
will be tested as follow: 1) Engineer and characterize LIB as a biologically-based contrast detectable using
MSOT, 2) Construct and characterize L. lactis-750 and LIB-750 as single and dual bacterial-based contrast
agents detectable using MSOT, and 3) Determine the potential of LIB, L-750, and LIB-750 as biological contrast
agents to identify areas of inflammation using MSOT in a mouse model of colitis. Collectively, this proposal
represents one of the first developments of a bacterial-based optoacoustic detectable contrast agent to further
enhance the detection of inflammation associated with colitis."

People with psychotic disorders die 10-20 years prematurely, often after years of disability and declining
health. Early-onset dementia is an important contributor to these problems. By age 65, 27% of people with
psychotic disorders are already diagnosed with dementia. The nature of this premature cognitive decline is
unclear, and RFA-MH-22-270 calls for studies to understand the increased risk of dementia in psychotic
disorders. Specifically, it is unknown when the cognitive decline takes place, why it happens, and what are its
functional consequences. The Suffolk County Mental Health Project, a longitudinal epidemiologic study of first-
episode psychosis that begun in 1989, provides an unparalleled opportunity to study cognitive decline in
psychotic disorder during midlife. The study enrolled 628 individuals with psychotic disorders. At Year 20, 261
demographically matched never-psychotic adults were added. The cohorts have been genotyped, and have
received comprehensive psychiatric evaluations, medical exams, physical performance tests, EEG, and
cognitive testing at regular intervals throughout the follow-up period. This created a rich dataset that has
already been the basis of over 115 publications. We propose a 35-year follow-up, when participants will be 65
years old on average (expected N = 530). The proposed study has four aims. First, we will determine whether
the cognitive decline from Year 20 to 35 is faster in cases than never-psychotic controls. Second, we will test if
Year 20 risk factors for cognitive change are the same in cases and controls (e.g., metabolic syndrome,
inactivity, tobacco use, low education, and APOE4) or some differ (e.g., antipsychotics, anticholinergics, and
schizophrenia polygenic risk score). Third, we will investigate in cases whether cognitive decline is associated
with worsening functioning in the real-world (role, social, and self-care), physical impairment, and neural
deficits (EEG and plasma markers). Fourth, we will explore dementia incidence in cases vs. controls and risk
factors for incident dementia. The proposed research will address scientific objectives highlighted in the RFA-
MH-22-270. First, it will explicate trajectories and outcomes of psychotic disorders in mid- to late-life by
studying cognitive and functional changes over 15 years (from mean age 50 to age 65). Second, it will identify
promising targets for future development of preventive interventions by investigating modifiable risk factors.
Third, it will shed light on mechanisms underpinning these trajectories by studying relevant genetic, molecular,
neural, environmental, and behavioral factors."
10793356,"The overall goal of this project is to create a murine-models for grade IV brain tumors that will be sensitive to HSV-1 infection and can be utilized to evaluate oncolytic HSV-1 (oHSV) derived viruses utility and safety for grade IV brain tumors. Grade IV primary brain tumors are associated with a very poor prognosis, and despite surgery and use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and tumor treating field delivering devices patient survival remains dismal. Hence there is an urgent need for alternative therapies. Oncolytic HSV-1 based viral therapy (oHSV) is a promising biological therapy for solid tumor. oHSV is currently approved for treatment of metastatic melanoma in USA and Europe. Another oHSV recently was given conditional approval for treatment of recurrent GBM in Japan. Several oHSV are currently being investigated for safety and efficiency for brain tumors include G207, HSV1716, M032 and rQuestin34.5. Additional development of novel and second-generation viruses is also actively being pursued in many laboratories. However, the species-specific nature of virus and host interactions presents a challenge in currently available murine models. Thus a mouse model that is immune competent, produces reproducible tumors, and is permissive to HSV-1 would help expedite safety and efficacy testing of this new and promising biotherapy. An animal model that is immune competent, permissive to HSV-1, not overly immunogenic, and shows reproducible and efficient tumor growth would be ideal to test oHSV based biotherapies. Here we propose to create an animal model recapitulates the effect of HSV-1 on tumor cells and the immune environment but still has an ECM environment consisting of microglia, endothelial cells etc. that are also permissive. A syngeneic murine GBM model, that is permissive to HSV-1 infection without being overly immunogenic and shows a 100% tumor take in mice upon transplantation would be ideal. We have created transgenic mice that express human Nectin-1 to permit efficient virus entry. We will use NSC from these mice to create brain tumor cells that mimic human brain tumor genetic alterations and evaluate them for tumor take and response to oHSV therapy."

The overall goal of this project is to understand whether exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) during
development has long-lasting effects on neuropsychiatric traits in adulthood, including identifying sensitive
periods, the neural bases of these effects, and evaluating if the effects of exposure are moderated by specific
genetic risk factors. Whereas there has been considerable research linking PM2.5 exposure to poor
cardiovascular and respiratory health, PM2.5’s impact on mental health is only beginning to be appreciated. As
such, several fundamental questions pertaining to the long-term neuropsychiatric effect of PM2.5 exposure
remain unaddressed. Of particular importance is determining whether exposure to PM2.5 at distinct
developmental timepoints has differential effects on adult psychiatric and neuroanatomical outcomes. It also
remains unknown the degree to which genetic risk factors may make individuals more susceptible to
neuropsychiatric effects of exposure. By better understanding the relationships between PM2.5 and adult
neuropsychiatric outcomes, as well as the genetic factors driving individual differences in these relationships,
we may gain insight into the specific biological pathways linking PM2.5 exposure to mental illness. In the current
proposal, we will address these issues in a well characterized sample of over 700 participants who have been
followed for the first three decades of life. Integrating across geospatial, neuroimaging, psychiatric, and genetic
methodologies, we will pursue two complementary aims. In Specific Aim #1, we will test for effects of PM2.5
exposure at multiple developmental timepoints on individual differences in psychiatric outcomes in young
adulthood. We hypothesize that PM2.5 exposure is an environmental risk factor associated with higher severity
of transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, but that the specific timing and trajectory of exposure has differential
effects on this risk. Furthermore, we test whether the trajectory of developmental exposure influences the
trajectory of mental illness across the lifespan, providing insight into whether reducing PM2.5 levels across
development may ameliorate effects of perinatal exposure. In Specific Aim #2, we will leverage neuroimaging
and molecular genetic data to investigate the biological bases through which developmental PM2.5 exposure
affects the brain and subsequent mental illness. In neuroimaging analyses, we determine whether PM2.5
exposure at different developmental timepoints leads to neuroanatomical alterations in distinct brain systems.
In molecular genetic analyses, we utilized pathway-specific polygenic risk scores to test for gene-by-
environment interactions which influence the effects of PM2.5 exposure on neuropsychiatric outcomes. We
hypothesize genetic risk for adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure on these outcomes will be isolated to specific
biological pathways related to immune response and oxidative stress. Taken together, these aims provide a
targeted research plan to begin to identify the biological pathways through which environmental toxins may
affect mental health decades into the future."

Consistent with the overall mission of NINDS for the PAR-21-056 Announcement, Analytical Validation of a
Candidate Biomarker for Neurological Disease, we have assembled a team of investigators from the International
Initiative on Traumatic Brain Injury Research (IntBIR) to conduct analytical validation of 7 emerging TBI
biomarkers: UCH-L1, GFAP, NfL, Tau, brain derived (BD) Tau, pTau-181 and pTau-231. The absolute values
reported for any particular analyte, measured on different platforms, often differ substantially, making it difficult
to interpret findings across studies and limiting their eventual clinical adoption. To achieve clinical acceptance,
assessment of pre-analytical variables, namely how small variations of sample collection protocols and analytical
methods influence the results, is essential for establishing standard operating procedures. Universal cut-offs and
population-based reference intervals (RI) also will assist in interpretation of biomarker results. Such efforts in the
pre-competitive space will substantially ease the transition from research-use-only into clinical practice. This will
be the first study to investigate the role of neurotrauma biomarkers as monitoring biomarkers of the temporal
evolution of TBI in two common clinical Contexts of Use (COU). We will assay existing blood samples collected
in > 80 hospitals worldwide as part of the USA TRACK-TBI study, the European CENTER-TBI study, and the
Canadian CanTBI study, for the 7 biomarkers selected for this project. The first COU focuses on patients
evaluated in the ED and discharged to their home. We will investigate the risk stratification/prognostic value of
these TBI biomarkers to detect or predict the occurrence of persistent post-concussion syndrome. The second
COU focuses on patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe TBI. We will investigate the relationship
and effect size of secondary biomarker elevations with TBI complications such as intracranial hypertension, as
a neuromonitoring role. These pre-competitive space studies are important for the development of these
biomarkers in the TBI arena, as well as the near future use and adoption in the acute clinical setting."
10793870,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In stroke-induced aphasia, deficits in auditory comprehension are prevalent, which has negative consequences
for everyday communication and quality of life, as well as speech-language assessment and treatment.
Auditory comprehension is not a monolithic process, but rather relies on processing multidimensional acoustic
and linguistic cues contained in spoken language. There are few clinical tools available for identifying level(s)
of auditory comprehension deficit(s) in aphasia, with typical assessments limited to single words and
sentences. While such assessments may allow for precise identification of where deficits exist, they lack
ecological validity. Moreover, these tasks require overt responses which utilize cognitive resources beyond
those required for auditory comprehension, impeding precise characterization of deficits. Recent computational
advances allow for objective examination of neural correlates of auditory comprehension across levels of
processing (e.g., spectrotemporal, lexical) using an ecologically valid task wherein individuals listen to
continuous speech while electroencephalography (EEG) responses are collected, with no overt responses
required. This approach, temporal response function (TRF) modeling, involves fitting a linear function to map
multivariate features of the continuous speech stimulus (e.g., spectrogram, lexical frequency) onto the EEG
data. The resulting TRF is used to derive a predicted EEG, and the relation between the TRF-predicted EEG
and observed EEG provides a measure of the fidelity of neural processing of that feature. TRF modeling has
shown promise for use in clinical populations. However, researchers have yet to assess validity and test-retest
reliability of TRF-derived measures of auditory comprehension in individuals with language disorders, severely
limiting their clinical utility. The proposed study thus has two specific aims: to examine the validity (Aim 1) and
test-retest reliability (Aim 2) of TRF-derived measures of auditory comprehension from the level of
spectrotemporal processing through semantic and syntactic processing. To this end, 40 individuals with stroke-
induced aphasia and 40 older adult control participants will complete a comprehensive cognitive-linguistic
battery comprising tightly controlled tasks and standardized assessments designed to measure different levels
of cognitive-linguistic processing. They will also listen to a continuous narrative while EEG responses are
recorded at two timepoints. TRF modeling will be used to derive measures reflecting neural correlates of
auditory comprehension which will be compared to performance on the cognitive-linguistic battery (Aim 1) and
across the two timepoints (Aim 2). The proposed study has the potential to improve characterization of auditory
comprehension in aphasia. Moreover, knowledge of normal variability across sessions for TRF-derived
measures will help researchers to make informed inferences about treatment-related outcomes or
spontaneous recovery so that test-retest variability is not mistakenly attributed to meaningful change."

The broad, long-term goal of the proposed work is to provide children with severe speech and physical impair-
ments (SSPI) access to effective augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). AAC devices provide a
means of communication for those who find speech communication inefficient or ineffective due to disability. For
children with SSPI, the lack of AAC access options has a devastating impact on quality of life, well-being, and
medical care. By translating brain activity into communication device control, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
for AAC (BCI-AAC) can support access to communication for those with SSPI who find existing methods of AAC
inaccessible, fatiguing, or difficult to learn, and expand AAC options to facilitate multimodal device control. P300-
based BCI-AAC devices use brain activity associated with attention to a target item and provide an encouraging
avenue for children's AAC access due to the simple control task and short training times. However, P300-BCI-
AAC research primarily focuses on developing spelling-based interfaces for adults, with limited research on chil-
dren largely focusing on adolescents (aged ≥13 years), even though cortical maturation impacts the P300 brain
signal. Recent works that employ implementation science frameworks and AAC experts have identified a para-
mount need to build on prior foundational research and extend P300-BCI-AAC access to those in middle child-
hood who may be unable to spell. Problematically, the development of picture-based P300-BCI-AAC systems
for children aged 8–12 years remains largely unexplored. Thus, this project will break new ground in (a) picture-
based P300-BCI-AAC development and (b) clinical translation, by determining initial levels of picture-P300-BCI-
AAC performance for both healthy children and those with SSPI in middle childhood. Further, it will establish
factors impacting BCI-AAC accuracy and children's design preferences. Project outcomes will be vital to achieve
accelerated BCI-AAC success for individuals and the NIDCD's plan for patient-oriented implementation. Aim 1
will determine initial picture-based P300-BCI-AAC performance across two sessions, which will promote comfort,
as BCI-AAC equipment may seem unfamiliar. Aim 2 will provide new knowledge of brain activity underlying
P300-BCI-AAC access and how a range of patient-oriented factors impact accuracy to inform the development
of assessment tools that can accelerate training times. Finally, to promote engagement, Aim 3 will evaluate and
establish the P300-BCI-AAC design preferences of children via the use of a novel BCI-AAC design creation
application. Project findings will have potential to improve communication abilities of children with SSPI via BCI-
AAC and help decrease the impact of disability and risk of preventable adverse medical events (e.g., incorrect
drug administration) while promoting quality of life and social participation. Outcomes will inform larger-scale
investigations to develop assessment materials and inform future research to elucidate how children with SSPI
learn BCI-AAC control in natural environments, alongside how display designs impact performance."
10793888,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cognitive decline is a common component of aging, and spatial memory is especially affected by old
age. Testosterone levels among men decline steadily with aging, paralleling the age-related decline in
cognitive ability, which suggests that there may be a causal link between these two processes. Past
studies have produced mixed results regarding the cognitive benefits of androgen therapies for
hypogonadal aged men, highlighting the need for an animal model to experimentally test the
therapeutic value of testosterone treatment. With increasing age, there is also a transition from the use
of a striatum-dependent response strategy to the use of a hippocampus-dependent place strategy for
solving navigational tasks, and declining testosterone levels may be the cause of this shift. The
proposed experiments will assess the physiological mechanisms underlying testosterone-induced
changes in spatial memory and strategies, using castrated, aged male rats as a model for hypogonadal
aged men. The specific aims of the proposed experiments are to determine: 1) the relative effects of
testosterone and aging on place and response learning in males, 2) the role of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in regulating testosterone-induced changes in spatial memory, and 3) the
role of neural synchrony in regulating testosterone-induced changes in spatial memory. Each
experiment will involve testosterone injections given to castrated male rats from young, middle-aged,
and old groups. In Experiment 1, rats will be injected with three different physiological doses of
testosterone and tested on plus-maze tasks that require the use of either a place or response strategy.
This will test whether testosterone can shift older rats to increase their use of a place strategy, more
typical of younger males. Such behavioral results would suggest improved hippocampal function. To
test this further, BDNF and related markers of neuroplasticity (TrkB, PSD-95) will be assayed from
hippocampal and striatal tissue collected from all subjects. Experiment 2 will test whether BDNF is
necessary for the memory-enhancing effects of testosterone by injecting some subjects intra-cranially
(hippocampus or striatum) with a TrkB antagonist (ANA-12) in combination with testosterone dosing.
Experiment 3 will explore the effects of testosterone on neural connectivity of the hippocampus and
striatum using electrophysiological recordings on active rats. Past work suggests that reduced in-phase
theta waves between the hippocampus and striatum facilitate place learning. Testosterone treatment is,
therefore, expected to reduce in-phase activity, possibly restoring neural synchrony in older rats to that
which is typical of a younger brain. In combination, these experiments will provide a critical step in
determining the therapeutic value of testosterone for treating age-related memory impairment."
10802345,"Summary
Bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens interact closely with mucosal surfaces. Specialized innate and adaptive mucosal
immune systems protect these surfaces and are the first line of defense for the body. One of the more important reasons for
the development of mucosal vaccines is the increasing evidence that stimulating and preparing local mucosal immune
responses is important for protection against infectious against diseases, such as tuberculosis. Although the entire immune
response repertoire needed for protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is not known, recent data in
animal models suggest that vaccine-induced CD4+ cells of the T helper 17 (Th17) cell subtype, which naturally traffic to
the airways, can accelerate the recruitment of protective Th1 cells and production of IFN, IL-17 and other cytokines.
Cytotoxic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells also are important and can be assessed via levels of antigen-specific induction of perforin,
granzyme B, and granulysin. In addition, IgA and IgG mucosal antibodies have been shown to interfere with the progression
towards disease with other respiratory pathogens and may act similarly against Mtb. The respiratory epithelial cell is a
primary target for mucosal vaccines. A major portion of the mucosa is comprised of cells that can provide a barrier function
and serve as sensors to detect dangerous microbial components through pattern-recognition receptors and transmit signals
to underlying mucosal cells to trigger innate and promote adaptive immune responses. Studies involving several Mtb
secreted proteins including HBHA, Rv3351c and ESAT6 have identified links between the initial interaction of the inhaled
pathogen with alveolar epithelial cells and the subsequent dissemination of the microbes from the lung. These Mtb proteins
also have been shown to generate important immune responses in mice given subcutaneous or intranasal doses.
Nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive mucosal vaccine/immunotherapy delivery vehicles due to the enhanced uptake by
antigen-presenting cells, the preferential draining of NPs to lymphatics rather than to the bloodstream, and depending on
size and composition, the ability of NPs to diffuse through mucus and cross mucosal barriers. Delivery of NP-based vaccines
to the respiratory tract may be a means of enhancing innate immune responses and will be the emphasis of this study. By
combining all three of these epithelial cell-targeting Mtb proteins on a NP vehicle combined with VacSIM® immune-
stimulating matrix plus adjuvant, and deploying as a mucosal booster vaccine to the subcutaneous BCG prime, we expect
protective cellular and humoral responses in animal lungs and significantly-elevated protection from Mtb infection
compared to that conferred by BCG vaccination alone. In Aims 1 and 2, we will evaluate the efficacy and immune responses
for multiple vaccine preparations and identify the two most protective which will be assessed in Aim 3 for safety, stability,
and then protective efficacy will be confirmed in guinea pigs. Our hypothesis is that by stimulating humoral and cellular
immune responses with our Mtb multi-antigen mucosal nanoparticle matrix vaccine, subsequent Mtb aerosol exposure will
result in reduced bacterial replication in the lungs and augment systemic immune responses generated by the BCG-priming
vaccine to more-effectively clear residual bacteria and decrease or prevent dissemination. We are confident this approach
will be successful against Mtb in two different animal models, and thus, lay the groundwork for subsequent non-human
primate trials."
10802347,"Abstract: Autosomal Dominant Hyper IgE Syndrome (AD-HIES) is a rare genetic disease characterized by
elevated IgE, eosinophilia, eczema, recurrent skin infections, and pneumonia. AD-HIES is most frequently
caused by mutations in the STAT3 gene, leading to impaired TH17 cell differentiation and recurrent pulmonary
infections, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in AD-HIES patients. Airway mucus obtained from AD-
HIES patients is abnormally thick (hyperconcentrated), viscous, and adherent. The abnormal mucus properties
are associated with chronic inflammation and mucus obstruction, resembling features observed in cystic
fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In CF and PCD, loss of the CFTR or motile cilia,
respectively, leads to hyperconcentrated mucus, impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC), and chronic infection,
suggesting candidate pathways for the pathogenesis of AD-HIES lung disease. Our preliminary in vitro and in
vivo studies suggest both pathways are defective in AD-HIES: (1) CFTR transcription and function are
downregulated; and (2) expression of ciliary shaft dyneins are also downregulated. These data led us to test
the hypothesis that defective STAT3 perturbs mucus clearance in AD-HIES lungs. Three Aims are
prepared to test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1: STAT3 regulates CFTR-mediated airway surface
hydration and mucus concentration. We will measure nasal PD, sweat chloride values in AD-HIES patients
in vivo, and CFTR activity in vitro using primary AD-HIES human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures at baseline
and after exposure to inflammatory stimuli. Therapeutic approaches aimed to improve CFTR expression and
function will be assessed in AD-HIES HBE cells. Specific Aim 2: STAT3 is required for ciliated cell
genesis, function, and mucociliary transport. We will image motile cilia ultrastructure in freshly collected
nasal scrapes by TEM. Ciliary beat frequency and direction, waveform patterns, regulation of ATP/adenosine
concentrations, and mucus clearance rate in the AD-HIES HBE cells will be measured. Therapies aimed to
restore MCC and mucus hydration will be assessed for their efficacy in AD-HIES HBE cells. Specific Aim 3:
AD-HIES is associated with airway mucus plugging and heterogeneous ventilation that can be
quantified using advanced CT and MRI imaging techniques. To quantify the muco-obstructive phenotype
in AD-HIES patients in vivo, we will perform quantitative imaging analyses by conventional CT, regional ultra-
high resolution CT scan, and high-performance low field MRI to measure mucus plug, airway trapping and gas
exchange distribution. This collaborative project combines the strengths of the NHLBI, NIAID, NIH Clinical
Center, Johns Hopkins CF Center and UNC’s Marsico Lung Institute, to study AD-HIES lung disease. Data
derived from this application should identify the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) of STAT3 in regulating
MCC-mediated innate host defense, optimal imaging modalities for detecting mucus obstruction in AD-HIES
subjects, and novel therapeutic options for restoring mucus clearance in AD-HIES subjects."

This application seeks funds for junior investigators and trainees to attend the biennial Federation of American
Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) Science Research Conferences on the “The Biology and Chemistry
of Vision”. Since its inception in 1985, this has been one of the most successful and influential meetings focused
on photoreceptor biology. The major goal of the meeting is to bring together established and young scientists to
discuss the most recent advances in the broad and diverse fields of photoreceptor biology and pathobiology.
This focused meeting is held in an intimate setting (small conference center with shared meals) for a relatively
small number of researchers (~150) in order to catalyze scientific interchange. The program combines high-
quality, formal presentations of novel experimental results with informal interactions in a friendly, collegial
atmosphere. The meeting also has tremendous educational, career-development and networking value for junior
investigators. Accordingly, the funding requested in this application will be used for covering the travel expenses
and conference fees for the young scientists, including pre- and post-doctoral trainees and junior investigators
at the level of assistant professor. The program emphasizes the most recent, and often most controversial,
research in the field, address timely questions and identifies emerging trends, all of which catalyzes
collaborations for future work. In 2021, the program will include 9 platform sessions, 4 poster sessions, two
DataBlitz presentations, a keynote speaker, and a career development workshop focused on grant writing."
10802294,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Quantitative radiomic analysis of MS based on MRI, performed by extracting imaging correlates of MS
pathophysiology, has been recognized as critical for more accurate and earlier diagnostics, improved precision
in clinical decision-making, and more powerful outcomes in trials for targeted MS therapeutics. Unfortunately,
the application of these approaches in MS are still in their infancy and several challenges unique to MS remain
to be solved before radiomic analyses can be translated in clinical and research practice. A major challenge for
the diagnosis and monitoring of MS is to disentangle the heterogeneity of white matter lesions, both from an
etiologic perspective and in the degree of tissue injury. The presence of confluent clusters of lesions that are
comprised of multiple lesions, particularly around the ventricular horns, poses a key challenge for dissecting this
heterogeneity in lesions: while histopathology shows great phenotypic variability both within and between
lesions, most neuroimaging studies average metrics across lesion clusters losing the valuable information about
each individual lesion. In this proposal, we propose to use advanced statistical analysis of signal intensity from
multi-parametric imaging to distinguish individual lesions and more accurately phenotype them, and thus
facilitate much greater understanding of an individual patients burden of disease and easier application to clinical
practice and research studies.
We will also create tools that will facilitate the adoption of these techniques in the
clinic. We will validate these approaches by comparison to expert neuroradiologist assessments and determine
added value of these techniques.
We further propose to develop a state-of-the-art method for the discovery of
covariate effects in diffuse processes in the normal-appearing white matter and gray matter, which will facilitate
many potential studies of MS pathology and therapeutics. We will also develop software implementations and
educational resources to disseminate the methods developed."
10802418,"Project Summary/Abstract: Platelet transfusion is an important therapeutic intervention for the treatment and
prevention of bleeding. Unfortunately, some patients develop platelet refractoriness (PR), rapidly clearing
transfused donor platelets and preventing the desired therapeutic outcome. Immune-mediated platelet
clearance, attributed to recipient antiplatelet alloantibodies, plays a significant role in PR, and numerous studies
demonstrate alloantibody-induced platelet clearance following transfusion. In the absence of antiplatelet
antibodies, nonimmune causes of clearance can sometimes explain platelet loss. Still, many patients experience
PR in the absence of a clear mechanism, suggesting that other processes of antibody-independent clearance
may occur. Recently, we have found that CD8 T cells possess the ability to cause platelet clearance in the
complete absence of antiplatelet alloantibodies. This finding provides an explanation as to why immune-
mediated PR may be unresponsive to common approaches typically effective at preventing antibody-mediated
platelet loss, and generates additional therapeutic targets for overcoming PR in patients. This proposal details a
five-year research and training plan with a scientific focus on the mechanism by which CD8 T cells mediate
clearance of transfused platelets. The long-term objective of this work is to understand antibody-independent
PR, thereby allowing for optimal transfusion support of thrombocytopenic patients. The specific aims proposed
here use three complementary approaches to understand the interaction between recipient CD8 T cells and
transfused donor platelets. Aim 1 defines the CD8 T cell population responsible for allogeneic platelet loss. Aim
2 interrogates specific receptor-ligand interactions between alloreactive CD8 T cells and platelets. Aim 3
evaluates modifications in platelet glycans resulting from alloreactive CD8 T cell interaction and localizes the site
of platelet clearance. These aims will not only advance our understanding of PR and identify possible therapeutic
targets, but will also afford the additional training necessary for future studies as an independent blood scientist.
A comprehensive mentoring team has been assembled for the completion of both the scientific and career
development goals of this application: primary mentor Dr. Sean Stowell, MD, PhD, an expert in transfusion
medicine and glycobiology research; co-mentor Dr. Rafi Ahmed, PhD, an expert in immunologic memory; co-
mentor Mandy Ford, PhD, an expert in alloreactive T cell responses; and co-mentor Renhao Li, PhD, an expert
in platelet biology. Through completion of the experiments and coursework outlined in this application, the
immediate career development goals to gain basic and advanced training in platelet and CD8 T cell biology, as
well exposure to bioinformatics, bioengineering, and glycobiology, will be attained. In addition, this K99 award
will provide the preliminary data for successful R00 and, eventually, R01-level funding, launching an independent
research career and thereby fulfilling long-term career goals to become a transfusion medicine specialist with an
independently-funded basic science laboratory studying the intersection of hemostasis and adaptive immunity."

10795827,"Older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25% of
hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline, delirium, falls,
behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of stay. Physical activity during
hospitalization (e.g., mobility, bathing, dressing) has a positive impact on older adults including prevention of
functional decline, less pain, less delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased
unplanned hospital readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and
older hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to increasing physical
activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to
walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD;
inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and
prevents falls; and lack of motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and
prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute Care (FFC-AC-
EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is provided by having nurses
teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT
was developed using a social ecological model, social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle.
It involves a four-step approach that includes: (1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2) Education; (3)
Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff, Patients and Families. The purpose of
this study is to test the efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT within 12 hospitals in Maryland and Pennsylvania randomized
to FFC-AC-EIT or Function Focused Care Education Only (EO) with 50 patients recruited per hospital (total
sample 600 patients). Aim 1 will focus on efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity,
function, and participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use of
tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers) along with emergency
room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge; and
at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate
function and physical activity at 6, 12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-
EIT will be compared with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will
evaluate the feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost and cost
savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO. Findings will address several prioritized areas of research: a focus on
ADRD; improving physical function; and training of hospital staff and will demonstrate efficacy of an approach
to care for patients with ADRD that can be disseminated and implemented across all acute care facilities."
10795895,"Project Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a prevalent health risk. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), featured by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, liver injury, and fibrosis, could lead to the occurrence of
cirrhosis and liver cancer, both of which require liver transplantation. Although NASH is reversible, there is no
therapeutics that have been approved by FDA. The pathogenesis for this devastating disease remains poorly
understood. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism underlying NASH pathogenesis and identifying
potential therapeutic targets are of great significance. Liver injury caused by hepatocellular death is a cardinal
feature of NASH and is typically characterized by the presence of ballooned hepatocytes on liver biopsy
examination. In normal liver, hepatocyte apoptosis plays a key role in liver homeostasis, maintaining equilibrium
between hepatocyte loss and replacement. However, pathological conditions including alcoholic or nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis lead to extensive hepatocyte death and liver injury. Numerous studies suggest that hepatocellular
death is the key event triggering the progression of NAFLD and the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which hepatocellular death is controlled may lead to new
treatments for NASH. Metabolic stress, such as overnutrition, is a major pathogenic factor promoting the
development of NASH. However, it is still unclear whether and how metabolic stress directly regulates NASH-
associated liver injury. Our recent study found that the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) senses metabolic stress and controls liver injury in NASH. The repression of AMPK during overnutrition
and obesity promotes NASH-associated liver injury and fibrosis. Moreover, we identified that AMPK directly
phosphorylates zymogen procaspase-6 and prevents its cleavage and activation in livers. Furthermore,
preliminary studies suggest that active caspase-6 cleaves Bcl-2 family protein BID to mediate a feedforward
pathway in the apoptotic caspase cascade. These findings indicate that a novel AMPK-caspase-6-BID axis may
control liver injury and subsequent fibrosis in NASH. We hypothesize that AMPK senses metabolic stress and
controls caspase-6 activation, which in turn mediates NASH-associated liver injury via cleaving BID in
hepatocytes. We will explore this hypothesis with the following aims. Specific Aim 1 will delineate the regulation
and function of caspase-6 in NASH pathophysiology. Using existing and new transgenic mouse models,
including global and conditional knockout mice, we will thoroughly evaluate the role of caspase-6 in the
pathogenesis of NASH, and examine whether BID mediates the deleterious function of caspase-6. Specific Aim
2 will elaborate the molecular mechanism by which the AMPK-caspase-6-BID axis regulates hepatocyte death.
The findings from proposed studies will unravel a novel mechanism underlying NASH-associated liver injury and
identify potential targets for the development of new therapy."
10802353,"Youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) must follow a complex treatment regimen to approximate normal glycemic levels and avoid acute and long-term health complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can improve glycemic control. However, Black and Hispanic youth with T1D have worse glycemic control than White youth and are less likely to use CGM. Disparities in the use of CGM may be one cause of disparities in diabetes health outcomes. Thus, reducing disparities in the use of CGM may be promising approach to reducing health disparities in youth with T1D. The objective of the current proposal is to refine and pilot-test Technology Experts for Equity (Tech-Ex), a technology-enhanced intervention to increase use of CGM among Black and Hispanic youth with T1D. In Tech-Ex, families will work with other families who have experience using CGM (Technology Experts) and also have access to technology supports through the Nemours App. In the Technology Expert components, youth and their caregivers will work with a mentor family to overcome common barriers to CGM use. The Technology Supports will include access to culturally-tailored educational materials, a digital journal to facilitate patient-provider communication around issues with CGM, and SDOH screening and intervention. During the first year of this proposal, we will work with patient, caregiver, and healthcare provider stakeholders to refine the technology coaching program and technology supports, develop plans to deliver the interventions, refine the measurement strategy, and recruit and train mentor families and a care manager. After incorporating stakeholder input, we will test Tech-Ex in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Families will be recruited during or after regularly scheduled clinic visits and randomized (1:1) to Tech-Ex or a 6-month waitlist control. Primary outcomes will be intervention acceptability and feasibility, perceived barriers and facilitators to using CGM, use of CGM, and glycemic control (i.e., HbA1c, time in range). Findings from the current study will inform future research aimed at testing the efficacy of the intervention in a larger, multisite randomized controlled trial."

10794608,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sensory experience facilitates structural and functional maturation of the developing nervous system, and
sensory deprivation severely impairs them. Although the time course for experience-driven sensory development
is specific for each modality, the developing brain acts as a whole. Therefore, sensory perturbation in one
modality results in adaptive reorganization of neural pathways within the unaffected, spared modalities, a
phenomenon known as “crossmodal plasticity.” Although a large body of literature has demonstrated adaptive
crossmodal changes in the auditory cortex (ACtx) during the `classic critical period' (brief developmental period
of enhanced sensory plasticity) after visual deprivation, it is, however, still not known how early in development
crossmodal changes emerge. Based on recent findings that peripheral perturbations can alter ACtx circuits and
function during the first two postnatal weeks of newborn mice (precritical period) and that crossmodal
corticocortical connections are observed between the ACtx and visual cortex (VCtx), we hypothesized that
complete retinal deprivation at birth results in crossmodal functional changes and circuit rearrangement in the
ACtx and VCtx, during the precritical period. We will perform in vivo calcium imaging in unanesthetized mouse
pups during the first two postnatal weeks before and soon after their ears and eyes are open (onset of the critical
period) to assess crossmodal functional changes in the ACtx and VCtx following bilateral enucleation (complete
retinal deprivation) at birth. We will also perform a combination of laser scanning photostimulation and in vitro
whole cell patch clamp recording in slices as well as in vivo extracellular electrophysiology in unanesthetized
pups to assess intra- and inter-cortical circuit changes following bilateral enucleation at birth. Results from the
proposed experiments will provide, for the first time, functional evidence and a thorough assessment of
crossmodal changes in the ACtx and VCtx during the precritical period as a result of complete retinal deprivation
since birth and will provide a clear template to guide investigation of early crossmodal changes in other sensory
pathways (e.g., somatosensory) and in other species during development. Moreover, the results will accentuate
the impact of well-balanced ambient sensory environment in sensory development and will shed light on novel
therapeutic interventions for the recovery of function of deprived senses in infants with sensory disorders, e.g.,
congenital hearing impairment."

10798265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to prevent blindness, either by interfering with disease progression or by developing cell
replacement therapies to restore vision. We believe that microRNAs (miRNAs) are a very powerful and innovative
tool to accomplish this, but we first need to identify the set of miRNAs required for retinal cell fate specification
and proper cell function in the developing retina. These miRNAs might represent potential therapeutic agents to
not only restore imbalances that occur with the onset of retinal disorders, but also to induce specific cell fates for
Müller glia (MG) reprogramming. We therefore propose to investigate the role of retinal progenitor cell (RPC)-
miRNAs for late-stage RPC state and function and MG reprogramming by Aim 1: identifying the specific miRNAs
required in early postnatal development, when rod photoreceptors (PR), bipolar cells (BCs), and MG are
generated. Aim 2: testing miRNAs to reprogram MG into functional retinal neurons with focus on BCs and rod
PR. We propose to use a mouse line that will not be able to produce miRNAs in their RPCs to better understand
the function of miRNAs in retinal development and diseases. We will analyze tissue and cells with regard to
morphological and functional alterations and determine which miRNAs are responsible for changes in cellular
behavior. If we discover certain cell types that do not form properly without miRNAs, this could mean that specific
miRNAs are required for proper development of that cell type. Rescue experiments will show whether disturbed
tissue can be restored by miRNA supplementation and would imply potential therapeutic use. These miRNAs
might also be new, additional reprogramming factors to regenerate specific cell types from stem cells or MG. My
previous work has shown that miRNAs can reprogram MG into neuronal-like cells similar to BCs. However,
whether these reprogrammed neurons are functional, and whether other neurons are generated, is still unknown.
To address these questions, we will reprogram primary MG from reporter mice to visualize the conversion of MG
into RPCs and neuronal-like cells, use patch clamp to measure ion currents, and profile their gene expression.
miRNA candidates that successfully converted MG into functional neurons will be tested subsequently in 3D
organotypic cultures (intact retinas outside the organism). Explants will be treated with miRNAs and evaluated
with regard to cell proliferation and proper differentiation capability. miRNA candidates that can induce MG
reprogramming ex vivo will be utilized for in vivo reprogramming approaches. To reveal underlying mechanisms
and true miRNAs targets, we will use target prediction and target validation tools to narrow down and test
selected candidates via sensors (in vitro proof of miRNA:mRNA prediction) and rescue experiments. This work
provides a comprehensive study of miRNAs by combining molecular and cellular analyses with functional testing,
in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo and will reveal (1) the set miRNAs required for proper retinal development and cell
fate specification of late-born retinal neurons and (2) the set of miRNAs that can reprogram MG into functional
neurons."
10798190,"Project Summary and Abstract
Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is an incurable, uniformly fatal disease involving a point mutation
in a gene called Lamin A (LMNA). Children develop signs of HGPS typically within the two years after birth and
die at a median age of 14, most commonly from progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although
the causal mutation in HGPS was identified 18 years ago, no cures for this disease exist. Programmable base
editing of DNA now enables the previously unprecedented ability to change single nucleotides in DNA and correct
pathogenic mutations with DNA strand breaks. HGPS represents a tractable disease to test base editing,
however it remains completely unknown whether this strategy will improve disease phenotypes associated with
HGPS. As such, there is a critical need to study how DNA base editing alters the molecular defects driving HGPS
in order to determine whether this genome therapy can fulfill its promise to cure disease. Our overall objective
in this proposal is develop adenine base editing (ABE) as a treatment strategy for HGPS. Our central hypothesis
is that ABE-treatment of adult mice can achieve sufficient editing in aortas to reverse vascular pathology through
cell-autonomous effects on survival and clonal proliferation in VSMCs. Our hypothesis is formulated based on
newly published and new preliminary data that demonstrate: 1) scarless correction of the pathogenic mutation
by ABE in patient fibroblasts and in a humanized mouse model of HGPS; 2) prevention of vascular pathology
and recovery of VSMCs at 6 months after ABE treatment of juvenile mice; 3) a significant increase in overall
survival of ABE-treated juvenile animals. The rationale for this project is that validation of base editing therapies
is needed to determine their potential in treating systemic human diseases. To attain our objectives, we will
pursue the following two specific aims: 1) Test whether DNA editing improves vascular pathology in established
disease by treating adult HGPS animals at different ages with a single injection of AAV-ABE; 2) Identify the
mechanism(s) promoting VSMC recovery after ABE treatment. The overall contribution of this work will be to
elucidate how adenine DNA base editing improves phenotypes in HGPS. The central innovation of this proposal
is a conceptual shift in therapeutic treatment of HGPs by focusing on correcting the underlying pathogenic
mutation in cells and tissues."

The long-term objective of this application is to revolutionize the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)
by employing a novel osteogenic hydrogel material in an unprecedented single-stage decompressive
craniectomy (DC) procedure. DC is a common life-saving neurosurgical procedure performed on TBI patients
with either closed head injury and/or stroke. Removing the cranial bone mitigates rising intracranial pressures
by allowing the brain to swell outside the closed calvarial vault. Following the procedure, patients are currently
left with a large cranial defect (i.e., a large hole in their skull) for weeks or months and require a 2nd surgery to
replace the missing cranial bone with their preserved cranial bone or a custom 3D-printed material. In such
cases, this 2nd surgical procedure is currently unavoidable. Our strategy is unique and unprecedented by treating
TBI patients with a single-stage surgical procedure.
 The key to our approach is a new class of hydrogel materials, where natural materials of demineralized bone
matrix, devitalized cartilage, or devitalized tendon are themselves the crosslinkers of the hydrogel. Our material
consists of a paste-like precursor solution of tissue particles and hyaluronic acid that behaves as a paste that a
surgeon can easily sculpt into the open calvarial defect area. With only 2 minutes of UV light exposure the
particles are crosslinked with the hyaluronic acid to create a new material that is solid, yet flexible, and can allow
the brain to swell initially, and then transition into bone as the brain swelling subsides. The innovation of this
material after crosslinking is that it can provide localized relief of swelling by releasing anti-inflammatory
molecules to improve and accelerate neurological recovery, and moreover provide a protective layer between
the scalp and the body’s most indispensable organ. The chief hypothesis is that our flexible, drug-eluting hydrogel
implants placed immediately following TBI and DC in rats will transition to complete bone spanning the cranial
defect and mitigate neurologic deficits associated with TBI. To test this hypothesis, the following Specific Aims
are proposed: 1) Tune hydrogel stiffness and bone regeneration for application to TBI, and 2) Evaluate localized
anti-inflammatory drug delivery after TBI to reduce edema/brain injury volume and thereby to improve behavioral
recovery.
 Our approach is unique in that we are leveraging musculoskeletal regenerative medicine as a tool to usher
in a new paradigm for severe TBI treatment. While a primary debate in the neurosurgery field for treatment of
TBI revolves around the amount of time between the 1st (DC) and 2nd (cranioplasty) procedures, we challenge
whether that debate is even necessary. Instead, we ask whether the 2nd surgery can be eliminated altogether by
introducing a dynamic material as part of the first, and only procedure. In so doing, we hold the potential to
mitigate neurologic deficits associated with severe TBI with an unprecedented single-stage procedure."
10991761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this application is to revolutionize the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)
by employing a novel osteogenic hydrogel material in an unprecedented single-stage decompressive
craniectomy (DC) procedure. DC is a common life-saving neurosurgical procedure performed on TBI patients
with either closed head injury and/or stroke. Removing the cranial bone mitigates rising intracranial pressures
by allowing the brain to swell outside the closed calvarial vault. Following the procedure, patients are currently
left with a large cranial defect (i.e., a large hole in their skull) for weeks or months and require a 2nd surgery to
replace the missing cranial bone with their preserved cranial bone or a custom 3D-printed material. In such
cases, this 2nd surgical procedure is currently unavoidable. Our strategy is unique and unprecedented by treating
TBI patients with a single-stage surgical procedure.
 The key to our approach is a new class of hydrogel materials, where natural materials of demineralized bone
matrix, devitalized cartilage, or devitalized tendon are themselves the crosslinkers of the hydrogel. Our material
consists of a paste-like precursor solution of tissue particles and hyaluronic acid that behaves as a paste that a

10798307,"Biomarkers of food consumption are important indicators for clinical and feeding studies that establish our understanding of nutrition. Carbohydrates make up the largest component of a healthy diet. Biomarkers that are derived directly from carbohydrates are ideal. However, there is a fundamental research gap in that carbohydrate structures of specific foods that are commonly consumed are unknown. The long-term goal is to determine specific glycan biomarkers of dietary intake for all commonly consumed foods. The objective of the current application is to develop a detailed carbohydrate structure library of foods in terms of their monosaccharide and linkage compositions and to evaluate carbohydrate structures for their utility as biomarkers of dietary intake. Our central hypothesis is specific foods have unique carbohydrate structures that can serve as biomarkers of dietary intake. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary studies in which (a) detailed carbohydrate structures have been determined for hundreds of foods and (b) fecal glycans, microbes, and metabolites differed by dietary intervention of weaning foods in infants. Enzymes in the gut from human and their complement microbes are specific to structural carbohydrate features. Therefore, the specific aims are to (1) construct a glycomic library with paired analytical platform for food and feces, (2) conduct a microbial gene marker library using bioreactor studies and (3) test the predictive value of glycan and microbial biomarkers in a human feeding study. The approach is innovative, bringing unprecedented high-resolution carbohydrate content analysis—monosaccharide and linkage analysis of foods—with multiple omic measurements to biomarker prediction of dietary intake. The proposed research is significant and impactful because a high-resolution glycan library of foods together with glycan-microbe biomarker products of those foods will transform future clinical trials in which diet is an essential component."
10932312,"There is no cure for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), and about 1 in 41 men in the United States (U.S.) will die
of the disease. Since African American (AA) men are most likely to be diagnosed with metastatic PCa, the
expansion of research studies that thoroughly evaluate the molecular mechanisms which drive PCa progression
and metastasis leading to lethal outcomes in AA men remains a paramount goal. Metastatic PCa initially
responds to suppression of androgen signaling through androgen deprivation therapy. However, relapse is
inevitable and treatment options are limited. For this reason, a promising area of investigation focuses on
inhibiting androgen-independent signaling pathways—such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)—that promote metastasis. HER2 overexpression is remarkably frequent in PCa tumors and correlates
with worse prognosis and treatment-resistance in PCa patients but has not been evaluated in studies with
sufficient recruitment of HER2 positive patients or in studies inclusive of AA PCa patients or biospecimens. This
research proposal is the first to investigate HER2 by race and evaluate its role in PCa outcome disparities.
Preliminary analysis of RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry of prostate tissue reveals HER2
overexpression in AA PCa patients and suggests a positive correlation with West African ancestry (WAA). We
hypothesize that unique multiomic signatures contribute to HER2 overexpression in AA patients which
worsens clinical features, treatment response, and survival outcomes to be evaluated with these aims:
Aim 1: Confirm that HER2/ERBB2 overexpression is positively correlated with WAA and associated with
worse tumor biology, disease stage, clinical features, treatment response, and survival outcomes. The
effects of HER2/ERBB2 overexpression on cellular function and tumor biology will be evaluated in cells and 3D
cultures. Correlations between HER2 overexpression and disease stage, clinical features, treatment response,
and survival outcomes will be assessed in tumor tissue. All analyses will compare HER2 expression with WAA
calculated using validated ancestry informative markers through single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping.
Aim 2: Identify genetic variations associated with HER2/ERBB2 amplification using liquid biopsy.
Circulating tumor cells isolated from patients with metastatic PCa will be characterized to identify genetic
variations associated with HER2/ERBB2 amplification using single cell genomics.
Aim 3: Determine multiomic signatures associated with HER2/ERBB2 overexpression. Epigenetic,
transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses will be performed in cell lines and sera to identify unique signatures
associated with HER2/ERBB2 overexpression that are predictive of treatment-resistance and poor survival.
Relevance: Thorough evaluation of the molecular mechanisms by which HER2/ERBB2 overexpression steers
PCa progression and treatment-resistance will provide the foundation to pursue future clinical trials with a
precision medicine approach to have a major impact in reducing the higher risk of death in AA men."

Family Diabetes Risk Reduction (Family D-Risk)
 An effective intervention focused on parents and children, designed in collaboration with the
community, may decrease morbidity and mortality associated with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) among
African Americans (AA). The goal of this project is to utilize a community-engaged research (CER)
approach to reduce T2D risk among AA families through the cultural tailoring of the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP). Our long-term goal is to adapt and implement a sustainable, multilevel,
evidence-based program for families at higher risk for T2D. We hypothesize that implementing a
culturally appropriate, family-oriented adaptation of the DPP, Family D-Risk, will result in improvements
in health indicators associated with increased risk for T2D among AA parents and their children. We
seek to achieve the following aims: AIM 1: Utilize a CER approach to culturally tailor a DPP-based
intervention for AA adults at high T2D risk and their children living in low resource rural areas in Albany,
GA. We will conduct focus groups and in-depth interviews with community stakeholders and families to
tailor the Family D-Risk intervention to prioritize both adults and children and better fit the needs of the
AA community in Albany, GA. AIM 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the CER-adapted Family D-Risk
intervention to improve weight, an important T2D risk factor, in AA parents with prediabetes (primary
outcome) and cardiometabolic risk factors in parents and children (secondary outcome) who participate
in the family intervention arm. We propose to implement a two-arm, randomized controlled trial with 140
families to compare: 1) family intervention (family arm) and 2) wait-list control (control arm). AIM 3:
Assess sustainability of the Family D-Risk intervention through evaluation of the local determinants of
mid- and long-term engagement, acceptability, uptake, fidelity, and compliance through measurement
of components critical to program sustainability (i.e., community engagement, acceptability, and
community input on how to sustain the program). If successful, the proposed study will provide
evidence for the utility of using a CER approach to implement a culturally tailored, family-oriented
adaptation of the DPP that will have positive effects on risk factors associated with T2D morbidity and
mortality among AA families in low resource rural communities."

At Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) investigator development continues to be integral to
capacity building in biomedical/behavioral/health disparities research. A diverse group of
institutes, departments, and centers offer a varied pool of investigators requesting support for
both scientific and career development. IDC-supported investigators through rigorous
mentoring, support groups, and grant writing workshops, while executing their research projects.
The IDC received a total of 23 proposals and six 2-year pilots were awarded. The PIs of the
awarded pilot projects regularly communicated with the IDC to report project progress in
biweekly meetings. During COVID-19, the progress of pilot project activities and specifically, the
community-driven pilots was impeded. Changes in social distancing and shifts were also
implemented for lab-based studies. A support group was created for pilot awardees to navigate
their research through the pandemic. In total, the pilot program infrastructure was utilized to
collaborate with other MSM programs to develop, award, and sustain a total of 30 small
research projects (6 CTRHD-funded and 24 non-CTRHD seed grants) and associated
mentoring activities to 36 MSM investigators. MSM continues to employ a strong pool of junior
faculty/scientists who can be targeted for development into biomedical/behavioral researchers in
health disparities. In the RCMI Center for Health Disparities Research’s Investigator
Development Core (IDC), we will implement the following specific aims (SA): SA1: Administer
and employ a rigorous and competitive pilot project program to stimulate new biomedical and
behavioral health disparity (HD) research at MSM; and SA2: Provide mentoring and
professional development support for MSM faculty to develop as biomedical and behavioral
population health HD researchers. The two specific aims are also designed to cultivate the
development of research teams focusing on minority health and associated disparities. Hence,
the success of the IDC will have a huge impact on research capacity at MSM and health
disparities nationwide in both urban and rural communities."

Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability in the US, with the situation in the southeastern states of North Carolina and Virginia being particularly severe. There are significant health disparities in stroke prevalence and stroke care between the Caucasian and non-Caucasian groups in this region. To address the critical need for promising interventions for stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery, and to improve stroke outcomes in under-represented groups, we propose a newly formed Duke-University of North Carolina (UNC) Eastern North Carolina and Southern Virginia RegIonal Stroke TrIal CONsortium (ENVISION) Regional Coordinating Center. The ENVISION RCC will consist of two major academic institutions, Duke and UNC, with 22 regional/community hospitals in eastern North Carolina and southern Virginia (including hospitals with various stroke center designations, pediatric hospital/services, and rehabilitation facilities). In this catchment area, we will draw stroke patients from a population of 4.9 million, predominantly in suburban and rural areas, with a large proportion from groups traditionally under-represented in clinical trials. Both institutions have successful track records in stroke research study recruitment, retention, and follow-up, and are supported by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs). Our Center’s success will build upon strong, existing stroke clinical and research infrastructures and foundations: 1) strong, stroke educational, clinical, and research programs within the Duke- UNC hub; 2) robust patient volumes, pre-existing referring hospital networks, and prior close collaboration; 3) a dedicated, collaborative, multi-disciplinary leadership team [MPIs Drs. Wayne Feng (Duke, Vascular Neurology), Alexander Limkakeng (Duke, Emergency Medicine), and David Hwang (UNC, Neurocritical Care)]; 4) supportive junior faculty training and career development environments; and 5) strong institutional and departmental resource commitments. Through the following aims, we will contribute to the overall success of the NIH StrokeNet clinical trials network: Aim 1. Effectively enroll and retain a diverse population of stroke participants with high protocol adherence and high-quality data integrity with a balanced portfolio of stroke trials; Aim 2. Successfully identify, engage, and train the next generation of stroke scientists; and Aim 3. Actively contribute to the overall success of NIH StrokeNet leadership. As a new RCC, Duke-UNC ENVISION will optimize trial operations and provide high quality studies by leveraging its resources, expertise, experience, productivity, and commitment to inclusivity, thus contributing to StrokeNet goals to reduce stroke burden and improve stroke outcomes and health equity."
10796595,"SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Development of myelin, the lipid sheath formed by fully differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs), is essential for
CNS function and plays a variety of roles in supporting neuronal health and activity. Abnormalities in the
myelin sheath and subsequent neuronal impairment are responsible for the neurologic consequences of white
matter injury (WMI). Upregulation of canonical Wnt activity has been reported in patients with WMI, and
aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is an adverse event for remyelination. However, manipulating Wnt
regulators using genetic models has produced inconsistent outcomes, possibly because these Wnt components
interact with other pathways, affect transcriptional partners at different stages of the OL lineage, and/or have
Wnt-independent functions. Therefore, a critical knowledge gap is the need to understand the temporal
dynamics and molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt signaling at different stages of OL development and after
WMI. Previously, we discovered that the formin protein Daam2 (Dishevelled associated activator of
morphogenesis 2), a component of the Wnt receptor complex, suppresses OL differentiation and yet is also
required for myelination during development. These observations raise an intriguing question: how does
Daam2 play seemingly opposite roles during OL lineage development? Answering this question is essential for
devising novel therapeutic strategies for white matter disorders. To begin to answer this question, we
performed multi-omics profiling and discovered that phosphorylated Daam2 attenuates Wnt signaling in the
OL lineage and promotes OL differentiation while mitigating myelination during development. We also
identified CK2α (Casein kinase II-α) as the kinase that phosphorylates Daam2 and triggers its ubiquitin-
mediated proteolysis by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Trim28 (Tripartite motif-containing 28). Moreover, in WMI
mouse models, both CK2α and Daam2 phosphorylation were found to promote tissue repair. Based on these
compelling preliminary findings, we hypothesize that CK2-induced Daam2 phosphorylation and subsequent
degradation is a key post-translational mechanism that attenuates Wnt signaling and promotes remyelination
after injury. To address this hypothesis, we will first determine how Daam2 phosphorylation by CK2α
contributes to Wnt signaling during OL development and after WMI (Aim 1). Second, we will determine the
mechanisms of Daam2 phosphorylation-induced degradation during OL development and after WMI (Aim 2).
Upon completion, these studies will decipher the crucial role of Daam2 and its post-translational regulation in
the stage-specific OL lineage. Our findings will deliver clinically applicable insights into regulatory pathways,
potentially filling a critical unmet need for patients with WMI."
10799561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of leukemia in adults. New therapeutic strategies are
urgently needed for AML, as the overall five-year survival rate remains at less than 25 percent. Agents that
activate the CARD8 inflammasome were recently discovered to trigger a non-inflammatory form of lytic cell death
in hematopoietic cells, including AML cancer cells, and thus have potential to become new anti-AML drugs.
Currently, the only pharmacological agents known to activate the CARD8 inflammasome are small molecule
inhibitors of serine proteases DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9). Unfortunately, DPP8/9 inhibitors also activate the
related NLRP1 inflammasome, which, unlike the CARD8 inflammasome, triggers a highly inflammatory form of
cell death in other cell types and thereby limits the therapeutic window of DPP8/9 inhibitors for the treatment of
AML. The central hypothesis of this application is that the differences between NLRP1 and CARD8 can be
exploited to develop selective CARD8 inflammasome activators. The preliminary data produced in the applicant’s
laboratory and described in this application show that inhibitors of the enzyme PEPD selectively activate the
CARD8 inflammasome and kill AML cancer cells without simultaneously activating the NLRP1 inflammasome.
The objective of this application is to develop PEPD inhibitors as new therapeutic agents for the treatment of
AML. This project consists of three specific aims: 1) to optimize potent and selective PEPD inhibitors; 2) to
determine the mechanism of action of PEPD inhibitors for selective activation of CARD8 in AML cells; and 3) to
explore the therapeutic potential of PEPD inhibitors in mouse models of AML. Successful completion of these
aims will identify and characterize the first agents that selectively activate the CARD8 inflammasome, and obtain
preclinical proof of concept for the utility of such agents in treating AML. Overall, this work has high potential
to not only reveal fundamental mechanisms that regulate inflammasome activation, but also to harness
inflammasome activation for therapeutic benefit against cancer."
10799563,"Adolescent relationship victimization (ARV), characterized by physical, sexual, cyber or psychological abuse,
reproductive coercion, or sexual exploitation, remains highly prevalent despite implementation of evidence-
based interventions in schools and community settings. Negative outcomes, including suboptimal academic
achievement, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, disordered eating, suicidality, and homicide, result in
significant costs to individuals and society. The emergency department (ED) offers unique opportunities to
promote healthy relationships and mitigate negative impact of ARV among an at-risk adolescent population.
However, current ED-based relationship interventions are limited by 1) disclosure-based delivery, 2)
addressing limited forms of abuse, 3) limited efficacy, and 4) missed opportunities to provide point-of-care
harm reduction resources. The Healthcare Education Assessment and Response for Adolescent Relationships
(HEART) intervention may address these concerns through 1) universal delivery of education and counseling,
and 2) comprehensively addressing the full range of ARV. Previous study by Dr. Miller (co-mentor)
demonstrated efficacy of HEART to decrease ARV. However, HEART requires adaptation for the ED setting,
given significant contextual differences between the ED and the originally intended setting, school health
centers. Dr. Randell, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and candidate for this career development
award, is committed to a patient oriented clinical research career targeting interventions to promote healthy
adolescent relationships. Her five-year career development plan includes structured mentoring and formal
didactics to address critical gaps in her training through acquisition of expertise in theories of behavior change,
clinical trials for adolescent behavioral research, implementation science, and adolescent research ethics. The
proposed study complements other training activities by enabling hands-on experience in intervention
adaptation and a randomized control trial. Following identification of enhancements necessary for HEART in
the ED setting, Dr. Randell will conduct a randomized controlled trial to enable evaluation of eight feasibility
constructs. The hypothesis is that HEART in the ED will be feasible as defined by primary outcomes of
acceptability and efficacy to decrease ARV. The rationale is that this study will produce the first ED-based
intervention to utilize universal education to comprehensively address ARV in conjunction with provision of
point-of-care harm reduction resources. Study findings will inform the development of a larger hybrid efficacy-
implementation study, supported by an R01 submission during the K23 award period. This training and
research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department
of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus recommendations for
addressing public health problems in the ED setting."
10799564,"Summary
The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of serial amnioinfusions, a novel fetal
therapy for early pregnancy renal anhydramios (EPRA). EPRA occurs in more than 1 in 2000 pregnancies and
affects 1500 families in the U.S annually. EPRA has previously been considered universally fatal due to its
associated pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal respiratory failure. More recently, preliminary data from case
reports have demonstrated an association between serial amnioinfusion therapy and short-term postnatal
survival in EPRA fetuses, with excellent respiratory function in the neonatal period. Furthermore, long-term
survival has been observed in a few cases, largely due to advances in neonatal dialysis and the advent of safe
living donor kidney transplantation in toddlers. Serial amnioinfusions for the management of EPRA have been
implemented in clinical practice, but no systematic and prospective study evaluating this treatment has
occurred. Therefore, there is a lack of generalizable knowledge about the maternal/fetal safety, feasibility and
short- and long-term clinical outcomes of this intervention. This proposal to study Renal Anhydramnios Fetal
Therapy (RAFT) consists of a multi-center, non-randomized prospective trial to address the following specific
aims: (1) To determine the maternal and fetal safety and feasibility of serial amnioinfusions for EPRA
(2) To examine the short-term efficacy of RAFT and (3) To determine the long-term efficacy of RAFT on
survival and quality of life. A consortium of 8 advanced fetal centers will operate under a single institutional
review board with one protocol that has strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each center has been selected
based on long experience and expertise in advanced fetal therapy and neonatal dialysis. This pilot trial will also
seek to elucidate the mechanism of RAFT by capturing radiologic and amniotic fluid biomarkers during therapy.
Furthermore, it will permit the first prospective analysis of the in utero natural history of EPRA by rigorously
tracking patients who do not terminate their EPRA pregnancy but do not wish to undergo serial amnioinfusions.
The RAFT trial not only has the potential to improve our understanding of the effect of serial amnioinfusions on
lung growth in EPRA but also on other fetal diseases that impair lung function. Furthermore, serial
amnioinfusions in EPRA pregnancies and serial acquisition of amniotic fluid biomarkers along with assessment
of radiologic biomarkers may shed new light on the mechanisms of normal lung development. Most
importantly, this trial will provide crucial data to assist families in making decisions about fetal therapy for
fetuses affected by EPRA, making incremental progress toward the goal of health from birth for all children."
10799571,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide and lung cancer in never smokers is still
among the top fatal cancers. Approximately 25% of lung cancers are driven by mutationally activated KRAS. A
major obstacle in treating lung cancer is resistance to current therapeutic treatments. Recently, the first inhibitor
of KRASG12C, sotorasib, was approved by the FDA for a subset of patients with KRASG12C driven lung cancer but
primary and acquired resistance is arising. Currently, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of how
KRASG12C driven lung cancer cells survive after treatment with targeted therapy and how to overcome
this. It is known that cancer cells can upregulate autophagy signaling, a nutrient scavenger pathway, in response
to cellular stresses such as targeted therapy. Previous work has highlighted the impact of genetic silencing of
essential autophagy genes Atg5 and Atg7 in KRAS driven lung cancer. We seek to test the impact of
pharmacological inhibition of KRASG12C and its downstream signaling effectors on autophagy signaling and lung
tumorigenesis in KRASG12C driven lung cancer models. We hypothesize that KRASG12C driven lung cancer cells
increase autophagic flux after treatment with KRASG12C inhibitors and co-treatment with selective autophagy
inhibitors will lead to superior delayed tumor growth. About 30% of lung cancer patients with KRAS mutations
also have a deletions or inactivating mutations in LKB1, a protein involved in regulation of nutrient sensing and
autophagy. KRAS-mutant lung cancer patients with loss of LKB1 expression are characterized by an aggressive
behavior and resistance to standard treatment. In other KRAS-driven cancers, the LKB1-AMPK-ULK1 signaling
axis is the proposed mechanism as to how autophagic flux increases following KRAS pathway inhibition.
Preliminary data suggests LKB1 is dispensable for increases in autophagy flux after KRASG12C inhibition in KRAS
mutant lung cancer cells with loss of LKB1 expression. We seek to test if LKB1 is necessary for autophagy
signaling in KRASG12C driven lung cancer and if the ULK1/2 kinases activates autophagy independently of LKB1.
To test this, we will use a novel murine model of KRASG12C driven lung cancer (KrasG12C-LSL) and human cell line
models. Results accumulated from the study will lead to further findings that in turn will improve the health of
lung cancer patients, including expanding the average life span after diagnosis."

Elastic fibers provide the elasticity that is essential for the function of many organs/tissues, such as lung, large
arteries, and skin. Congenital deficiency or destruction/degradation of elastic fibers can lead to emphysema,
arterial aneurysm, and laxity of tissues. Reversely, excessive formation of elastic fibers is a feature of
pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, which is currently without any effective treatment. Many proteins are
modified after they are produced in cells. Such modification can critically influence the function of proteins. One
such modification is citrullination, which has been shown to regulate the function of various types of cells.
Aberrant citrullination has been observed in many human diseases, such as chronic obstructive lung disease,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, manipulating protein citrullination can be
beneficial in many clinical settings. This project is based on a novel observation that citrullination critically
regulates the formation of elastic fibers. Its goal is to investigate the role and mechanism of action of
citrullination in regulating the formation of elastic fibers and lung function. Molecular, cellular, and biophysical
approaches will be deployed to elucidate how citrullination regulates the elastogenesis of fibroblasts (Aim 1)
and how citrullination of critical elastogenic proteins is regulated (Aim 2). Reagents detecting the citrullination
of the critical elastogenic proteins will be developed to facilitate this endeavor. Finally, genetically engineered
mice will be generated to examine cell type-specific and temporal roles of citrullination in modulating the
function of lungs and the development of emphysema induced by cigarette smoking (Aim 3). Knowledge
gained from this project very likely will uncover novel therapeutic approaches toward many human diseases,
such as emphysema and arterial aneurysm."
10799717,"Project Summary/Abstract
In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the lack of data sources for non-European populations results in
polygenic risk predictions that could exacerbate health inequity. This racial/ethnic disparity problem exists in
many epidemiologic studies and impacts public health much more broadly. Furthermore, the rapid identification
of novel risk factors for complex diseases brings increasing opportunities to develop comprehensive risk
prediction models to combine information on genetic and other types of risk factors. The scientific goal of this
proposal is to provide enhanced disease risk prediction tools for ethnically diverse populations integrating genetic
and other data sources across disparate studies. The specific aims include: (Aim 1) develop enhanced multi-
ethnic genetic risk prediction models combining ancestry-specific GWAS summary statistics with external
genomic information, and extend the method to jointly analyze multiple related diseases; (Aim 2) develop a
flexible statistical framework that can integrate ancestry-specific, summary-level risk parameter estimates for
genetic markers and a variety of other risk factors to further improve multi-ethnic disease risk prediction; and
(Aim 3) develop and validate the risk prediction models for leading causes of mortality and other complex
traits/diseases, distribute user-friendly software and tools, and investigate their clinical utilization through
applications in precision medicine.
Dr. Jin’s long-term goal is to establish an interdisciplinary research program that combines statistical genetics,
functional genomics and epidemiology, and develop novel statistical and computational methodologies for
integrating multi-source health-related data to improve healthcare and reduce health inequities. This award will
facilitate the necessary training required for Jin’s successful transition to independence, including support from
the mentoring and advisory committee, advanced coursework, and active participation in collaborations,
workshops, and scientific conferences. Jin will gain expertise that complements her current skill set through
working closely with a highly multidisciplinary mentoring team with a combined expertise in statistical genetics,
genomics, epidemiology, and precision medicine. Johns Hopkins University provides young researchers with an
active and engaging intellectual environment, with tremendous opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations
and career development services such as teaching institute, grant writing workshops and interview skills practice.
The research supported by this grant will generate enhanced, user-friendly disease risk prediction tools for the
underrepresented minority populations, as well as general data integration methodologies that can be widely
implemented by the community to accelerate future research in disease risk prediction and prevention. Upon
completing this award, Jin will gain a critical set of skills in research, mentoring, communication and management
that will ensure her success in establishing an independent research program and pursuing broader career goals."

Intra-tumor heterogeneity is a significant barrier to precision oncology. Emerging single-cell and spatial profiling
approaches have enabled basic research into tumor heterogeneity. However, the application of these
emerging approaches to the clinical decision process is limited. There is a critical need for predictive models
that integrate these novel data with existing genomics approaches and histology, to generate actionable
clinical recommendations. This proposal builds on my lab’s recent work, using single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) to map the cellular hierarchies of complex tumors. Our preliminary data extend these studies to
single-cell multi-omics, integrating single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) and
spatial transcriptomics (ST). Our long-term goal is to develop models of malignant progression based on
sequencing data from patient biopsies and deploy them to support clinical decisions. The overall objective of
this project is to develop algorithms to integrate heterogeneous single-cell and imaging data to support therapy
selection, trained on data from multiple cancers and broadly applicable pan-cancer. The rationale for this work
is that these algorithms will be applied to pre-treatment biopsies to predict progression and to recommend
appropriate therapy combinations. In Aim 1 we will develop and validate algorithms to model clonal
composition, phylogeny, and evolutionary trajectory. This will be used to rigorously identify combinatorial
chemotherapy targets and monitor emerging treatment-resistant clones. In Aim 2, we integrate scRNA-seq with
ST as training data to develop a predictive model of gene expression and cellular composition, based on
imaging data alone. We validate these algorithms internally, on prospective cohorts, and in situ in adjacent
tissue. In Aim 3, we develop predictive models of two clinical problems that are challenging in many cancers:
1) the response to ionizing radiation, 2) the emergence of hypermutation at recurrence. Here, we exploit
modern deep-and-wide learning approaches to identify genomic predictors of outcome that are tailored to a
patient’s clinical context. We will validate this approach using both internal and external controls. Algorithms
will be implemented in clinician dashboards in an existing system and the evaluation of clinical support will take
place at two sites: the University of California, San Francisco and the University of Pittsburgh. We anticipate
that this project will identify novel prognostic signatures, enable risk stratification, disease monitoring, and the
selection of precision therapies. These studies will significantly advance our ability to apply single-cell and
spatial profiling in the clinical setting."

sequencing data from patient biopsies and deploy them to support clinical decisions. The overall objective of
this project is to develop algorithms to integrate heterogeneous single-cell and imaging data to support therapy
selection, trained on data from multiple cancers and broadly applicable pan-cancer. The rationale for this work
is that these algorithms will be applied to pre-treatment biopsies to predict progression and to recommend
appropriate therapy combinations. In Aim 1 we will develop and validate algorithms to model clonal
composition, phylogeny, and evolutionary trajectory. This will be used to rigorously identify combinatorial
chemotherapy targets and monitor emerging treatment-resistant clones. In Aim 2, we integrate scRNA-seq with
ST as training data to develop a predictive model of gene expression and cellular composition, based on
imaging data alone. We validate these algorithms internally, on prospective cohorts, and in situ in adjacent
tissue. In Aim 3, we develop predictive models of two clinical problems that are challenging in many cancers:
1) the response to ionizing radiation, 2) the emergence of hypermutation at recurrence. Here, we exploit
modern deep-and-wide learning approaches to identify genomic predictors of outcome that are tailored to a
patient’s clinical context. We will validate this approach using both internal and external controls. Algorithms
will be implemented in clinician dashboards in an existing system and the evaluation of clinical support will take
place at two sites: the University of California, San Francisco and the University of Pittsburgh. We anticipate
that this project will identify novel prognostic signatures, enable risk stratification, disease monitoring, and the
selection of precision therapies. These studies will significantly advance our ability to apply single-cell and
spatial profiling in the clinical setting."

Title: Lipidomics and structural genomics of cardiometabolic health in Samoan adults
Project Period: 09/01/2023–08/31/2027
Pacific Islanders, such as Samoans, are disproportionally burdened by cardiometabolic disease yet are un-
derrepresented as participants in health research generally, and in genomics research specifically. In this project
we will expand the knowledge of lipidomic and genetic structural variation present in Samoans to understand the
relationships between the lipidome, simple nucleotide variation, structural genetic, modifiable risk factors, and
cardiometabolic health. In our first aim, we will determine associations between comprehensive serum lipid pro-
files and both simple nucleotide variation and cardiometabolic traits in 4,300 Samoan adults from Samoa and
American Samoa. To achieve this, we will first generate comprehensive lipidomic data, then characterize asso-
ciations between the lipidome, modifiable risk factors, and cardiometabolic phenotypes, conduct lipidome-wide
association studies of known genetic determinants of lipid variation, and perform genome-wide association stud-
ies of the lipidome. In our second aim, we will evaluate associations between structural genetic variation and
both comprehensive lipid profiles and cardiometabolic phenotypes by calling structural variation in 1,285 se-
quenced Samoan adults, imputing that variation into the larger set of the aforementioned 4,300 Samoan adults,
examining associations between structural variation near known genetic determinants of lipidome and cardi-
ometabolic variation, and examining associations between genome-wide structural variation and the lipidome
and cardiometabolic phenotypes. In our third aim, we will conduct exploratory integrative analyses to identify
systems-level patterns among the layers of information available and gathered in the first two aims. Finally, in
our fourth aim, we will propose and lead collaborative investigations of our findings with collaborators among the
TOPMed Program. our active participation with the Program will enlarge the range of multi-ancestry analyses
possible among the participating studies and broaden the impact of this work beyond Samoa. Our discoveries
will improve our understanding of the basic biology of lipids and downstream cardiometabolic health outcomes,
as well as identify potential targets for interventions to improve cardiometabolic health."
10799055,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Skin-penetrating nematodes, including the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis, infect nearly
one billion people worldwide and are a major source of morbidity in low-resource settings. Infections can cause
chronic gastrointestinal distress, stunted growth and cognitive impairment in children, and even death in the case
of S. stercoralis infection. Skin-penetrating nematodes have a soil-dwelling infective third-larval stage that
actively searches for a host to infect using host-emitted sensory cues, and then invades the host by penetrating
directly through the host’s skin. Host invasion via skin penetration is an essential step of the parasitic life cycle,
yet remarkably little is known about this process. We propose to investigate the behavioral, neural, and molecular
mechanisms that mediate skin penetration in S. stercoralis and the closely related rat parasite Strongyloides
ratti. We will leverage new methods we recently adapted for mechanistic studies of these species, including
methods for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis, reversible chemogenetic neuronal silencing, and in
vivo calcium imaging. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the behavioral program that leads to skin penetration using in
vitro and ex vivo skin-penetration assays. We will compare the behaviors of S. stercoralis and S. ratti infective
larvae on host vs. non-host skin to identify behavioral sequences specific to host skin. We will also compare the
responses of infective larvae vs. non-infective life stages to identify behaviors that are specific to infective larvae.
Finally, we will compare the behaviors of S. stercoralis and S. ratti infective larvae to those of distantly related
skin-penetrating infective larvae, passively ingested infective larvae, and free-living larvae to gain insight into the
evolution of skin-penetration behavior. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of dopamine signaling in regulating
skin-penetration behavior. We will test the hypothesis that the Strongyloides dopaminergic neurons are
mechanosensory neurons that detect the texture of the skin surface and initiate skin-penetration behavior upon
contact with host skin. We will also functionally characterize the response properties of the dopaminergic neurons
upon contact with host skin. In Aim 3, we will identify and functionally characterize the mechanosensory neurons
and mechanotransduction pathways that recognize specific mechanical features of host skin and enable the
infective larvae to burrow through the skin. We will also compare mechanosensory function in Strongyloides spp.
and the free-living nematode C. elegans to pinpoint the specific mechanosensory adaptations of the parasites
that support skin penetration. Together, our results will provide key insights into the molecular and neural
mechanisms by which skin-penetrating nematodes invade hosts, which may inform the development of novel
topical anthelmintics."

Germline pathogenic mutations and common variants have been implicated in the development of clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Similarly, recurrent somatic alterations are key to ccRCC pathogenesis and
distinct clinical states. Combinations of germline and somatic mutations can directly interact to disrupt the same
gene in ccRCC, traditionally exemplified by biallelic pathogenic coding mutations in VHL. Novel combinations of
different genes and alteration types in germline and somatic genomes may also contribute to pathogenesis and
clinical states (“convergence”); however, studying these relationships remains a major challenge for the cancer
genetics field. For example, the expanding scope of germline and somatic events in noncoding regions, most of
which have uncertain functional impact, significantly complicates discovery of genes that dysregulate convergent
biological processes. Additionally, whether related germline and somatic events promote tumor heterogeneity,
which may also impact clinical outcomes, is largely unknown and historically difficult to study given the lack of
appropriate methodologies and cohorts. Finally, certain germline and somatic alteration types (e.g. structural
variants) remain poorly understood in ccRCC, but determination of their impact on actionable genes is necessary
to maximize precision oncology approaches. Our team has developed strategies to overcome these significant
challenges, and our subsequent preliminary findings indicate that ccRCC exhibits previously unappreciated
forms of convergence. These include combinations of germline and somatic events that: (i) alter transcriptional
states of biologically related genes through noncoding variation; (ii) impact chromatin regulatory complexes to
result in clinically relevant histologic heterogeneity; and (iii) indirectly disrupt actionable genes through novel
structural mechanisms. Broadly, hypothesis-driven investigations of these unconventional germline and somatic
relationships may inform how they promote ccRCC pathogenesis, unique histopathologic states, and distinct
clinical outcomes. Building on our extensive preliminary data and longstanding expertise in computational and
functional cancer genomics, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that novel biologically convergent
germline and somatic alterations contribute to ccRCC pathogenesis, and these convergent properties jointly
shape tumor heterogeneity and clinical states. We will evaluate this hypothesis through the following independent
Specific Aims: 1) Determine the convergent germline and somatic noncoding events that contribute to
oncogenesis; 2) Define the germline and somatic alterations that jointly influence clinically relevant spatial
heterogeneity; and 3) Dissect the clinical actionability of germline and somatic structural variants in inclusive
cohorts. This hypothesis-driven proposal will reveal relationships between germline and somatic events, tumor
heterogeneity, and clinical actionability in ccRCC via a suite of innovative cross-disciplinary approaches. Overall,
this proposal will enable a new understanding of how germline and somatic genomes jointly shape tumor initiation
and evolution in ccRCC, and potentially across cancers."

Multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests, which evaluate cell-free DNA and other biological components with a single
blood draw, are a new frontier in cancer screening, particularly for cancers with no effective screening methods.
Despite commercial availability, little is known about their feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness across
diverse settings and populations. To address this evidence gap, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is creating
the Cancer Screening Research Network (CSRN) to conduct rigorous, multicenter cancer screening studies. In
response to RFA-CA-23-020, we propose a CSRN ACCrual, Enrollment, and Screening Site (ACCESS) Hub
that will recruit participants for the initial Vanguard study from Kaiser Permanente (KP) across 21
sociodemographically diverse medical centers in urban, suburban, and semi-rural areas of California that include
~1.45 million adults ages 45-70 years and that can efficiently expand, for follow-up CSRN studies, to 36 medical
centers with ~3 million screening-eligible adults. Our underlying population for the Vanguard study includes large
numbers of Asian or Pacific Islander (311,959), Black (100,910), and Hispanic (285,287) adults covered by
Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance, allowing for oversampling and inclusion of underrepresented
groups. Efficiently linked by administrative and clinical data systems within an integrated health care system, the
KP ACCESS Hub is well-suited to achieve the CSRN’s goals. Our setting provides comprehensive primary and
specialty care with continuous longitudinal tracking of healthcare utilization, including standard of care cancer
screening; has low loss to follow-up due to health plan disenrollment; and captures complete real-time
information on patient encounters, referrals, diagnoses, procedures, test results, treatments, and outcomes in
extensive electronic health record data systems, including laboratory, pathology, radiology, and cancer registry
databases. The KP ACCESS Hub will be led by a multidisciplinary team embedded within KP clinical operations
and research structures. The team has decades of clinical, scientific, and implementation expertise in cancer
screening and proven experience with recruiting participants for large-volume trials, data management, and
specimen collection, including the use of oversampling and other strategies for optimizing participant diversity
and engagement. Drawing on these collective strengths, our specific aims are to: (1) Recruit, enroll, retain, and
follow a sociodemographically diverse sample of 2,400 asymptomatic, average-risk adults ages 45-70 years,
including understanding barriers to participation for underrepresented groups; (2) Develop and assess processes
to effectively communicate MCD test results to participants and providers; (3) Identify and evaluate diagnostic
pathways following a positive MCD test for timely follow-up care; and (4) Collect and transfer high-quality data
and specimens from study recruitment through closeout for all needed endpoints. In close collaboration with the
Coordinating and Communication Center, Statistics and Data Management Center, other ACCESS Hubs, and
the NCI, the KP ACCESS Hub can inform the evaluation of MCD tests across diverse populations."

The aims of the parent R37 grant were (1) to develop and refine a mobile sensing system that
applies machine learning to smartphone and wearable sensor data to passively detect symptom
burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this
system in an academic oncology clinic. Since the start of the R37 award on July 1, 2019, we have
enrolled 154 (77% of our target n = 200) patients into a 90-day study assessing daily and weekly
symptoms and continuous behavioral sensing via wearable device and smartphone during
chemotherapy, conducted interim analyses demonstrating that next-day overall symptom
burden can be predicted from passive sensor data, and developed infrastructure to deploy
symptom prediction models in real-time.
The next logical step for the original R37 research is to integrate sensor- and machine learning-
based predictions into a patient-centered digital health intervention to personalize supportive
cancer care. The two-year extension will enable us to design and develop a web application that
shares real-time symptom predictions with patients and uses them to trigger personalized
symptom management instructions. To provide useful recommendations, we also need to
develop prediction models that can predict specific, clinically significant and actionable
symptoms rather than overall symptom burden. In addition, we need to determine the best way
to share machine learning-based predictions and recommendations in a way that fosters trust
and that supports patient autonomy as well as patient-provider communication. The R37
extension will enable us to address two new aims: (1) develop additional machine learning
models to predict specific clinically meaningful and actionable symptoms and (2) design and
develop a web application that integrates these predictions and uses them to inform real-time
symptom management.
This work falls well within the scope of the parent grant and represents continued refinement of
both the clinical utility of our machine learning models as well as our integration of these
models into supportive cancer care within an academic oncology clinic."

Immunotherapies for cancer, including Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT), chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T cell therapy, and Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB), have seen great clinical
success. However, they are still limited by cost, variable efficacy and resistance, and lack of
quality targets. Technologies to track immune responses, and in particular tumor-specific T cell
responses, would help researchers and clinicians to better understand variable responses in
patients, design better targets for therapies, and track patient health outcomes. In this proposal,
we aim to adapt our novel hydrogel-based immune cell expansion system to detect and
characterize rare, neo-epitope specific T cells in the peripheral blood. This platform, termed the
artificial T cell stimulation matrix (aTM), is a hyaluronic acid hydrogel conjugated with signals 1
(peptide-MHC), 2 (anti-CD28) and 3 (cytokine support). In order to create an aTM-based high-
throughput detection system, we will first investigate the effects of physical (i.e. stiffness) and
biochemical (i.e. activation molecules and cytokines) cues of the aTM on the expansion of neo-
epitope specific anti-tumor T cells in mice. We will test the optimized aTM for batched expansion
from bulk murine splenocytes in order to create a high-throughput system. Next, we will develop
a process to detect and expand tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells from peripheral blood
of healthy donors and compare this to current gold standards of antigen-specific T cell
detection. Finally, because disease status may impact our ability to detect rare T cells, we will
verify that the system can be used for detection of neoepitope-specific T cells from the
peripheral blood of melanoma patients. Access to blood from patients will also allow us to
determine how ICB treatment affects the immune response to the tumor by investigation of
expanded neo-epitope specific T cell phenotype and function before and after therapy. The
development of aTM as a high-throughput detection system for neo-epitope, patient-specific T
cell responses will allow pre-clinical and clinical researchers to study immune responses to
cancer and to improve cancer immunotherapies by bringing the power of these therapies to
more patients."
10931589,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a frequently devastating psychiatric illness that is challenging to diagnose and treat. In
our prior work, we have shown that metabolism, function, and morphology of the cerebellum is different in
participants with BD as compared to controls. Furthermore, we have observed a relationship between mood
and cerebellar metabolism as well as function in a cross-sectional design. These findings support the growing
body of literature that the cerebellum is involved with BD. However, there has been a sparsity of studies
undertaken that have attempted to follow participants with BD and observe changes in brain metabolism and
function associated with fluctuations in mood. We are proposing to conduct a two-year longitudinal study of
170 participants with a diagnosis of BD type I as well as 90 matched controls to study changes in cerebellar
metabolism and function associated with mood fluctuations. The participants with BD will receive a brief weekly
mood assessment to identify changes in mood where subjects will be assessed using neuroimaging. Brain
imaging will include metabolic, functional, and anatomical imaging with the data used address the following
aims. Aim 1) Does cerebellar metabolism change with mood in BD? We hypothesize that the cerebellum plays
a significant role in maintaining the euthymic mood state (i.e. plays a compensatory role) and when the
cerebellum is no longer able to serve this compensatory role depressive or manic mood states develop. To test
this hypothesis, we will assess changes in cerebellar metabolism (31P, 1H MRS, and T1ρ) associated with
mood changes. Aim 2) Does cerebellar function and connectivity vary with mood in BD? To test the function of
the cerebellar vermis, we plan to perform two task-based fMRI studies (backward masking emotional faces and
go/no-go). In addition, resting state functional connectivity will allow us to explore connectivity of the
cerebellum with the emotional control network. We hypothesize that connectivity between the vermis and
nodes of the emotional control network will vary with mood state and expect increased connectivity in the
euthymic state and decreased connectivity during exaggerated mood states (depression/mania). Furthermore,
we expect that as mood ratings for depression and mania increase subjects with BD will exhibit a greater
number of incorrect responses and failure to activate the cerebellum. These results would provide further
evidence that the cerebellum is playing a compensatory role to maintain mood. In addition, this study may
provide information leading to novel therapy trials in the future."

Influenza viruses induce significant morbidity and mortality in the human population every year. Despite the
medical importance of influenza disease, the mechanisms underlying the viral pathogenesis are incompletely
understood. After influenza viruses initiate infection, cellular pattern recognition receptors detect components of
the virus and inflammatory cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN) are produced. While an important part of
early control of viral replication and spread, excessive or prolonged IFN signaling is associated with
immunopathology and more severe viral disease. We have previously shown that some respiratory epithelial
cells can survive direct viral infection, display prolonged IFN signaling, and contribute to lung immunopathology
likely by delaying epithelial regeneration. Thus, understanding how type I IFN is downregulated represents a
critical aspect of influenza disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, however, we failed to detect a difference in any
of the canonical IFN induction or suppression pathways in the cells that survived direct viral infection. We
therefore hypothesized that there must be additional regulators of IFN signaling relevant for IFN control
during the resolution of influenza virus-induced disease. By leveraging genome wide CRISPR activation
screening approaches, we were able to identify a previously uncharacterized regulator of IFN signaling (the ETS-
family transcription factor ETV7) which upon induction, non-uniformly suppressed the expression of individual
interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). The major goal of this application is to define this novel, ETV7 mediated, IFN
regulatory mechanism and understand its physiological importance during influenza viral disease in vivo. In Aim
1, we will perform high-throughput biochemical analysis of ETV7 binding across all ISG promoters and then
define how intrinsic ETV7 affinities for primary promoter sequences affect transcription factor competition. This
work will reveal the first regulatory pathway capable of differential suppression of individual ISGs. In Aim 2, we
will focus on understanding the cell type-specific importance of ETV7 regulation during respiratory epithelial
innate immune responses and tissue regeneration after infection. These experiments will establish a new
mechanism for how the balance between the antiviral signaling and regenerative capability in the lung is
maintained. Finally, in Aim 3, we will explore how dysregulation of ETS-family transcription factors affects viral
pathogenesis and recovery from infection in vivo. Successful completion of these studies will increase our
understanding of the mechanisms that regulate IFN signaling during influenza virus infection and potentially
inform new interventions to limit the severity of viral disease."

Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium which is often triggered by a viral infection. Despite
the use of supportive measures and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, mortality still exceeds
10% at one year, and lasting complications in survivors (e.g., persistent dilated cardiomyopathy) are not
uncommon. No specific treatment for acute myocarditis has been validated. Immunosuppressive drugs have had
anecdotal success, but overall survival is not improved. Myocarditis is characterized by robust innate and
adaptive immune responses that increase proinflammatory cytokines and recruit activated immune cells (e.g.,
neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells) to the myocardium. But not all immune cells are harmful:
regulatory T cells (Tregs) favor tissue repair and functional recovery. In particular, the subset of CD4+Foxp3+
Tregs has the potential to mitigate injury via release of inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IL-10), growth factors (e.g.
TGFβ), or contact-dependent effects. Such a conjecture is bolstered by several early phase clinical trials showing
that autologous Treg cell infusion is safe and promising, in diseases ranging from Type 1 diabetes to solid organ
transplant rejection. However, the very long processing times (weeks to months) required for ex vivo expansion
render autologous Treg cell therapy implausible for acute myocarditis. For all these reasons, a therapy which
can selectively and quickly expand Tregs in vivo is highly desirable. Our previous studies demonstrated that
extracellular vesicles secreted by human cardiosphere-derived cells (CDC-EVs) increase proliferation of mouse
Tregs and augment their production of IL-10, which, in turn, induces cardioprotection in vivo. We have also found
that CDC-EVs increase Tregs, and improve heart function, in rodent models of myocarditis. However, the
mechanism underlying CDC-EV-enhanced proliferation and activation of Treg cells is unknown. In preliminary
data, we show that a CDC-EV-enriched long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), BCYRN1, upregulates Treg cells in vitro:
proliferation and migration are enhanced, and the Tregs become activated to secrete IL-10. Here we propose to
dissect the mechanism whereby BCYRN1 upregulates Tregs, and to characterize the disease-modifying
bioactivity of BCYRN1 in experimental myocarditis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to advance the
development of a novel RNA-based approach targeting regulatory T cell function as an effective therapy for
acute myocarditis. Using multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches, this goal will be achieved in 3 specific Aims:
(Aim 1): Explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying BCYRN1-mediated human Treg cell proliferation,
migration, and IL-10 production. (Aim 2): Synthesize the functional miR-binding sequences of BCYRN1, and test
their effects on Treg cell proliferation, migration, and IL-10 production in vitro. (Aim 3): Test in vivo the therapeutic
potential of BCYRN1 and BDSS in a mouse model of acute myocarditis. Thus, we will address both mechanistic
and translationally-motivated questions, using state-of-the-art scientific methods and preclinical disease models."

Title: REGULATION OF CERAMIDE SYNTHASE BY PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION
Abstract:
 Ceramides form the backbone of all sphingolipids, and ceramide synthases (CerS) are critical enzymes
for de novo production of ceramides. In spite of the key role of CerS in ceramide generation, there is a serious
deficiency in understanding how these enzymes are regulated. The long-term goal of this project is to uncover
and understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how CerS enzymes are regulated. Using a
proteomics approach, we discovered that the small heat shock protein Hsp27 interacts specifically with CerS1.
Based on our preliminary data we generated the novel hypothesis that Hsp27 is a negative regulator of CerS1
activity via direct interaction that can be modulated by p38-MK2 MAPK mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27, and
that down-regulation of Hsp27 induces CerS1/C18:0-ceramide mediated cellular responses. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define the biochemical significance of Hsp27
mediated CerS1 regulation in cells with respect to sphingolipid metabolism and signal transduction. Aim 2: Define
the biological significance of Hsp27 mediated CerS1 regulation. Aim 3: Determine the mechanism of Hsp27-
CerS1 protein-protein interaction. Overall, these studies will establish Hsp27 as an endogenous modulator of
CerS1 and uncover a novel mechanism of how Hsp27 regulates CerS1 and CerS1/C18:0-ceramide governed
mitophagy and cancer cell death. The knowledge generated from this study will help design mechanism-based
novel therapies against cancer and other pathologies in which C18:0-ceramide is the key mediator by identifying
new methods to modulate CerS1 activity."

 Without T cells (e.g., CD4+ helper, CD8+ cytotoxic), mammals cannot have a proper functioning immune
system or fight off viral infection. Classically, T cells in mammals develop in the thymus then migrate to
peripheral tissues and circulate in the blood. Development of T cells is critical for mounting antiviral response
cytokines, immune memory, regulation, pathogen recognition, activation of B-cells to produce antibodies, and
cytotoxic response to virus-infected cells. Bats are able to suppress the most highly pathogenic viruses found
in mammals (e.g., SARS, Ebola, Rabies, and Nipah) with little to no clinical symptoms or pathology acting as
the main reservoir. Yet after 100 years of anatomical study little is known about T cell development,
abundance, expression, or T-cell receptors (TCRs) repertoire within bats. Studies of bat T cell development
and responses in bats have largely been understudied due to lack of immunological reagents such as
antibodies specific for bats.
 In this resubmission, our research team has provided preliminary data using x-ray computed
tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry that bats have thymus with T cells present. We also provide
evidence of age related thymus involution within adult big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). In our proposal, we
will use museum voucher specimens and collect wild bats to further develop methods for structural and
molecular approaches to study lymphoid organs and T cell development.
 Our team has decades of experience in mammalogy, viral-host interaction, adaptive immune system
sequencing (VDJseq), and viral immunology. We will provide ultrastructural determination of the bat’s thymus,
spleen, lymph ducts, and bone marrow that will include development of antibodies for flow cytometry/FACS or
mRNA based in situ hybridization flow cytometry (Flow-FISH), single molecule fluorescence mRNA in situ
hybridization (mRNA-smFISH) and immunohistochemistry (which we have preliminary data) that will elucidate
the lymphoid organs of T cell development (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will assess T cell development in bat primary
and secondary lymphoid organs across developmental age (juveniles, subadults, and adults) and examine
sexual dimorphism, using bulk organ RNAseq, single cell RNAseq, and RT-ddPCR. Using VDJseq/TCRseq we
will measure the TCR repertoire diversity across lymphoid tissues and blood (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will access
and link thymic involution to the susceptibility of bats to pathogenic viruses.
 Our proposal and team is uniquely posed to provide a new path towards unraveling the ‘black box’ of
bat T cell adaptive immune responses. This is foundational work that will enable further immunological study in
bats and other small mammals but provide a groundwork to new immunotherapies, vaccines, antivirals, or
anti-inflammatory drugs."
10788841,"Microbial keratitis (MK) is a serious ophthalmic infection that can cause visual impairment and even blindness. The MK
infection is commonly treated by the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin or combination therapy
including tobramycin and vancomycin or gentamycin and vancomycin. The frequency of drop instillation for severe
infections is every 5 min for the first 30 min followed by half-hourly drops or hourly drops for the first 24-72 hours including
night. Subsequently, the frequency decreases to once every 2 or 4 hours. The high instillation frequency is required because
of rapid eye drop clearance resulting in a low bioavailability of 1-5%. The total number of drops for this therapy could be
as high as about 100 over 1-week of treatment. While efficacious, the patients have difficulties in complying with this high
frequency application of eye drops resulting in poor prognosis. We will address this unmet need by designing a novel
sustained release contact lens drug delivery system for delivering antibiotics (moxifloxacin (monotherapy) and tobramycin
and vancomycin (combination therapy)) to treat MK. Contacts lenses offer many advantages over eye drops including
extended release that will improve compliance by replacing 100 drops with 1-2 lenses and higher bioavailability that will
lead to higher and more consistent concentrations in ocular tissues resulting in improved therapy and reducing the possibility
of development of resistance that is becoming a major problem. We have developed a novel, patented approach for extended
delivery by incorporation of vitamin E (a tocopherol) nanobarriers in commercial silicone hydrogel contact lenses. Use of
commercial contact lenses that are already approved by the FDA reduces barriers to translation. Our preliminary results
have shown that nanobarrier contact lenses (NB-CL) increase the drug release duration of moxifloxacin, while maintaining
all key properties of the contact lenses including transparency, wettability, UV-blocking, oxygen and ion permeability, low
protein binding, and young’s modulus. Specifically, we showed that incorporation of 20% (w/w) on dry basis of vitamin E
in Acuvue Oasys lenses increases the release duration of moxifloxacin from a few hours to about 50 hours. Also, validated
mathematical model suggests that an Oasys lens loaded with 30% VE and 500 µg of moxifloxacin will result in drug
concentrations in aqueous humor comparable to the tedious drop regimen of numerous drops over 3 days. This research
aims to manufacture and characterize the antibiotic-loaded nanobarrier lenses in Aim 1 and test pharmacokinetics and
efficacy in New Zealand white rabbits in Aim 2. The approach will provide insights into sustained drug delivery and
efficacy with acute wear NB-CL, and lead to a novel device to treat MK. Our approach promises to increase bioavailability,
reduce dosage amount to improve compliance and minimize drug variations to reduce the potential for development of
antibiotic-resistance. If successful, NB-CL for sustained drug delivery will revolutionize MK treatment by replacing about
100 drops with 1-2 contact lenses. The approach is applicable to other drugs individually or in combination for many other
indications including other infections, glaucoma, wound-healing, inflammation, cystinosis, etc. The validated model will
establish the fundamental design principles and serve as an optimization tool."

 The nervous system of social species has evolved to perceive and evaluate signals within a social
context. Social information therefore must impact how the brain processes information, yet little is
still known about how the brain integrates social information to produce actions in a social context.
This lack of knowledge exists in part because social context is difficult to quantify and because the
majority of studies are performed in species that do not have a particularly rich social structure. Here
we propose to study the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), a highly gregarious songbird
species whose social behavior has been well studied and where vocal and non-vocal communication
signals form a central and critical component of its social system.
 We have created a “smart aviary” equipped with cameras and microphones that is capable of
monitoring behavior in each individual during the entire breeding season. Our aim is to create a fully
automated system using computer vision and machine learning technology to evaluate moment-to-
moment behavioral interactions between all member of the group (9 females and 7 males) over the
entire breeding season. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of engineers, neurobiologists
and computational scientists, to create a platform where we can record

from images using artificial neural networks and a 3D articulated mesh model. By collecting
output of the model over consecutive frames we will obtain a pose trajectory, which we will
and classify into discrete behaviora l types. We also aim to develop a miniature non-
wirelessly powered and transmitting recording device optimized for long duration recording
our aviary that critically does not impact bird individual or social behavior. Such a device would
 us to link neural activation patterns to discrete behavioral events (e.g. male song) within the
context in which these specific events occurred. Supplied with our rich dataset, we aim to
mathematical tools necessary to generate social network models that will allow us to

heterogeneity is found across the distinct capillary beds in multiple different organs and tissue types. These
capillary beds are the central functional unit of the circulatory system and serve as the sites for gas exchange,
filtration, hormone secretion, and immune cell trafficking. Each capillary bed is uniquely tuned to its organ-
specific function. For example, endothelial cells in liver capillaries are highly fenestrated and allow large
macromolecules to traverse their boundaries, while brain capillaries exhibit highly selective barrier function to
prevent toxic plasma components from damaging neurons. In this latter case, the function of these blood brain
barrier (BBB) capillaries is governed in part by vascular mural cells known as pericytes, which share a
basement membrane with endothelial cells. In the absence of pericytes, BBB function is lost, leading to
leakage, deficits in neurovascular flow, and eventual neuronal apoptosis. Accordingly, recent observations
indicate that pericyte loss may be a precipitating event in a number of neurodegenerative disease. Thus,
pericytes play an essential role in regulating organ-specific function of capillary beds in the circulatory system.
Despite their importance for vascular homeostasis, nothing is known about how pericyte identity is specified
and maintained during embryonic development, in contrast to most other cardiovascular cell types. By
leveraging our expertise using the zebrafish as a model system to investigate vascular development, we have
applied an integrated single cell molecular approach to identify candidate transcriptional networks that may be
responsible for establishing pericyte identity. Through this approach we have identified the first pericyte-
specific enhancer elements, including those that display organ specificity, along with cognate transcription
factors responsible for their expression. Our proposed studies will combine cutting edge genetic approaches,
along with integrated cell and molecular lineage tracing, to define both general and organotypic transcriptional
regulatory programs responsible for pericyte identity. Taken together, our results will shed major new insights
into how this important cell type develops during embryogenesis."

This proposal directly addresses, in a uniquely innovative and direct approach, the stated goal of FAO PAR-19-
250: To better understand “exposure of the older person to changing environmental hazards in their daily
environment that raises their risks”. Men and women over the age of 65 are the most vulnerable population
during severe environmental heat events. While we know a lot about age-related declines in physiological
responses to environmental heat stress, there are key critical gaps in our understanding of the impact of
extreme weather on aging human populations as well as in ways to positively intervene. The present project
adds practical information: 1) by determining the integrated thermoregulatory response of men and women
over the age of 65 yrs to a wide variety of adverse environments and 2) by identifying the specific
environments that have significant adverse impact on older adults. The research approach will yield directly
translatable results that can be used for evidence-based alert communication, policy decisions, triage for
impending heat events, and implementation of other safety interventions. We will test the global hypothesis
that aging will shift critical environmental limits to a narrower range of safe environments across the
psychometric spectrum (encompassing warm-humid to hot-dry environments). The present proposal logically
builds on our 30-year body of mechanistic research on thermoregulation and aging and our experience in
executing this unique research paradigm. In Specific Aim 1 we propose to identify those environmental limits
above which age-related physiological changes cause uncompensable heat stress, resulting in heat storage
and increasing the risk of heat illness. As appropriate based on the data, distinct psychrometric limits will be
derived for older men and older women. We hypothesize that aging will decrease critical environmental heat
balance limits, particularly in warm-dry environments due to impairments in sweating mechanisms. In Specific
Aim 2 we will calculate critical evaporative coefficients and wet-bulb globe temperature isotherms that can be
used to predict environmental conditions that are uncompensable, and therefore increase health risks for older
men and women. These coefficients can subsequently be used to predict responses of older adults to a wider
set of environmental parameters (solar load, wind, etc.). Finally, we propose one additional exploratory Aim.
Our laboratory has identified additional detrimental effects of over-the-counter and commonly prescribed
platelet inhibitors on thermoregulation in older men and women. We have previously described how aspirin
(ASA) and prescription platelet inhibitors (clopidogrel; Plavix®) further accelerate the rise in body core
temperature in warm environmental conditions and impairs heat loss mechanisms. Therefore, we propose to
also determine the effects of ASA on age-specific critical environmental limits, hypothesizing that these drugs
will further decrease the critical environmental heat balance limits, particularly in hot humid conditions due to
impairments in dry heat loss mechanisms (Specific Aim 3)."

 The ten-eleven translocation family (TET1/2/3) of enzymes are epigenetic regulators of gene expression
that are highly expressed in neural stem cells (NSCs) and during mammalian nervous system development. TET
enzymes are dioxygenases that promote active and passive DNA demethylation by converting 5-methylcytosine
(5mC) into 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) and higher-order oxidized derivatives. In addition to its role as a
demethylation intermediate, 5hmC can function as a stable epigenetic mark and is highly enriched and dynamic
in the developing nervous system. TET enzymes and 5hmC dysregulation have been implicated in human
neurodevelopmental syndromes, intellectual disability, craniofacial abnormalities, and neurodegeneration.
These observations suggest a critical role for TET enzymes in the developing nervous system and has led to
interest in their roles in the biology of NSCs. However, the functions of TET enzymes in NSCs and
neurodevelopment remain poorly understood. Preliminary data from our lab demonstrates that Tet triple-
knockout NSCs (T123–/–) derived from embryonic stem cells exhibit severe defects in self-renewal, multipotency,
and expression of neurodevelopmental genes. We therefore hypothesize that TET enzymes have essential
functions in epigenetic regulation of gene expression programs critical for NSC maintenance and multipotency
and in embryonic neurodevelopment. To test this hypothesis, we have derived embryonic forebrain NSC lines
containing floxed alleles of Tet1/2/3 and a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase transgene expressed from the
constitutive Rosa26 locus (T123F/F; +/R26-CreER) for conditional, combined deletion of all three Tet genes. We
have also established a colony of Tet1/2/3 triple-floxed mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase
transgene under control of the neural-specific Nestin promoter (T123F/F; +/Nestin-CreERT2). Using these models,
we will (1) define the role of TET enzymes in the maintenance and multipotency of NSCs , (2) establish the
requirement of TETs in embryonic neurodevelopment, and (3) identify TET-mediated epigenetic and
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in NSCs. Findings from these studies will define novel roles played by
TET enzymes in NSC biology and neurodevelopment, provide insights into how dysregulation of TETs contribute
to human neurodevelopmental disorders, and identify novel targets for therapy. Under the joint mentorship of
Drs. Meelad Dawlaty and Jean Hébert, I will successfully execute the proposed research and training plan. This
research program will further my knowledge of the epigenetic regulation of neural stem cell biology and facilitate
my scientific and professional development by equipping me with the necessary skills to become a physician-
scientist."

Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a cluster of symptoms associated with
immunotherapy that did not show up in pre-clinical studies but has been found in 40-90% of the people
undergoing immunotherapy as part of cancer treatment. The purpose of ICANS detection and prompt
treatment is to halt ICANS progression and minimize the risk of brain edema and herniation, the most feared
sequelae of ICANS resulting in severe cognitive symptoms, coma, ICU stay, intubation, and potentially death.
Current standard-of-care approaches to monitoring for ICANS consist of a brief neurocognitive assessment
resulting in an immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score indicative of the severity of
cognitive impairment. However, recent work shows that there is an opportunity to detect ICANS at an earlier
stage than is currently possible with ICE by monitoring for subtle early changes in speech and language such
as decreased fluency and coherence, word finding difficulties, and increased repetitiveness of speech. We
have developed a Stress, Affect, Language and Speech Analysis (SALSA) system designed to administer and
analyze speech-based neurocognitive tests over the telephone. SALSA conducts a conversation with the
patient and scores the audio received from the patient for several markers of speech fluency, verbal fluency
and working memory deficits. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate an end-to-end AI-based solution for
high intensity but low patient and provider burden neurocognitive screening for early manifestations of ICANS
based on the SALSA platform. The short-term objective of the proposed study is to examine the feasibility,
safety and ability of SALSA to detect ICANS with specificity and sensitivity equal or better than standard of
care in a prospective clinical study."

Despite multimodal treatment, cancer-related mortality in pediatric brain cancers remains high and survivors
often suffer from serious, life-long, therapy-related side effects and secondary malignancies. There is a clear
need for more effective therapies, including for the most common malignant pediatric brain cancer medullo-
blastoma, a tumor that originates in the cerebellum. Mechanosensitive signaling pathways have emerged as
powerful targets in cancer drug discovery, including for the treatment of medulloblastoma. Yet, when targeting
signaling pathways that serve as sensors for a tumor cell's microenvironment, traditional monolayer cultures that
are most commonly used in cell-based high-throughput drug discovery, do not accurately recapitulate critical
environmental cues such as tissue stiffness or extracellular matrix composition. Drug discovery aimed at key
mediators of mechanosensitive signaling require cell-based screening assays in a cell culture environment that
more closely resembles in vivo tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have moved to the forefront in the
effort to create more in vivo-like experimental environments that can mimic intricate cell-cell and cell-extracellular
matrix interactions found in tissue. Our previous collaborative work demonstrated the suitability of the self-
assembling and hydrogelating MAX8 β-hairpin peptide as a 3D cell culture scaffold for automated high-
throughput drug discovery. We demonstrated that MAX8 combines biocompatibility and tunability in function and
stiffness with unique mechanical properties (e.g., shear-thinning, injectable solid with immediate rehealing) that
allow automatic handling with standard high-throughput screening (HTS) liquid handling equipment commonly
found in a drug discovery laboratory. The primary objective of this proposal is to use the versatile and tunable
MAX8 peptide to develop a 3D cell culture scaffold that mimics key features of brain extracellular matrix while
also retaining material properties critical for use with automated liquid handling equipment, all for a high-
throughput drug discovery approach targeting mechanosignaling. Aim 1 will establish a targeted assay for a well-
characterized mechanosensitive signaling pathway that is compatible with MAX8 peptide hydrogel scaffold-
based 3D cell cultures in a high throughput-compatible setup. Aim 2 will examine how tuning hydrogel stiffness
and peptide functionalization with brain extracellular matrix components affects assay performance and
phenotype of cerebellar neurons and pediatric brain cancer cells. Aim 3 will validate the newly developed assay
platform by performing a pilot drug screen and in vivo efficacy testing of candidate compounds. The outcome of
these studies will be a 3D cell culture platform that will provide fundamental understanding of how extracellular
matrix composition and tissue stiffness regulate mechanosignaling in both normal neurons and pediatric brain
cancer cells. Additionally, these studies will lay the foundation for a future high-throughput drug discovery
approach targeting mechanosignaling in scaffold-based 3D cultures optimized for pediatric brain tumors."
10794382,"Value-based decision-making, driven by each individual’s own appraisal of available offers, is an indispensable
part of our lives and a key determinant of mental health. Internalizing disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety),
commonly feature maladaptive decision-making characterized by the assignment of erroneously low value to
rewarding activities and objects. Elucidating the neural basis of value-based decision-making is thus crucial for
understanding adaptive behavior and may provide translational insights. The lateral habenula (LHb) is thought
to act as the brain’s “bad news” center by broadcasting signals that decrease the value of rewards and is
implicated in depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, LHb is known to receive strong inputs from the
raphe nuclei, the brain’s source of serotonin, a neuromodulator that is the target of most pharmaceuticals for
internalizing disorders and many other psychopathologies. The dorsal raphe (DR), the largest serotonergic
nucleus, is known to be involved in value-related processes, though the role of its inputs to LHb is unclear. In
particular, despite its potential importance, little is known about how the primate raphe-LHb circuit mediates the
complex strategies we use every day to choose activities and objects, a decision-making process which
requires integration across many reward attributes, such as amount, risk, and delay. We hypothesize that
LHb plays a central role in integrating attributes in order to compute the value of offers and guide
decisions online, using delay-related signals from DR to discount value. Aim 1 investigates the role of
LHb in multi-attribute decision-making. LHb signals are proposed to reflect preference integrated across the
many attributes that may define a reward and are ultimately broadcast to cortex and the basal ganglia, regions
with a prominent role in selecting actions. Preliminary data suggest that neurons in LHb integrate reward
attributes in a manner consistent with negative subjective value and that increasing LHb firing with weak
electrical stimulation during an offer’s presentation biases choice away from that offer in a manner consistent
with decreased offer value. Aim 2 investigates the role of DR multi-attribute decision-making. DR is proposed
to signal variables related to time delays until reward. If this is true in the context of decision-making, DR could
send delay and related attributes to LHb to guide decisions. Disruptions in this circuit could then interfere with
evaluation and choice of multi-attribute offers, and amelioration of such disruptions by antidepressants could
contribute to their therapeutic effects. Subsequent experiments will test the hypothesis that the sensitivity of
LHb and choice preference to reward delay is controlled by DR. These Aims will clarify the role of the primate
raphe-LHb circuit in multi-attribute decision-making, laying the groundwork for my future investigations of the
behavioral and neural systems that underlie internalizing and related disorders and undoubtedly opening the
door to new therapeutic avenues. Through these Aims, I will acquire the skills needed to successfully drive this
research as I develop into an independent psychiatrist-neuroscientist."
10932378,"With the majority of Americans supporting legalization of medical cannabis, the number of patients asking their
clinicians about medical cannabis has also significantly increased. Many clinicians, however, feel that they
have inadequate knowledge about the efficacy, side effects, and abuse potential of medical cannabis. One
national survey of oncologists reported that only 30% felt sufficiently informed to make recommendations
regarding medical cannabis use, even though 80% regularly conducted conversations about medical cannabis
with patients. A study from Washington State found 21% of patients with cancer surveyed had used cannabis
in the past month. Despite the common belief among many patients that herbal therapies such as cannabis are
inherently safe, the evidence is growing that greater caution is needed with cannabis as it may have potential
direct side effects and may lead to interactions between herbs such as cannabis and medications. Thus, an
important knowledge gap exists regarding the use of cannabis by patients with cancer during active cancer
treatment, and this prospective cohort study is proposed to address these questions. This study aims to assess
the prevalence and patterns of cannabis use among patients with cancers of the lung and multiple myeloma
during active treatment as well as inquire about the communication patterns regarding cannabis use with their
treating medical team. In order to reduce the complex variables that exist between the types of cancers and
treatments, we will study two unique cancer populations – non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and multiple
myeloma (MM), with each cohort studied separately. These patients provide a homogenous population of
patients with cancer that have generally standardized treatment regimens. Cancer patients currently receive
platinum-based chemotherapy either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) receiving surgery together with a
PD-1 inhibitor (a type of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), ex. nivolumab). Newly diagnosed MM patients are
recommended to receive induction therapy with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd) for three
to six months followed by an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). These two cohorts provide unique
opportunities to study the impact of cannabis use in both a solid tumor and hematologic cancer during
chemotherapy. For the NSCLC cohort, we will also assess the effect of cannabis on immunotherapy efficacy.
For the MM cohort, we will assess the effects of cannabis during ASCT. Concurrently, we will survey oncology
healthcare providers about their perceptions, education, and practice patterns regarding cannabis use by
patients. Data collection will include information about all the medications including prescription, over-the-
counter, herbs, and supplements in order to assess for the prevalence of potential medication interactions with
cannabis. We hypothesize that a substantial proportion of patients receiving cancer treatment are using
cannabis (~20%) and that there are different patterns of cannabis related benefits and harms based on cancer
type and treatment as well as patient demographics including socioeconomic factors."
10795073,"ABSTRACT (ADMIN CORE)
The Center proposal “A platform for cell type-level transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial interrogation of
Alzheimer’s disease” proposal aims to combine expertise in AD pathology with expertise in new single cell
molecular technologies to generate a new high resolution cellular and molecular understanding of the early
pathogenesis of AD. The Center consists of three Research Projects, focusing on neuropathology,
transcriptomics and epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics; a Data Core, and an Administrative Core with
seven PIs and three collaborative sites. Realizing the potential of this Center requires strong administrative
leadership to integrate and synergize efforts across the collaborating researchers at the University of
Washington, Kaiser/Group Health and the Allen Institute for Brain Science.
The Administrative Core will provide the structure, leadership and operational management of the Center
towards achievement of the overall Center goals to understand the cellular and molecular basis of the early
pathogenesis of AD. This will include project management, strategic planning, progress reporting, fiscal
management, and support for collaboration and communication. The Administrative Core will create an
infrastructure that fosters communication and collaboration among the Center members, as well as garnering
input from the external AD research community through the formation of an External Scientific Advisory
committee. The Center will form a Steering Committee and Project Teams to oversee the collaborative,
standardized, and on-time data generation, data analysis, and public data sharing process. Project management
best practices, such as milestones, progress reporting and tracking, collaborative software programs, and a
responsibility matrix will be applied to the Center to ensure achievement of performance objectives and
milestones, optimized communication, and resource utilization and prioritization. In addition, the Core will foster
joint data analysis efforts across projects and Institutions, including joint Analysis Working Groups and
hackathons. Further, the Administrative Core will support the implementation of standard operating procedures
and quality control standards for data generation, data processing, and analysis. To produce a high-quality data
resource for high resolution neuropathological and omics analysis of Alzheimer’s disease, rigorous
standardization and quality control practices will be adopted by all members. Finally, the Administrative Core will
implement and maintain fiscal and subcontractor management processes for all members, manage publication
and authorship decisions and conflict resolution. With the implementation of this entire infrastructure, we
anticipate that this project and the resources it produces will have a broad and meaningful impact on gaining a
deep molecular and cellular understanding of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and progression."
10795074,"ABSTRACT (DATA CORE)
 The Allen Institute has demonstrated a tradition of excellence by creating data frameworks to support the
dissemination of biological data and analysis tools for the research community. The Allen Brain Atlas data portal
(http://www.brain-map.org) is a comprehensive data navigation platform, containing gene expression, brain
connectivity, reference atlases and characterization of in vitro and in vivo neuronal cells from multiple species,
including human, mouse and non-human primate. The AD Data Core will build on this foundation, to provide
centralized data integration and presentation solutions for large-scale data sets derived from the AD Center
consortium. The AD Data Core will also form partnerships with other centers and user groups, to maximize
impact of the rich data being generated through the AD cell characterization projects.
 New tools for detailed molecular and spatial analysis of single cells are revolutionizing our understanding
of the brain, but the power of emerging techniques has not yet been applied to characterize neuropathology in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This proposal aims to address this gap by using transcriptomic, epigenetic and
multiplex molecular spatial analysis methods to characterize AD pathology at the level of cell types. A centralized
and managed approach to collecting, storing, processing, annotating, analyzing and sharing the data is essential.
Successful integration will yield a foundational data set depicting a molecular profile of AD, and the AD Data
Core will serve results to the community via a catalytic open web portal. The AD Data Core will also leverage
methods being developed by major single cell profiling initiatives, to benefit AD research. The Allen Institute for
Brain Science, NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) have funded
complementary efforts to characterize nonpathological brain at the cellular level, including a Brain Cell Data
Center (BCDC), which the AD Data Center proposal is designed to synergize with. The expertise and
methodological tools required to build the BCDC have been developed by many members of the team proposed
for the AD Data Core. Utilization of an existing, rigorous collaborative effort offers great economy to the process
of building out an “arm” of cellular profiling capability for AD. Best practices that have been developed for
maximizing data usability can now be brought to AD research with this project. Synergy with these cell profiling
initiatives offers opportunity to accelerate AD research progress by leveraging content from other cell-centirc
databases and corresponding analysis methods. The proposed AD Data Core will also be an end-to-end
platform that can accommodate future scale, such as growth of patient cohorts, new data modalities, and
additional clinical dimensions of AD or related cognitive disorders. Finally, the AD Core will engage with clinical
and research communities through accessible web-based tools for data navigation, and dissemination of
information through outreach approaches such as forums, hackathons and informational narratives."

The underlying goal of Project 1 is to facilitate an integrated neuropathological approach incorporating
traditional and quantitative pathology techniques with cell-type and molecular profiling to develop a unique
resource to promote next generation AD research. It leverages existing collaborative relationships between
UW Neuropathology and the UW ADRC and Kaiser Adult Changes in Thought studies for research autopsies.
Project 1 will implement newly developed protocols for modernized autopsy sampling and preservation of brain
tissue that are amenable to state-of-the-art cell type and molecular profiling techniques (Aim 1), as planned in
Projects 2 and 3. Deceased subjects from both studies with short post-mortem intervals will enter Project 1
tissue pipeline to ensure high quality tissue preservation and availability for -omics Projects, with appropriate
quality control measures at each step. Each ACT and ADRC autopsy includes qualitative neuropathological
examination with extensive sampling and a battery of immunostains specific to pathologic peptides according
to the latest guidelines. Neuropathological data from each case will be reviewed at regular meetings with
Project 1 investigators; cases along the spectrum of AD pathology, but lacking co-morbid neuropathologies,
will be promoted to eligibility for inclusion in Aim 2 and the Projects 2 and 3 pipelines. Aim 2 expands analysis
of selected cases to include all regions of interest for Projects 2 and 3, but also regions of relevance to current
AD cognitive subtypes and biomarker studies with a battery of immunohistochemical stains, image analysis,
and quantitative assays to characterize neurodegeneration (pathologic peptides), neurotoxicity (neurons,
synaptic markers, stains for white matter and oxidative stress), and reactivity (astrocytes, microglia,
inflammation). In Aim 3, results from cell-type and molecular profiling studies in Projects 2 and 3 will be
prioritized for targets identified in early AD pathogenesis, validated, and extended to the broader autopsy
cohort to determine relevance. Quantitative measures for these analyses may include Luminex-based
immunoassays and other techniques proteins and metabolites of neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity, and
neuroinflammation/gliosis in regions and subjects of interest. We predict, based on the last five years,
approximately 30 cases per year that are eligible for inclusion in Aim 2 and Project 2 and 3 pipelines. Each
brain that goes through Project 1 pipeline, even if not selected for inclusion in the -omics components of the
Center, will be preserved according to these novel protocols and deeply characterized for future studies of AD

10795077,"ABSTRACT (PROJECT 2)
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly penetrant neurodegenerative disease projected to affect 13.8 million
cases in the US by 2050 at a cost of $1.1 trillion if no treatment is developed. AD is characterized by stereotyped
progressive neurodegeneration and accumulation of two misfolded proteins in brain regions important for
cognition and memory. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau follow a progression like
neurodegeneration, while extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques are initially detected in cortical and deep brain
structures. It is unclear whether these pathologies are causal or effects of other underlying processes and
currently no anti-tau or anti- Aβ therapies stop or reverse AD. Gene expression studies of AD have largely been
performed on tissue or cell populations, and impact of neuronal loss and gliosis on these results is unknown.
Epigenetic modifications are also associated with AD, though methylation studies have produced conflicting
results and no clear pattern of epigenetic dysregulation associated directly with AD progression has emerged.
 The present study adapts recently developed high-throughput, single-cell methods for transcriptomic and
epigenetic analysis to the identify molecular and gene regulatory hallmarks of “clinically typical” AD without
significant co-morbidities. Building off a detailed understanding of neurotypical adult cell types, the project aims
to identify transcriptional changes in specific cell types or classes correlated with increasing severity of AD
pathology in different brain regions affected by the disease, and then identify gene and chromatin accessibility
changes with pathology in vulnerable cell populations. This project will initially optimize single nucleus RNA-seq
and epigenetics methods for use with postmortem samples of varying pathology and tissue quality, and generate
reference datasets for brain regions to be analyzed in AD. Low-cost, droplet-based single nucleus RNA-seq will
then be used to classify and characterize cell types in regions differentially affected by tau and amyloid pathology
from many donors spanning AD progression with quantified tau and Aβ pathologies. A broader set of brain
regions will then be surveyed on a subset of cases with consistent AD-related phenotypes to understand whether
there is a common AD signature across brain regions, and whether signatures of AD can be detected prior to
the emergence of neuropathology. Finally, higher-resolution methods will target transcriptomic and epigenetic
changes in AD associated with pathology and disease diagnosis in specific cell types, aimed at achieving a
mechanistic understanding of AD phenotypes. Using this design, this project can directly probe dysregulated
gene networks within affected cell types for the first time, providing a potential causal link between genetic or
epigenetic states and resulting gene expression. The resulting datasets and platform will produce valuable
insights into the cellular and molecular basis of AD and will be made publicly accessible through the Data Core."
10795679,"Project Summary
 Hypertensive and ischemic heart diseases are the two most important risk factors of heart failure. In
response to elevated blood pressure, the heart manifests hypertrophic growth to ameliorate ventricular wall
stress. This once adaptive response may decompensate and progress into heart failure. On the other hand,
myocardial infarction causes significant structural damage of the heart. The common clinical practice to treat
cardiac ischemia via restoration of coronary arteries leads to additional reperfusion injury. Insults from ischemia
and reperfusion together significantly weaken the pumping function of the heart. Despite extensive interests and
urgent clinical needs, our understanding of the mechanisms for heart failure development remains limited.
 Pathological cardiac remodeling is a common route of both hypertensive and ischemic heart diseases. In
response to either elevated demand or cardiac damage, the heart mounts an acute reaction to compensate for
the loss of cardiac contractility. Under persistent stress, however, decompensation occurs and heart failure
develops. Previous studies have shown that metabolic alteration precedes most if not all other changes during
pathological cardiac remodeling. However, the contribution and mechanism of metabolic remodeling in heart
failure is still elusive.
 Preliminary results here show that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is acutely and significantly augmented
in the heart in response to pressure overload, preceding structural and electrophysiological alterations. Moreover,
Cad (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) as the rate-limiting
enzyme of this pathway is strongly induced. On the other hand, de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is also
upregulated by reperfusion after ischemia. Based on previous findings and these pilot data, a hypothesis of
pyrimidine biosynthesis in pathological cardiac remodeling has been formulated. Both gain-of and loss-of-
function mouse models have been generated that will be employed to test 1) the role of Cad and de novo
pyrimidine biosynthesis in pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy, 2) the role of Cad and de novo pyrimidine
in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion-caused pathological cardiac remodeling, and 3) the feasibility of using a Cad
inhibitor to arrest heart failure development under hypertensive and ischemic heart disease conditions. In vitro
experiments using primary cardiac myocyte culture will be performed to corroborate the in vivo tests. Elucidation
of the role of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis during pathological cardiac remodeling and heart failure will
advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertensive and ischemic heart diseases and pave a way
for novel, more effective therapeutic design."
10795682,"Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) is a non-integrin collagen receptor having important but poorly understood
skeletal functions. Inactivating mutations in DDR2 cause spondylo-meta-epiphyseal dysplasia (SMED-short
limb type), a human disorder with severe craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities. Ddr2-deficient mice have a
similar phenotype including abnormal skull shape, delayed suture fusion and defective cartilage
growth/orientation in synchondroses at the base of the skull, shortened long bone growth plates and reduced
trabecular and cortical bone mass. Preliminary studies where Ddr2 was selectively inactivated in skeletal
progenitors indicate distinct functions in cells of the bone lineage. Studies will test the following hypothesis:
DDR2 is an important regulator of bone formation that functions in bone lineage cells to sense the collagenous ECM niche
and thereby stimulate SPC lineage commitment and differentiation; on activation by fibrillar collagens, DDR2
synergistically interacts with β1 integrins to stimulate osteoblast differentiation. Aims are:
1. Establish the distribution, fates and gene expression profile of Ddr2-positive cells during craniofacial and
skeletal development. Hypothesis: During development, Ddr2 is expressed in SPCs as well as more mature bone cells.
Studies will: a) establish the time course and pattern of Ddr2 expression during skeletal development, b) define
the lineage of Ddr2-expressing cells, c) Define the molecular signature of Ddr2-expressing cells and their
progeny using single-cell RNAseq.
2. Define the cellular sites of action of DDR2 in the craniofacial and appendicular skeleton. Hypothesis: Ddr2
functions in both SPCs and committed chondrogenic and osteogenic cells to stimulate bone formation. It is not known
which skeletal cells require DDR2 for normal function; skeletal SCs, differentiated cells or both. a) To define
cellular functions of DDR2, a targeted deletion approach will be used to inactivate Ddr2 in Gli+
craniofacial/skeletal progenitors, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. b) To determine if Ddr2 controls the
differentiation of SPCs, the effect of Ddr2 deficiency on the lineage of Gli1+ SPCs will be examined.
3. Examine the mechanistic basis for interactions between DDR2 and collagen-binding β1 integrins.
Hypothesis: DDR2 and β1 integrins synergistically interact to stimulate cellular activity. Collagen-binding β1 integrins
and DDR2 synergistically interact. The mechanistic basis for this synergy will be established using in vitro and
in vivo approaches as follows: a. Examine interactions between DDR2 and integrin signaling during osteoblast
differentiation. b. Use a genetic approach to detect Ddr2 and β1 integrin interactions in vivo.
 Proposed studies will elucidate the skeletal functions of DDR2 and its interactions with β1 integrins. This is
a highly significant but understudied area with important implications for understanding the role of cell-
collagen interactions in bone diseases including SMED, osteoporosis and diabetes. In addition, bone-targeted
DDR2 agonists if developed could be a new class of bone anabolic agents."

threatening diagnosis or condition occurring as a direct result of pregnancy and childbirth—the implications of
reducing maternal morbidity for black maternal health are profound. Morbidity during the postpartum period, as
represented by postpartum hospital readmissions, is also 30% more likely to impact black women. Effective
interventions developed from a comprehensive, multilevel evidence base are needed to successfully eliminate
these disparities. However, many of these multilevel factors remain understudied, and translation of evidence
into action remains challenging due to complex inter-relationships across factors that produce unanticipated
outcomes. The objectives of this study are to address this twofold gap by 1) investigating neighborhood
opportunity access as an understudied multilevel factor in relation to racial/ethnic disparities in maternal
morbidity and 2) using systems science methodologies, such as system dynamics, in a participatory framework
to develop a causal system map that contextualizes the role of neighborhood opportunity access within the
complex, inter-related system shaping racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity. Using Philadelphia, PA as
a base case, I will partner with the Maternal, Child, and Family Health Division in the Philadelphia Department
of Public Health to leverage linked hospital discharge, birth record, and neighborhood indicator data to
accomplish the following aims: (1) To estimate associations between neighborhood opportunity access and
severe maternal morbidity, using a composite measure that includes indicators from the social, physical, and
built environment, and assess whether it explains racial/ethnic disparities; (2) To estimate associations
between neighborhood opportunity access and postpartum hospital readmissions, and assess whether it
explains racial/ethnic disparities; (3) To develop a qualitative system map detailing the causal feedback
structure driving associations between neighborhood opportunity access and racial/ethnic disparities
peripartum maternal morbidity, contextualized within an ecosystem of other multilevel factors, using
participatory system dynamics methodologies. The K01 will allow me to gain integral training in the use of
administrative data for population health, advanced spatial statistics to geospatially contextualize health
disparities, and participatory systems science methodologies to support the translation of evidence into action
to eliminate health disparities. This will help me achieve my long-term goal of successfully building a rigorous
research agenda that uses applied methodologies to understand the sociostructural determinants of
racial/ethnic disparities in maternal and infant health and informs the development of sustainable policies and
programs to eliminate them."

Mendelian conditions, particularly those presenting during childhood, are a major disease burden causing
suffering and taxing the healthcare system. Clinical approaches including exome sequencing have led to a
rapid increase in the number of conditions with known genetic causes and new treatment options for many rare
diseases, but are restricted to finding small coding and splice junction variants, missing most non-coding
variants as well as structural and copy number variants. This challenges interpretation due to the vast number
of variants that must be analyzed for possibly causing a disease.
To accelerate the pace of Mendelian disease gene discovery and clinical implementation, we propose a
Pediatric Mendelian Genomics Research Center (MGRC), leveraging the broad pediatric clinical and
research expertise of Children’s National Hospital and Research Institute in a partnership with Invitae’s
expertise in providing comprehensive and affordable genetic testing. Our Center will unite world class
experts combining basic and translational research with innovative approaches to phenotyping, variant
identification and functional investigation of both coding and non-coding sequence changes with the goals of
discovering novel Mendelian gene variations and identifying variants not detected on current sequencing
pipelines, disambiguating uncertain variants into disease-causing versus benign categorizations, and sharing
information by working collaboratively with the MGRC community. To answer these challenges, this proposal
will address the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Identify novel causes of Mendelian conditions - Discover: Our center will enroll patients with likely
Mendelian diseases and previously non-diagnostic tests (2,600 samples per year) then systematically re-
analyze whole genomes augmented with long read sequencing, optical mapping, and RNA-seq.
Aim 2: Reclassify uncertain variants and investigate the mechanisms of undiagnosed Mendelian
conditions - Disambiguate: Uncertain variants and candidate genes will be further investigated using whole
transcriptome analysis, RNA-seq, CRE-seq, and functional modeling.
Aim 3: Communicate research results to enable translational research on new and rare Mendelian
conditions - Disseminate: Our center is committed to data sharing and dissemination and will ensure that
data is shared with the entire MGRC community through the data coordinating center. Through our industry
partnership, clinically valid pipelines will be rapidly scaled for clinical implementation globally.
Our overall approach provides an efficient and direct path to diagnosis for patients affected with undiagnosed
Mendelian conditions, promotes gene discovery and reclassification of Variants of Uncertain Significance
through a combination of innovative approaches, and will allow individuals, families and healthcare providers to
improve the management of disease."
10794087,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nutrient intake is a key factor in both maintaining and restoring good health but compliance with nutrition
guidelines remains low. A better understanding of the factors controlling food choice and intake could inform
more precisely designed dietary recommendations, thus improving compliance, and ultimately curtailing the
personal and public health burdens of chronic disease. Chief among the factors that influence food intake is
taste. Taste buds are distributed in relatively segregated fields in the oral cavity, with ~70% of taste buds located
on the tongue. Taste buds of the anterior tongue are innervated by the chorda tympani (CT) branch of CN VII
and the posterior field is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (GL; CN IX). Decades of taste nerve
transection studies in rodent models suggest that the signals in these nerves do not contribute equally to taste
functions. Input from the CT, along with that from the greater superficial petrosal branch of CN VII which
innervates palatal taste buds, is essential for taste identification and discrimination. Input from the GL, in contrast,
is critical to both oromotor rejection reflexes and, combined with the CT, avoidance responses to bitter tastes.
Central to this proposal, in rats, the GL is critical for maintenance of normal corn oil preference. Although the
lingual gustatory nerves are among the first to provide sensory information about food as it enters the alimentary
tract, there is little research investigating how the information these nerves provide affects critical nutritionally
relevant behaviors like food selection and meal patterning. Recently, we found that, in male rats, combined CT
and GL transection (2Nx) alters food choices, leading to increased fat intake and reduced carbohydrate intake,
concurrent with an increase in meal size and decrease in meal number. Thus, in rats, 2Nx affects the choice of
foods and how those foods are consumed. Here, we propose to use our custom 5-Item Food Choice Monitor
(FCM) to assess intake and meal patterns in rats of both sexes offered a cafeteria diet after transection of the
CT (CTx), GL (GLx), 2Nx, or sham surgery to determine the relative role each nerve plays and how they interact
to produce the changes in macronutrient intake and meal patterns that were revealed in our preliminary study
after 2Nx. In an intriguing contrast to our preliminary study, earlier research found that after GLx, rats had lower
corn oil (i.e., fat) intake with no change in chow intake. The disparity between this earlier study and our
preliminary findings suggest food form or energy density could be a factor. Therefore, we will additionally
compare meal patterns and intake of foods varying in form/consistency, fat content, and energy density in rats
after CTx, GLx, 2Nx, or sham surgery to determine the role food characteristics may play. The combination of
selective lingual gustatory nerve transections with meal-by-meal intake data from our state-of-the-art FCM
analysis will provide a direct readout of how selective changes in sensory input affect motor output in the service
of nutritional regulation while generating both publications and strong preliminary data to support a future R01
application."

The human herpesvirus 5 (cytomegalovirus, CMV) infects >50% of the world’s population and causes substantial
morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons. There is no approved vaccine and CMV is a leading
cause of transplant failure and of birth defects. The current standard-of-care therapy for CMV (ganciclovir, GCV),
suffers from rapid evolution of viral resistance arising from the extensive CMV genetic diversity in patients and
there is an unmet clinical need for more effective CMV antivirals with high barriers to resistance. The long-term
goal of this work is to develop antivirals that are resilient to the evolution of resistance. The specific objective of
this proposal is to determine if targeting and disrupting viral transcriptional feedback circuits is a viable antiviral
strategy with a high genetic barrier to the evolution of resistance. Over the past decade our studies characterized
CMV’s master transcriptional circuit, a negative-feedback (i.e., auto-repressive) circuit called the immediate-early
(IE) circuit. We discovered that this negative-feedback circuit functions to maintain homeostatic levels of the
immediate-early 2 (IE86) protein, which is essential for CMV replication but also highly cytotoxic. Based on the
conserved nature of this negative-feedback loop, we developed strategies to disrupt negative feedback and
‘open the loop’, generating cytotoxic levels of IE86 and dramatically inhibiting viral replication. Resistance to
“open-loop lethality” is high and requires evolution of a genetically orthogonal feedback loop—a high genetic
barrier—and led to our development of DNA duplexes that competitively inhibit feedback, now termed “feedback
disruptor (FD) molecules”. Our extensive preliminary data show that FD molecules generate open-loop lethality
in virus-infected cells, leading to multi-log (>100x) reduction in virus titers and protecting CMV-infected mice from
death without detected toxicity. Based on these extensive preliminary data in animals, our central hypothesis is
that disruption of IE feedback circuitry is a pharmacokinetically viable strategy with a high barrier to the evolution
of resistance. The rationale for the FD approach rests upon our development of escape-resistant antivirals for
other rapidly mutating viruses and an established body of literature demonstrating that recapitulating disrupted
feedback loops carries a high genetic cost. The specific aims will test our hypothesis that feedback is
pharmacokinetically druggable and resilient to the evolution of resistance by: (i) developing a new type of PK/PD,
viral dynamics model of feedback disruptors to aid clinical translation of the antiviral strategy, (ii) testing if
silencing of cell-death pathways is a mechanism for resistance to FD ‘open-loop lethality’ and (iii) determining
the minimal viral genetic modifications that enable mutational escape from FDs, or if the resistance barrier can
be overcome. These studies will have broad significance in establishing transcriptional feedback as a druggable
target and quantifying the resistance barrier. Payoffs will be a first-in-class antiviral that could catalyze a new
drug paradigm targeting feedback circuitry."

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most prevalent histological type of esophageal malignancy in the US
and many Western nations. This tumor remains deadly as approximately 80% of patients are diagnosed at
advanced stages and have a low five-year survival rate. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the
strongest risk factors for EAC. In GERD patients, the epithelial lining of the esophagus is exposed to the
gastroesophageal reflux (GER) that contains gastric acid frequently mixed with duodenal bile. The esophageal
epithelial cells undergoes severe damage from exposure to acid and bile salts. This exposure also promotes
inflammation, which can exacerbate tissue damage and lead to the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE).
BE is a preneoplastic condition that is disposed to malignant transformation. The molecular mechanisms of
esophageal tumorigenesis in conditions of esophageal reflux injury remain poorly understood. We have
developed an innovative hypothesis to investigate how isolevuglandin (isoLG) lipid derivatives that adduct
multiple proteins in conditions of esophageal reflux facilitate tumorigenic processes by protein adduction. IsoLGs
are formed from the free radicals induced peroxidation of lipids and cyclooxygenase (COX) and are highly
reactive for lysine as well as other cellular amines. IsoLGs bind covalently with the protein molecules to inflict
damage before being recognized by cellular defense mechanisms. In our experimental conditions of esophageal
reflux, p63 is found to be one of the most adducted proteins by isoLGs. P63 is a master regulator of esophageal
epithelial development, which also regulate a broad spectrum of genes involved in different cellular processes
such as DNA repair, stemness, proliferation and differentiation. Our preliminary data strongly support the
hypothesis by providing evidence of the alteration of p63 protein by adduction. In aim 1, using in vitro cell
systems, this proposal will examine the unique mechanisms regulating p63 signaling pathway by protein
adduction and its biological impact in conditions of esophageal reflux injury. In aim 2, we will study the p63
protein adduction in in vivo mice model and test various pharmacological options to reverse this process. If
successful, this study will provide a new therapeutic approach to prevent the pro-tumorigenic alterations of
esophageal cancer."

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the prevalent primary malignant brain tumor accounting for 80% of all brain
cancer patients. It is typically associated with poor prognosis. The standard of care for GBM patients consists of
bulk surgical resection of the tumor mass in combination with focal radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy,
using temozolomide (TMZ). Despite intense efforts, the prognosis of glioma patients remains dismal. Novel
approaches are greatly needed for this devastating form of brain cancer. Signal and Transducer of Activation 3
(STAT3) transcription factor has been proven to be a very attractive therapeutic target for malignant brain tumors,
as their growth is highly dependent of STAT3 signaling. Preliminary data from our team clearly suggest that
currently available small molecule STAT3 inhibitors are highly effective at eliciting regression of GBM tumors
growing in the periphery. In contrast, these same small molecule STAT3 inhibitors were ineffective in treating
GBM tumors located within the brain. We demonstrated that the lack of efficacy is due to limited BBB transport.
Similar difficulties are encountered for the delivery of other established chemotherapeutics, specifically paclitaxel
(PTX). Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems offer potential solutions, but current delivery carriers have still
relatively low efficacy or require invasive intracranial delivery, to enable transport of therapeutics across the
blood-brain-barrier. In our preliminary studies, we were able to demonstrate that albumin-based drug delivery
carriers developed by our group significantly accumulate in intracranial tumors after systemic administration. In
this proposal, our interdisciplinary team will develop and evaluate a novel and scalable bi-compartmental human
serum albumin-based carrier system that allows controlled encapsulation of therapeutic ratios of STAT3 siRNA
and PTX within distinct compartments of the same albumin-based drug delivery carrier, while also incorporating
tumor-penetrating peptides, which have been previously shown to promote nanoparticle penetration into GBMs.
The experiments will test the hypothesis that the proposed bi-compartmental (bi-NP) STAT3i/PTX delivery
carriers in combination with standard of care, i.e., radiation therapy (IR) and TMZ, will significantly improve medial
survival of intracranial GBM bearing mice. We also hypothesize that the co-release of STAT3 siRNA and PTX,
when spatially and temporally orchestrated by an appropriately designed delivery carrier, will not exhibit
untoward adverse side effects in the host, neither within the brain, nor systemically. This work may result in a
new treatment modality for GBM, a tumor type, for which no effective treatments exist. New information on
accessing brain tumors with drugs will also ensue. Our ultimate goal is to translate this novel therapeutic modality
to patients with GBM by implementing Phase I clinical trials."

10802430,"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) is a debilitating type of hemorrhagic stroke that affects ~50,000 annually in
the US. It is caused by a rupture of a cerebral aneurysm and hemorrhage into the subarachnoid space around
the brain. In those who survive the initial bleed, ~30% of the patients develop a serious secondary complication
called delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DCI typically occurs at 4-21 days after SAH and is characterized by focal
neurological deficits. Though DCI is a potentially preventable contributor to morbidity after SAH, interventional
studies targeting DCI have failed. A major hindrance in SAH research is our inability to prognosticate which SAH
patient will develop DCI. This leads to all SAH patients being observed for prolonged periods in the intensive
care unit leading to higher rates of in-hospital complications, potential delay in treatment and misappropriated
resources. Furthermore, because of the inability to risk-stratify SAH patients, randomized clinical trials require
large populations, are expensive and have failed to identify effective treatments. Inclusion of subjects who are
less likely to develop DCI, have led to exposing them to unwanted side effects from the treatment with no
potential benefits. Identification of patients who will develop DCI is an unmet clinical need. Currently, there are
no biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to serve as a clinically useful screening test. This proposal
therefore addresses a major unmet clinical need: a lack of a biomarker that can prognosticate DCI. Through a
series of previous clinical studies, we have demonstrated that SAH leads to increases in systemic
pathophysiological responses. We showed that an early elevated pathophysiological response, quantified by
measuring plasma protein biomarkers, was associated with the development of DCI. We have expanded this
line of investigation and via targeted proteomic profiling in pilot cohorts. First, we identified 6 plasma proteins
that are prognostic of DCI within 48 hours of SAH. Second, using multivariate statistical and machine learning
approaches, we identified a biomarker signature (a combination of proteins) that improved DCI prognostication.
In this study, we propose to identify and confirm additional candidate biomarkers, develop and internally validate
protein detection technology and verify the proof of concept in a prospective cohort. Performance characteristics
of the candidate markers and the signature will be determined and validated for clinical use. Development of
effective, minimally invasive biomarkers for DCI prognostication will lead to significant improvements in SAH
management.
Public/Health/Relevance: SAH has detrimental effects on individual health and the economy as a whole. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it will improve prognostication of DCI (an avoidable complication after SAH). This would lead to discovery of proteins that prognosticate DCI, improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCI and lead to improvements in design of clinical trials targeting DCI."
10802297,"The goal of this mentored career development award is to facilitate the candidate’s transition to independence
as a physician-scientist studying the molecular and neuronal mechanisms of stroke recovery. The candidate is
an MD/PhD neurologist with a background in synaptic physiology and cortical network research. The award will
help the candidate gain research experience in the mechanisms of network recovery after ischemic stroke and
will facilitate his transition to an investigator with an independent laboratory. The award will also help position
the candidate to achieve his long term goal of becoming a successful and productive physician-scientist, a leader
in academic neurology, and a mediator of translational research which improves the lives of patients suffering
from acute brain injury. The environment in which the proposed research will be conducted is outstanding. The
candidate’s co-mentor, Dr. Jin-Moo Lee, is an internationally recognized scientist and neurologist with a proven
track record of excellence in training junior faculty. The candidate’s career development plan also includes
structured mentorship from multiple physician-scientists at all stages of seniority and exposure to a rich and
supportive faculty, ensuring the candidate has role models along the full spectrum of the career trajectory.
Didactic learning, presentation at scientific meetings, and rigorous training in the responsible conduct of research
will ensure balanced development. The proposed research will examine the role of axonal sprouting in restoration
of both local cortical circuits and secondary reconnection to global brain networks. Recovery after focal cortical
stroke is associated with remapping of the function of the infarcted region to adjacent, non-infarcted cortex.
Recovery is also associated with restoration of disrupted functionally connected networks. While both
phenomena (local circuit remapping and restoration of functional connectivity) are strongly associated with stroke
recovery, the underlying structural substrate is unknown. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that
axonal sprouting mediates cortical remapping via reconnection of local circuits. A secondary hypothesis is that
further axonal sprouting originating from the remapped cortex mediates restoration of whole-brain functional
connectivity by reintegrating the disconnected circuit into global networks. This project further hypothesizes that
the degree of recovery of these two processes (local remapping and restoration of functionally connected
networks) correlates to the degree of behavioral stroke recovery. Clarifying the underlying mechanisms driving
network repair after stroke will provide crucial insights into recovery after ischemic brain injury and will be the
basis for future studies attempting to harness these mechanisms to improve outcomes for stroke survivors. This
career development award is an ideal mechanism to provide the candidate with valuable research training to
complement his clinical focus on caring for patients with acute brain injury and will help him develop a skill set
for translating basic science discoveries into effective therapies for patients suffering from stroke."
10800050,"Abstract
Chronic pain is common and often inadequately treated in older individuals. Although opioids are often used to
treat chronic pain, their use in older adults is associated with increased rates of falls, fractures, and mortality.
Advancing our understanding of non-pharmacological chronic pain treatment in Americans ≥60 years of age
will substantially alleviate the burdens caused by this condition. Experimental pain paradigms mimic the
experience of clinical pain (both neuropathic via thermal paradigms, as well as musculoskeletal via mechanical
paradigms) and provide a rigorously controlled approach to advancing the understanding of pain treatments.
Two efficacious, non-pharmacological chronic pain treatments are mindfulness meditation (MM) and self-
hypnosis (HYP). Prior research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown MM and HYP
may target changes in both unique and shared central pain mechanisms. However, it is not yet known whether
these same neuromodulatory changes underlie treatment-related reductions in chronic pain in older persons.
Given that aging affects the prefrontal cortex and both MM and HYP effectively target this region, these
interventions may be particularly well suited to enhance descending inhibitory pain control in older adults via
prefrontal cortical mechanisms. There is also a critical lack of research examining patient characteristics that
moderate treatment outcome. Our preliminary research using electroencephalography (EEG) has identified
pre-treatment brain-state variables that may predict who benefits most from MM and HYP. To identify the
neuromodulatory mechanisms of MM and HYP for chronic pain in older individuals, the proposed study will
include formal statistical tests of both mediation and moderation in a fully-powered clinical trial with N = 375
older adults with chronic pain (enrolled). The design will employ a 3-arm (MM, HYP, attention control) trial,
resulting in tightly controlled tests of treatment mechanisms to accomplish the study aims. Treatment will
consist of four, 20-minute sessions delivered over four consecutive days. The primary outcome will be change
in chronic pain intensity from pre- to post-training. Aim 1 will use perfusion-based arterial spin labelling fMRI to
determine the neuromodulatory mediators of treatment-related chronic pain intensity reductions, relative to the
control. Aim 2 will identify pre-treatment psychological and EEG-assessed moderators of reduced chronic pain
intensity in response to MM and HYP, relative to the control condition. The knowledge gained from adequately
powered, formal tests of mediation will provide an empirical basis for developing more efficacious pain
interventions that may also have a preventative-medicine role in older adults, thereby reducing the public
health burden incurred with chronic pain in this population. Elucidating the moderators of MM and HYP will
inform precision medicine and will also optimize the cost-effectiveness of chronic pain treatments."

 Computational neuroscience has proved itself to be a powerful companion to experimental studies; it
provides tools to assess theories of neural function and to infer dynamics across scales. This continuing
project will extend the open-source NEURON simulator, a leading platform in computational neuroscience, to
provide faster simulations, to support more types of models, and to interoperate with more tools and data
sources. The neuroscience community has used NEURON to build many new tools and neural models over its
30+ year history; over 2800 papers have reported work performed in NEURON (well over 100 in the last year).
The NEURON project seeks to increase power and ease-of-use for computational neuroscience models.
NEURON supports broad multiscale biophysical research to provide understanding of activity between, among
and within scales from cytoplasmic and extracellular molecules, through ion channels, synapses, spines,
dendrites, neurons, and local and wide-area networks. It is used directly by experimentalists and students with
little or no programming experience, providing direct mappings to familiar biological concepts through GUIs
(several alternatives). It is also used by advanced modelers who appreciate its powerful model specification
and analysis programming interface (available in Python and HOC), speed, and cross-platform support;
NEURON models run on macOS, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, and cloud-based environments on individual
workstations and on supercomputers. User-developed components are modular and reusable, facilitating a
culture of code sharing in the community: over 800 NEURON models are available for use via the neural-
model repository ModelDB.
 We propose improvements through the following Specific Aims to provide 1: Machine-learning to reduce
multiscale, multicompartment models: massive complex models are difficult to understand, require
supercomputers to simulate, and are hard to manipulate. Our new tools will provide a principled way to obtain
reduced models from biophysical models with multiple synaptic input types and locations. Such models can be
used together with detailed models to study how changes at the cellular- or molecular-level affect large-scale
network behavior. 2: Platform for melding across simulation tools and across languages by providing
NEURON with an Application Programming Interface (API) for interoperability with other tools. The first use of
the API will be for connections with MATLAB and with musculature simulations. In future, the API will be useful
to extend NEURON use to multiple other popular languages including Julia and C++. 3: Acceleration in
numerical integration through reorganization of internals to make it possible to use GPUs and better exploit
modern hardware. This will also reduce code fragility that leads to bugs. 4: Continuing dissemination,
teaching and support with development of new documentation and tutorials, courses from undergraduate to
high technical levels (zoom and in-person), answering questions in the NEURON forum and in email queries."
10800052,"ABSTRACT
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including abuse, neglect, household and community dysfunction,
represent potentially traumatic psychosocial stressors that occur during critical development periods and
represent a latent risk factor for future cardiovascular disease (CVD). ACE exposure promotes cardiovascular
disease risk in adulthood in a dose-dependent manner, such that adults exposed to 4 or more ACEs have a
more than two-fold increased risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke compared to individuals with no ACEs.
ACEs are also widespread, with 1 in 6 US adults reporting exposure to four or more ACEs. Identification of
modifiable, bio-behavioral mechanisms by which ACEs promote early onset CVD risk is critical to establish
effective interventions to improve cardiovascular health in the millions of individuals affected by ACEs. Our recent
evidence indicates that young adults exposed to ACEs demonstrate impaired vascular endothelial function that
is manifest prior to overt elevations in blood pressure or other CVD risk factors, and that is related to systemic
oxidative stress. These vascular impairments were also observed alongside poor sleep, and our strong
preliminary data suggests that poor sleep quality, or low sleep efficiency, may mediate the association of ACE
exposure with vascular dysfunction. Therefore, we propose that disturbed sleep is a critical, modifiable bio-
behavioral pathway by which ACEs promote vascular dysfunction in early life. Here, we propose the critical
studies necessary to understand the causal, mechanistic role of disturbed sleep in ACEs-related endothelial
dysfunction in young adults. To do so, we propose to 1) objectively quantify the degree to which lower sleep
quality contribute to ACEs-related endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress in young adults,
and 2) manipulate sleep quality using an established behavioral sleep intervention, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
for Insomnia (CBT-I), in a cohort of young adults with moderate-to-severe ACE exposure in order to establish
the causal, mechanistic role of disturbed sleep in ACEs-related vascular endothelial dysfunction. To accomplish
these aims, we will use an innovative translational human approach that includes rigorous at home sleep
monitoring using actigraphy and polysomnography, in vivo assessment of endothelial function via flow-mediated
dilation testing, and in vitro determination of endothelial cell inflammation and oxidative stress from biopsied
endothelial cells. Notably, while vascular endothelial dysfunction contributes to and is prognostic of future CVD,
it is also reversable. Thus, outcomes of this study are expected to be of high impact by identifying and
understanding how disturbed sleep, a key, targetable bio-behavioral mechanism, contributes to vascular
endothelial dysfunction in young adults with exposure to ACEs."

Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and act on hypothalamic AGRP neurons to promote food intake. Due to the
potent orexigenic action of ghrelin, the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a is considered a promising target for the
treatment of obesity. Our discoveries made during the first period of this project revealed that, in vivo, GHSR1a
is in complex with the accessory protein MRAP2 and that, in this physiologically relevant environment, the
pharmacology of GHSR1a is vastly different than what was depicted in heterologous systems. Indeed, in the
presence of MRAP2, GHSR1a does not display its well documented elevated constitutive activity, has an
enhanced response to ghrelin and only weekly interacts with b-arrestins. Those findings challenge our
understanding of ghrelin action and GHSR1a signaling in vivo and, thus, may warrant a reevaluation of the drug
development strategies targeting GHSR1a for the treatment of obesity. The goal of this proposal is to accurately
elucidate the physiological relevance of each known signaling component of GHSR1a in vivo and their regulation
by MRAP2 by 1) determining the contribution of MRAP2-mediated inhibition of b-arrestin recruitment to GHSR1a
for ghrelin action in AGRP neurons; 2) Investigate the importance of MRAP2-mediated abrogation of GHSR1a
basal activity on ghrelin action in AGRP neurons and 3) Assessing the requirement of MRAP2-mediated
enhancement of ghrelin-stimulated Gaq/11 signaling in AGRP neurons. Using new tools developed in our lab, and
state of the art technics for targeted gene silencing in specific neurons and feeding studies, we will accurately
determine, in vivo, the role of each of those aspects of GHSR1a signaling for ghrelin function. We will also
comprehensively investigate the relative importance of each of MRAP2 actions on GHSR1a signaling for the
orexigenic action of ghrelin. Completion of this project will provide a clear understanding of GHSR1a signaling
and regulation in its endogenous environment and establish the functional importance of the modulation of G-
protein and b-arrestin dependent signaling by MRAP2. These results will have tremendous implications in
informing future efforts to modulate GHSR1a signaling to promote weight loss and demonstrate the importance
of studying GPCRs in their endogenous context and in the presence of their modulatory accessory proteins."

In the study of disease, the polygenic factors that lead to genetic adaptation in species, essentially who will be asymptomatic
while under environmental stressors, mostly remain undiscovered. Without a comparative understanding of these unique
features by cell type, that evolution has preserved, our efforts to more broadly implement precision medicine will be limited
in multiple phenotypes. One of the most promising applications of evolutionary medicine has been the use of divergent
animal models to deconstruct and uncover fundamental concepts of biological organization in great detail. The Mexican
cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus provides a rapidly growing model system to apply principles of evolutionary medicine to
study trait variation. We have implemented a toolbox of genetic tools that allow for functional interrogation of various traits
in the Mexican cavefish, but key resources are missing. This model species consists of surface and cavefish populations that
possess natural trait differentiation, often displaying genetic adaption associated with environmental change, without
impacting health or longevity. The objectives of our studies are to generate three tiers of community requested resources:
high-quality surface and cavefish genome assemblies, using powerful single-cell sequencing technology a cell atlas with
differentiating gene expression data sets and targeted gene reporter constructs coupled with a spatial understanding of their
gene regulatory effects. This compendium of resource data and methodology can serve a large community wishing to test
various hypotheses of adaptation in this species and others. Our proposed research objectives are significant in that they
will contribute comparative gene networks that reveal novel differences with a growing assemblage of gene candidates for
human diseases."
10804622,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) is
associated with an increased risk for a number of different malignances. The most common cancers within this
population are Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, such as primary effusion lymphoma
(PEL). While KS is an endothelial cell-derived lesion PEL is of B cell origin. The etiological agent of KS and PEL
is the oncogenic DNA virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV displays two distinct
phases of its viral lifecycle, latency and lytic infection, and both are required for the progression to and
maintenance of KSHV-associated cancers. The remodeling of cellular gene expression during infection plays an
essential role in the establishment of latency as well as progression to the lytic phase. Thus, deciphering the
gene regulatory mechanisms operating during KSHV infection will identify processes involved in tumorigenesis
in PLWH as well as identify potential targets for therapeutic development. Transposable elements (TEs) are
genetic sequences that can, or at one time could, move around the genome from one location to another and
recent analyses of the genetic regulatory landscape of mammalian cells have revealed TEs function in a wide
range of regulatory processes, including transcriptional regulation. While the function of TE regulatory elements
has gained appreciation in areas such as stem cell biology, the role of TEs in infectious diseases and cancer,
such as in PLWH is not known. Our study investigates this unknown which is the basis of provocative question
2 (PQ#2). Leveraging 5'-end RNA sequencing technology we have mapped the transcription initiation landscape
of latent and lytic PEL cells and have identified wide-spread transcription of TEs. Moreover, we discovered TEs
transcribed from within annotated gene regulatory elements such as enhancers and gene promoters, and that
some transcribed TEs are bound by the main KSHV-encoded transcription factor, RTA. Remarkably, a targeted
CRISPR screen identified an RTA-bound TE-derived enhancer that significantly affects KSHV lytic reactivation
in PEL. Together with observations from the scientific literature our unpublished data form the scientific premise
for the proposed studies. Our central hypothesis is that TE-derived gene regulatory elements are at the center
of the host-KSHV battle and that their modulation is essential for pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we
propose an integrated series of experiments aimed at determining the interplay between TEs and KSHV. In Aim
1, we will determine the function of RTA-bound TEs in PEL. In Aim 2, we will determine how KSHV infection of
endothelial cells influences TE expression and the consequences of TE-derived regulatory elements on the viral
lifecycle as well as cellular pathways required for tumorigenesis. Completion of these studies is expected to
determine how TEs contribute to KSHV-associated cancer in PLWH. Our findings will represent fundamental
new insights into how oncogenic DNA viruses co-opt the cellular genetic regulatory landscape to cause disease."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a systemic, progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder and type of
synucleinopathy characterized by the presence of misfolded α-synuclein (αSyn) protein aggregates (Lewy
bodies). The majority of PD etiology is not well explained by inherited genetic risk variants, and conversely, is
strongly tied to exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly industrial byproducts such as pesticides,
metals, and organic solvents. Data from our lab indicates that exposure to environmental toxicants associated
with PD risk impairs the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), causing aberrant proteostasis and cellular
dysfunction that influences disease development. Furthermore, new data suggests that the PD associated
genetic risk factor and kinase protein LRRK2 plays a key role in lysosomal homeostasis, which implicates the
lysosome as a convergence point for genetic and environmental risk factors in PD.
The chlorinated organic solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) is associated with 2-6 times elevated risk for PD,
however, the mechanisms by which this occurs remain vastly understudied considering the pervasiveness of
its environmental contamination. We previously showed that exposure to TCE induced endolysosomal deficits,
endogenous αSyn accumulation, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in adult rodents. We also observed that
TCE elevated the kinase activity of wildtype LRRK2 in the brain. In line with this, we have new preliminary
evidence that TCE exposure causes loss of lysosomes, reduced proteolysis in dopaminergic neurons and
significantly worsens αSyn preformed fibril (PFF) accumulation in brain tissue of adult rats. Thus, we
hypothesize that an important mechanism of TCE is disruption of lysosomal function, leading to
proteostasis impairment and neurotoxicity that triggers or facilitates PD development.
This proposal is designed to uncover the mechanisms of TCE-induced lysosomal impairment, aberrant
proteostasis, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with PD risk. To do this, we will use our novel,
environmentally relevant TCE inhalation model to measure how the solvent modulates αSyn PFF aggregation
within the rat brain (Aim 1), and if loss of lysosomal function in central and peripheral neurons using newly
developed Thy1-RFP-GFP-LC3 transgenic mice correlates with αSyn seed amplification signal measured via
RT-QuIC (Aim 2). Last, we will assess how TCE-induced LRRK2 kinase activation influences lysosomal
function and if pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 prevents lysosomal impairments and neurodegeneration
induced by TCE (Aim 3). Together, these experimental aims support a fundamental new mechanism in the risk
for PD and related synucleinopathies from environmental factors and advances the NIEHS strategic plan to
improve human health though environmental exposure research."
10798311,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Effective treatments are elusive for the majority of patients with neuropathic pain, which is reflective of the
incomplete knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. Our proposal will advance mechanistic understanding of
peripheral neuropathic pain maintenance by investigating the differentiation and function of B cells after
peripheral nerve injury. Our long-term goal is to harness the disease-modifying potential of neuroimmune
signaling to treat neuropathic pain. As a step toward achieving this goal, the overall objective of this application
is to discover if and how B cells cause neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury. Our central hypothesis is
that peripheral nerve injury induces differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. The plasma cells secrete
autoantibodies that form complexes with autoantigens which maintain neuropathic pain by signaling through the
activating Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) subtypes (I, III, IV) along the pain neuraxis. We propose that insufficient
efferocytosis (deficient non-inflammatory clearance of apoptotic cells, leading to release of Danger Associated
Molecular Patterns (DAMPs)) at the site of nerve injury, triggers autoimmune B cell differentiation. This
hypothesis is based on strong evidence that plasma cells are pro-nociceptive, as we show that either constitutive
deficiency or pharmacological depletion of differentiating B cells protects male and female mice from neuropathic
pain. Our data also reveal that insufficient efferocytosis leads to B cell differentiation, as pharmacological
stimulation of efferocytosis at the time of peripheral nerve injury reduces immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposits in the
spinal dorsal horn. The rationale for testing our hypothesis is that deciphering this previously overlooked adaptive
immune response to peripheral nerve injury will reveal new and tractable therapeutic targets for neuropathic
pain. To accomplish the overall objective of this application, we will test the central hypothesis in a mouse model
of peripheral nerve injury across the following specific aims: 1) Define the function of B cell differentiation after
peripheral nerve injury. Validation studies will be performed in a piglet model of peripheral injury, and in biological
samples obtained from patients with lumbar radiculopathy; 2) Identify whether FcγR signaling maintains
neuropathic pain; and, 3) Determine whether insufficient efferocytosis induces B cell differentiation leading to
neuropathic pain. The proposed studies take a multidisciplinary approach, including pharmacologic and genetic
manipulations, flow cytometry, in situ hybridization, adoptive transfer, and assessment of evoked and operant
pain behaviors. As efferocytosis and downstream plasma cell differentiation have not been previously implicated
in traumatic neuropathic pain, our proposal is highly innovative and is expected to expand our paradigm for
neuroimmune regulation of peripheral neuropathic pain. The results will have significant impact on the treatment
of peripheral neuropathic pain by revealing new sites for therapeutic intervention."
10798312,"ABSTRACT
Disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) is conceivably driven by mechanisms that contribute to
remyelination failure, and identification of these mechanisms is critical for developing novel therapies. Current
therapies for MS patients are ineffective at treating secondary complications that significantly impact quality of
life, such as sleep and fatigue. The long-term goal of this work is to discover new strategies to facilitate
remyelination in MS patients. While circadian and/or sleep disruptions are common in MS patients, their roles in
affecting the process of remyelination in the context of MS are unknown. The overall objective of this study
therefore is to understand the mechanisms by which circadian rhythm disruption may alter remyelination and
disease progression in MS. The rationale for these studies stems from preliminary observations that circadian
rhythm disruption (CRD) correlates with neurological deficits and leads to remyelination failure in animal models.
Our preliminary data demonstrates that the key circadian regulator, Bmal1, is expressed by oligodendrocyte
lineage cells in mice and MS brains and is critical for remyelination. Based upon these observations, our central
hypothesis is that “Bmal1-mediated circadian disruption contributes to remyelination failure and progression of
disease course in MS”. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will assess the
contribution of CRD gene polymorphisms in MS patients with sleep disturbances and MS brain tissues to
correlate magnetic resonance imaging and pathology of the MS brains with genetic polymorphisms in key
circadian genes. As human studies are not amenable to manipulation, we propose to test the correlative findings
from the human studies using animal models of sleep deprivation and demyelination/remyelination. Specific Aim
2 will address whether changes in circadian rhythm lead to remyelination defects in animal models. Specific Aim
3 will investigate the consequences of cell-specific loss and gain of Bmal1 on CRD-mediated remyelination
defects. This proposal is conceptually innovative because we investigate a previously-unexplored link between
circadian disruption and the process of remyelination and oligodendrocyte biology. The approach is technically
innovative because we propose to use MS patient samples with sleep disruption, MS autopsy tissues, and animal
models with oligodendrocyte- and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell-specific deletion and overexpression of the
key circadian gene, Bmal1. The future of MS therapeutics lies in the identification of additional therapeutic targets
and in developing more comprehensive combinatorial strategies. This work will make a significant impact on the
field of MS research because it will reveal the link between circadian disruption and myelin repair failure, and in
the future will guide the use of drugs directed towards resetting the circadian rhythm to improve clinical outcome
for MS patients."
10795299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal exposure to complex metal mixtures during pregnancy may impair child growth and development to
impact later health. In New York City (NYC), pregnant individuals from low-income and Hispanic communities
are at risk of toxic metals exposure and children from these communities are also more likely to be born small-
for-gestational age (SGA) or with low birthweight, dictating later child growth trajectories, educational attainment,
and socioeconomic advancement. The placenta is the master regulator of fetal development and a first line of
defense against toxic metal exposures. Direct and indirect interactions between toxic (e.g., arsenic [As],
cadmium [Cd], lead [Pb]) and essential (e.g., manganese [Mn], selenium [Se], zinc [Zn]) metals in placental
tissue may result in cellular and molecular damage that can impact placental function. Defining concrete
mechanism(s) for the effects of metals on the placenta will advance efforts to protect millions of children from a
widespread threat. Yet, our insight into placental mechanisms linking prenatal metal exposures to impaired
growth is limited. The discovery of post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, collectively named the
epitranscriptome, as key regulators of placental gene expression provide an innovative avenue to address this
gap. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA (mRNA)
and modulates mRNA splicing, stability, and translation. m6A and its reader, writer, and eraser proteins (RWEs)
that interpret, add, and remove m6A marks, are responsive to toxicant exposures and regulate the cellular
response to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key processes governing metal toxicity to the placenta.
These changes in m6A can subsequently regulate downstream proteomic responses to toxicant exposure. We
hypothesize that essential (Mn, Se, Zn, etc.) and toxic (As, Cd, Pb, etc.) metals accumulated in the placenta
directly influence child health in utero by dysregulating the m6A epitranscriptome and downstream proteome. We
will test our hypotheses with a discovery-replication design in two NYC-based, low income, Hispanic birth
cohorts, Fair Start (FS) (N=400) and Sibling-Hermanos (Hermanos) (N=100). In Aim 1, we will use placental
tissue to investigate 19 metals and their associations with expression of 18 m6A RWEs, transcript-level m6A from
m6A-sequencing, and the inflammation and metabolism-related proteome. In Aim 2, we will identify placental
m6A epitranscriptome and proteome alterations associated with birth outcomes (SGA, birthweight, gestational
length, head circumference, ponderal index) and early child growth trajectories (height, weight, BMI) at ages 0.5,
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. In Aim 3, we will construct a placental “metallome” – a network of the m6A
epitranscriptome and proteome linking prenatal metals to birth outcomes and child growth trajectories. Together,
these aims will lead to novel insight into the mechanisms linking placental metals, the placental epitranscriptome,
and the ensuing effects on child growth and development. It will open new avenues for metals risk assessment
and the development of placenta-based therapeutics to avert the harmful impacts of metals on child health."
10796217,"In adult zebrafish, Müller glia are the source of new retinal neurons (57). While adult mammals also possess
Müller glial cells, they do not typically possess the same regenerative abilities found in zebrafish. However,
recently, this lab has provided evidence that Müller glia induce Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MDPC) in
adult rodents. Specifically, eye drop treatment with the selective alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
agonist, PNU-282987, has been shown to cause dedifferentiation of Müller glia and neurogenesis in the adult
rodent retina (15-19). This current R15 grant proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that PNU-282987-
induced neurogenesis of retinal neurons in adult mice occurs through indirect activation of Müller glia. Two
specific aims have been designed to address this hypothesis. The first specific aim is designed to quantify the
specific retinal cell populations that undergo mitosis and proliferation after application of PNU-282987 in the adult
mammalian retina using flow cytometry. Previous results from this lab demonstrated that eye drop application of
PNU-282987 induced neurogenesis of photoreceptors and RGCs that originated from Müller glia (19). Specific
aim #1 is designed to determine and quantify what specific retinal cell populations are affected by eye drop
application of PNU-282987 using flow cytometry. Does PNU-282987 induce neurogenesis in all retinal cells?
The Fortessa flow cytometer will be used to detect and count markers associated with various retinal cells, cell
components associated with progenitor cells, Müller glia and mitotically active markers before and after PNU-
282987 treatment. The second specific aim is designed to examine the transcriptome gene changes that occur
in primary cultures of Muller glia that lead to formation of progenitor cells after treatment with an alpha7 nAChR
agonist. In this proposal, primary cell cultures of RPE and Müller glia will be obtained from adult mice to determine
which Müller glia genes are affected by eye drop application of PNU-282987. Primary Muller glia cells will be
cultured in conditioned media obtained from primary cultures of RPE cells obtained from adult mice that are
treated with PNU-282987. It is hypothesized that PNU-282987 binds to alpha7 nAChRs on retinal pigment
epithelium to release signaling molecules onto Muller glia that induce dedifferentiation. After mRNAseq analysis,
up- or down-regulated genes will be compared with published literature of Müller glia genes involved in
development and dedifferentiation. Identified genes will be quantified and verified with RT-PCR, RNAscope
technology (ACDBio) and immunocytochemistry. Once specific genes are identified and potential pathways are
proposed, gene knockout (KO) studies and gene overexpression studies will be performed in primary Muller glia
using CRISPR technology to demonstrate the necessity of these genes in Muller glia-derived neurogenesis
induced by PNU-282987 in adult mice. The results from this study could have significant implications in the retina
where neurons are lost due to aging or diseases such as glaucoma, macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa
and could challenge current ideas that maintain the adult mammalian CNS is incapable of regeneration."
10799555,"PROJECT SUMMARY
von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric plasma protein, plays a critical role in hemostasis. VWF
is synthesized and secreted as ultra-large (UL) multimers that contain 25-50 protomers. If not
processed by a plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS13, ULVWF can initiate the formation of life-
threatening thrombosis as in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). How the proteolytic cleavage
of ULVWF by ADAMTS13 is regulated under physiological conditions is not fully understood. The
cleavage site is buried under the central β-sheet within the A2 domain of VWF, and tensile force is
required to expose the cleavage site for enzymatic cleavage to occur. Our preliminary studies have
demonstrated that coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) may function as a cofactor that facilitates the cleavage
of VWF by ADAMTS13 under mechanic shear. Taking advantage of our unique combination of
molecular, biochemical and single-molecule biophysical tools available in both laboratories, we will test
the hypothesis that the binding of FVIII to VWF-D’D3 and other adjacent domains such as the A2
domain may result in conformational changes in the central A2, thus exposing the cleavage site
(Y1605-M1606) more readily to ADAMTS13 under mechanical force. In Aim 1, we will determine
the mechanical unfolding profile of A2 with or without other adjacent domains in the absence and
presence of FVIII; in Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of A2 and FVIII interactions by
investigating their variants and mutants; and in Aim 3, we will determine the physiological relevance of
the FVIII-dependent proteolytic cleavage of VWF under force and in animal models and human with
heareditary TTP. The completion of the proposed project will help understand the molecular interactions
among substrate, enzyme, and protein cofactor under physiological conditions, which provides
rationales for the development of novel therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of TTP and other
thrombotic and inflammatory disorders."

Cholera is a severe dehydrating illness of humans. It is endemic in over 50 countries and causes 3 to
5 million cases a year, resulting in approximately 100,000 deaths. Currently available cholera
vaccines have shortcomings. They are often poorly immunogenic in children under the age of 5
years, and often do not induce robust long-term memory responses in immunologically naïve
populations. We provide strong preliminary data that antibodies targeting O-specific polysaccharide
(OSP) affect Vibrio cholerae and are associated with protection against cholera. We here propose an
international clinical study approach to investigate the impact of OSP-specific antibodies on V.
cholerae and to define OSP-specific immune responses in humans."

Diversity in the workplace, including the laboratory, leads to more creativity, innovation, and productivity. Yet, in
2022 the AAMC reported that full-time medical school faculty by rank was ~57% white at the assistant professor
level and ~74% white at the full professor level (https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/faculty-
institutions/interactive-data/2022-us-medical-school-faculty). When the numbers are calculated based on
gender, the data are more sobering with almost equal numbers of men vs. women at assistant professor (47,433
vs. 44,370 faculty) but less than half of full-time faculty were women at the full professor level (28,810 vs. 11,403)
and of the women faculty, only ~3217 were not white. Thus, although we know diversity improves innovation,
medical schools are unable to achieve or even maintain a minimal amount of diversity. Given the drop in the
proportion of women and historically marginalized communities from assistant to full professor ranks, it is clear
that medical school environments are not supporting retention of diverse talent. The reasons for this drop are
multi-factorial, and therefore will require a long-term and multi-faceted approach. However, I hypothesize that
mentorship is one factor that is more heavily weighted against others in contributing to maintaining
diversity. Therefore, my overarching goal of this proposal is to improve my own mentorship approach
to incorporate greater cultural awareness in one-on-one mentoring and in laboratory management to
generate successful trainees with greater career satisfaction."

Chronic pain is one of the most pressing public health burdens in the United States, affecting up to 20% of the
population. Substance use disorders (SUDs) often co-occur with chronic pain. The relationship between
chronic pain and opioid use disorder is often attributed to over-use in connection with post-operative pain, but
the underlying mechanisms for chronic pain’s comorbidity with other SUDs (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis) are
unknown. Depression often co-occurs with both chronic pain and SUDs and could be a mediator of the
relationship between pain and SUDs. Socioenvironmental factors, including experiencing discrimination, may
also play a role. Given the role of the brain’s reward system in both pain and SUDs, it is also plausible that
some of the same genetic risk variants contribute to both chronic pain and SUDs. Both chronic pain and SUDs
are moderately heritable and genome-wide association studies have identified loci contributing to their liability.
However, these studies have focused on common variants in predominantly European ancestry individuals.
This proposal, in response to RFA-PM-23-002, would leverage the multi-ancestral phenotypic and genomic
data in All of Us to characterize the relationships between four of the most common SUDs (alcohol, tobacco,
cannabis, and opioid use disorders) and chronic pain in a diverse sample. Our first aim will be to curate
electronic health records to define a broad measure of chronic pain, as well as more detailed subtypes (e.g.,
neuropathic vs. nociceptive pain, musculoskeletal vs. visceral pain), and examine how these are related to
SUDs. We will test whether a common risk factor, depression, partially mediates the relationship between
chronic pain and SUDs. Further, we will estimate the extent to which social determinants of health (e.g.,
gender, socioeconomic background, experiencing discrimination) are associated with both chronic pain and
SUDs. Our second aim will involve whole-genome analyses of chronic pain in multiple ancestries, identifying
the genes and pathways that contribute to both chronic pain and SUDs, and employing genetically-informed
causal inference models to identify reciprocal relationships. We will use the whole genome sequence data in
All of Us to identify genomic factors – common genetic variants, as well as rare variants – that contribute to risk
for chronic pain. Next, we will use genomic structural equation modeling and gene network analyses to identify
genes and biological pathways that are shared (or distinct) between chronic pain and SUDs. Finally, we will
apply multiple causal inference approaches to assess whether there is evidence for causal relationships
between chronic pain and SUDs. This proposal will clarify the socioenvironmental and genetic mechanisms
associated with chronic pain and SUDs through detailed phenotypic and large-scale genomic analyses on a
diverse sample. The findings from these analyses will advance our understanding of why SUDs and chronic
pain co-occur, leading to improved treatment and prevention efforts through the identification of shared
biological pathways and modifiable psychosocial factors."

Accelerated understanding of nervous system functions and cancer has led to cancer neuroscience evolving into
a new frontier of discovery in cancer biology and therapy. The proposed hybrid Cancer Neuroscience: An
Emerging Hallmark symposium will be held both on-site at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center and virtually in recognition of the comprehensive role the nervous system plays in cancer, including its
initiation, growth, and spread. A platform such as this one that nurtures interdisciplinary discussions among
oncologists, neuroscientists, immunologists, and cancer biologists is an unmet need. Based on the highly
successful, first-of-its-kind 2022 Cancer Neuroscience Symposium that included more than 1200 participants
from 70 countries, we propose to create a platform for cross-fertilization of adjacent disciplines with the long-
term goal of improving cancer treatment and services with targeted inclusion of variables and outcomes in cancer
neuroscience research aiming to reduce disparities based on race, sex, gender, and age. We are seeking partial
support to enable rising postdoctoral fellows, trainees, and junior faculty to attend the Cancer Neuroscience
Symposium. The proposed program will feature a keynote session on communication between cancer and the
nervous system in the brain and another keynote session on these interactions in the peripheral nervous system.
The scientific program will include pioneering results on the impact of cancer on the central and peripheral
nervous systems, neural regulation of cancer, cross-talk between nerves and immune cells, nerves and glial
cells in cancer growth and spread, community and patient advocacy and brain health during cancer therapies,
and neural injury in cancer patients. Our overall goal is to leverage advances in neuroscience and fertilize ideas
from key opinion leaders in cancer biology as well as to leverage advances in immuno-oncology and other
clinically relevant fields as focus areas (e.g., the biology of aging). To achieve this goal, we aim to 1) enable
attendees of the Cancer Neuroscience Symposium to gain knowledge about cancer neuroscience investigations
and methodologies and foster collaboration and cross-institution mentorship to advance the field of cancer
neuroscience around the world; 2) recruit and invite speakers and attendees from diverse backgrounds (i.e.,
race, sex and gender) to participate in the Cancer Neuroscience Symposium and make a significant impact on
the field’s future directions; 3) encourage investigators at very early stages of their careers to further pursue
interdisciplinary cancer neuroscience research as a long-term career; and 4) provide financial registration and
travel support to enable trainees and students to present their research at the Cancer Neuroscience Symposium
in a safe, public scientific environment. This “call to arms” will spur research to help fill critical gaps across the
spectrum of cancer patient care and treatment strategies. The Cancer Neuroscience Symposium will be at the
leading edge of the intersection of exciting new breakthroughs in the world of neurobiology and discoveries in
fundamental cancer biology that will break down the barriers that have separated these fields in the past."

A loss of olfaction, termed anosmia, is strongly associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and often precedes
the development of cognitive decline or other symptoms. Currently, we lack disease-modifying treatments for
olfactory disorders or for AD. Mechanisms driving olfactory loss in preclinical AD, and its relationship to
disease progression, remain unclear. To gain insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which
sensory system changes underlie the pathogenesis of AD, we will apply newly developed approaches to
analyze human olfactory cells. We will perform olfactory function testing and obtain minimally invasive olfactory
biopsies from pre-clinical or symptomatic Alzheimer’s subjects, leveraging a newly developed Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center at Duke/University of North Carolina. Samples will be processed for single cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq), generating a series of data sets to be shared with the field. Using our established
normal or hyposmic human olfactory single cell data sets, as well as new controls, we will compare
transcriptional profiles in olfactory neurons, neuron progenitors, and associated supporting populations in early
or later stages of disease. We will include clinical metadata such as sex, race and APOE-e4 status to permit
sub-group analyses. Finally, we will focus attention to olfactory immune cells, as neuroinflammation is a
prominent aspect of both non-AD olfactory disorders as well as AD pathogenesis. Defining the immune cell
population changes in early or later disease stages and the gene expression changes in these cells, we will
also perform functional tests on olfactory cells using in vitro assays. An advantage of our approach will be the
ability to evaluate neural tissue from well-characterized human subjects at early or later disease stages, rather
than animal models or post-mortem samples. Together, completion of these studies will identify mechanistic
insights into the pathogenesis of olfactory dysfunction as well as AD progression."

Approximately 50% of children with cerebral palsy (CP) have the speech disorder dysarthria. Dysarthria is
difficult to identify in young children because its characteristics (speech subsystem features) overlap with
features of early typical development. Quantitative standards for differentiating typical from atypical speech
subsystem development in children do not currently exist. This research seeks to improve early identification
and treatment of dysarthria in children with CP by creating clinically accessible, data-based developmental
standards that allow us to differentiate between typical and atypical auditory-perceptual speech subsystem
features in children. To do this, we will validate an English adaptation of the pediatric version of the well-
established Bogenhausen Dysarthria Scales (BoDyS-Kid), including 31 subsystem-based perceptual speech
features and 10 domains. The research will capitalize on speech samples from 573 typically developing (TD)
children, collected in the first funding cycle; and 74 children with cerebral palsy (699 longitudinal speech
samples). We will collect new data from 1300 speech language pathologists (SLPs) who will make auditory-
perceptual ratings of children’s speech using the BoDyS-Kid, comprising the first ever large-scale
comprehensive study of the development of speech subsystem based auditory-perceptual features in English-
speaking children. Specific aims are: 1.) To quantify the maturation of auditory-perceptual speech subsystem
features and domains in typically developing children. 2.) To quantify the maturation of auditory-perceptual
speech subsystem features and domains in children with cerebral palsy. 3.) To identify and quantify auditory-
perceptual speech subsystem features and domains that discriminate among clinical groups and are
associated with speech intelligibility for children with CP and TD. Products of this research will be a.) a

This project combines the expertise of Dr. Katalin Gothard at The University of Arizona [US] and Dr. Anna W.
Roe at Zhejiang University [China]. The aim of this project is to understand changes in the brain underlying the
emergence of social and emotional regulation during adolescence. Adolescence is a period of accelerated social
and cognitive development, and also a time of enhanced vulnerability for anxiety and impulse-control disorders,
which elevate the lifelong risk for secondary psychiatric disorders. During this period, the prefrontal cortex
undergoes maturation, but little is known about the maturation of its relationship with the amygdala, considered
a hub of emotional processing in the brain. In humans and nonhuman primates, the amygdala matures long
before puberty; in early adolescence, emotional processes and arousal governed by the amygdala dominate
emotional and social behavior. As the prefrontal cortex matures and increases its influence on amygdalar
function, emotional behavior becomes more regulated. We hypothesize that the development of emotional
regulation during adolescence is due to changes in amygdala-prefrontal networks. The goal of this proposal is
to monitor longitudinally, in the same individuals, the reorganization of functional connections between the
amygdala and the PFC. This will be accomplished by a multimodal approach of laser-fMRI functional tract tracing,
and neurophysiological recordings in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. In parallel, punctate administration
of behavioral tasks will provide a measure of longitudinal changes in impulsivity and sociability. The fMRI,
neurophysiological, and behavioral measures will be correlated at matched timepoints, thereby achieving a
multiscale (cellular to circuit level to behavior) understanding of adolescent development. The findings from this
study will have significant bearing on our understanding of normal adolescent brain development and also of the
possible risk factors for the emergence of social misadjustment and mental disease."

Dr. Jacqueline S. Garcia is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School/Dana Farber Cancer Institute
(DFCI) with research interests in the biology of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and therapeutics
targeting chemoresistance. The applicant, Dr. Jacqueline Garcia, presents a 5-year career development program
designed to support an academic, clinical/translational investigator. The proposed research project will take
advantage of the clinical and scientific expertise and resources available at the DFCI, which has a long-tradition
of training clinical investigators. This includes a mentorship committee led by Dr. Richard Stone, a highly qualified
and internationally recognized AML clinical trialist. This research will promote training in areas critical to Dr.
Garcia’s career goals: clinical research methods, principles of human research, and translational research tools
as it pertains to conducting patient-oriented investigations. Her long-term goal is to be an independent leukemia
investigator and develop novel scientifically-sound clinical trials for patients with relapsed AML. This proposal
seeks to gain biological understanding of the role of functional assays in leveraging the activity of venetoclax-
based therapies in chemoresistant AML settings to prevent and treat relapse. Key mediators of the anti-apoptotic
pathway determine the cellular response to chemotherapy. Biological tools such as the BH3 profiling assay,
developed by her co-mentor Dr. Anthony Letai, offers the unique opportunity to evaluate a myeloblast’s readiness
to undergo apoptosis (based on cytochrome c release in the presence of BH3 peptides) and its anti-apoptotic
dependencies. Dr. Letai has also developed a drug-specific BH3 profiling assay called dynamic BH3 profiling
(DBP) which measures apoptotic priming following short-term ex vivo drug exposure. Preliminary data shows
that DBP predicts in vivo response to individual or a combination drugs after short-term ex vivo drug exposure.
Venetoclax, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor and BH3 mimetic, is an active drug in acute myeloid leukemia but requires
a drug partner(s) to boost its potency. Her central hypothesis is that BH3 profiling tools will identify effective
personalized drug combinations that will enhance the activity of venetoclax in patients with chemoresistant
myeloblasts. The work outlined in this proposal will use BH3 profiling assays to examine the role of venetoclax
immediately prior to transplant to reduce relapse and at time of relapse. She proposes to: (Aim 1) determine the
impact of adding venetoclax to conditioning chemotherapy on the risk of relapse after transplantation for patients
with poor risk MDS and AML, (Aim 2) characterize the mitochondrial apoptotic priming state in myeloblasts at
diagnosis and upon progression on combination venetoclax and hypomethylating agents to understand acquired
resistance, and (Aim 3) determine the impact of using DBP to guide optimal venetoclax-based drug combinations
to improve response in relapsed AML. If successful, this project will provide evidence of direct clinical translation
from the laboratory and provide a new approach for identifying personalized AML therapies."

 The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal, nationally representative survey of US fami-
lies that began in 1968. With data collected on the same families and their descendants for 42 waves over 53
years, plus two major immigrant refresher samples in 1997–1999 and 2017–2019, PSID can justifiably be con-
sidered a cornerstone for empirical social and behavioral research. PSID provides long-term measurement,
over the life course and across generations, of economic, social, demographic, and health processes, which
has inspired researchers to investigate the dynamics of these processes and their interrelationships. The enor-
mous range of research opportunities provided by PSID has led to it becoming one of the most widely used
social science data sets in the world. PSID’s innovative design, broad content, and long duration have been
central to understanding many key research and policy issues and to advancing life course and intergenera-
tional science. NICHD has co-funded the biennial Core PSID for each of the last 10 waves, from 2003 to 2021.
This project will build upon this investment through the following specific aims: First, to collect data on three
modules—family dynamics, fertility and newborns, and education—as part of the 2023 round of the Core PSID
survey. Second, to design and collect enhanced information on fertility intentions and new data on contracep-
tive use. Third, to clean, document, and distributed these data free of charge through the PSID Online Data
Center, provide continuing outreach and support to new and established data users, and encourage new re-
search using PSID through a small grant competition. This project will make several major contributions. It will
extend the longest-running household panel survey in the world, supporting research on family dynamics, in-
vestments in children, and well-being over the life course, across generations, and over time. Data from PSID
in 2023 will allow researchers to study the effects of Covid-19 on outcomes in the aftermath of the pandemic
and will also support future research on how the life course trajectories for different cohorts were altered by
exposure to the Covid pandemic and its social and economic consequences. The rich data to be collected on
educational progression and attainment will support detailed analyses of the determinants of schooling deci-
sions within the family context as well as the effects of these decisions on life course outcomes. Expanded in-
formation from the newborn module will allow research on birth outcomes and on the consequence of birth out-
comes and very-early life experiences on life course trajectories. Data collected in this project on the dynamic
processes of family formation and dissolution, fertility intentions and contraception, childbearing and adoption,
and living arrangements will allow researchers to understand the evolving complexity and circumstances of
families in the US. Finally, outreach to and support of data users, along with a small grant competition to en-
courage innovative new research, will maximize past and current investments in PSID."
10797422,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs), containing both an estrogen and a progestin, remain the most
commonly used hormonal contraceptive method in the US, and overall, one of the most commonly prescribed
medications among all women. Despite its high prevalence of use, little is known about the pharmacogenomics
of COCPs, which are the relationships between genetic variations and interindividual variability in drug efficacy,
metabolism, and safety. Pharmacogenomic investigations have led to the development of actionable clinical
guidelines for over 40 drug-gene pairs, the majority of which involve drugs far less frequently prescribed than
COCPs. Given the utility of COCPs and similar steroid hormone-containing medications throughout a woman's
lifespan, it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of how individual genetic variation affects the wide
interindividual response to these drugs. However, a major hurdle faced in conducting pharmacogenomic
research with these medications is the lack of useful phenotypic data in existing biobanks. National genetic
consortia are primarily made up of men or postmenopausal women, thus necessitating the creation of new
biobanks that focus on reproductive-age women and collect data on phenotypes specific to steroid hormone
medications. We aim to build a novel biobank of 700 COCP users to both validate previously identified genetic
relationships among contraceptive implant users and to identify novel areas of the human genome associated
with steroid hormone metabolism, contraceptive mechanisms, and side effects. We will collect pharmacokinetic
outcomes from COCP users to evaluate the influence of CYP3A7*1C carrier status, which has been
associated with increased metabolism of other exogenous and endogenous steroid hormones. We will enroll a
subset of 150 COCP users into a matched case-control study to determine how CYP3A7*1C carrier status
affects ovulation inhibition using pharmacodynamic measurements of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis
suppression and dominant ovarian follicle creation. All participants will also complete questionnaires to assess
their side effect profiles after a single cycle of COCP use and undergo serial measurements of clinically
relevant biomarkers. Participants will then be given the opportunity to complete repeat questionnaires and
biomarker measurements after 3, 6, and 13 cycles of continued COCP use. This prospective collection of side
effect and biomarker data will allow for analyses of clinically pertinent phenotypes, such as early COCP
discontinuation and enhanced estrogenecity. We will utilize genome-wide sequencing for all participants so
that we can conduct exploratory genome-wide analyses in addition to our planned targeted approaches. This
study will create the first biobank of COCP users specifically designed with collecting phenotypic data most
pertinent for the eventual creation of precision and personalized medicine clinical tools. These clinical tools will
one day allow women considering steroid hormone medications to assess their individual risk for medication
failure and adverse side effects, thus leading to better informed care and increased patient satisfaction."

The objectives of this proposal are to enhance the successful mission of Georgia Stroke Net by accelerating recruitment into NIH Stroke Net clinical trials for patients with acute stroke, people at risk for recurrent stroke, and individuals recovering from stroke. To enhance the implementation of practice changing research in stroke, the Georgia Stroke Net team will propose new and innovative clinical trials in the areas of acute stroke treatment, secondary prevention of stroke, and rehabilitation after stroke to be conducted within the NIH Stroke Net. We also propose to provide training opportunities for promising young investigators interested in clinical stroke research as a career and implement a career development program for research managers and coordinators. As a currently funded NIH Stroke Net Regional Coordinating Center (RCC), the Georgia Stroke Net brings an established infrastructure of highly successful and collaborative investigators and coordinators, with many years of proven expertise in designing, conducting, and enrolling patients into randomized clinical trials across the continuum of stroke care, from pre-hospital through rehabilitation. Our RCC will continue to implement research protocols using master trial agreements and a central IRB, and bring strong leadership skills, as evidenced by our team members’ commitment to ongoing and future participation in NIH Stroke Net working groups to critically review trials and new proposals to be implemented in the network. We plan to leverage existing and new opportunities to expand our referral base and increase detection and enrollment of eligible patients from a diverse background into NIH Stroke Net trials. This approach includes utilizing our local and regional relationships within networks of providers to identify potential research subjects. We will expand Georgia Stroke Net’s collaborative team of experienced investigators, recruiters, and evaluators and create synergy across multiple research resources that include direct and in-kind contributions. We plan to submit new clinical trial proposals to the NIH that build upon our team’s expertise in acute stroke, prevention, and recovery. Emory’s Georgia Stroke Net proposal builds upon our RCC’s track record of nearly 10 years of highly successful participation as an NIH Stroke Net site and a 30 year history of high enrollment in multiple NIH and industry sponsored practice changing randomized clinical trials in stroke."

To serve the primary mission of the Duke RBL, it is imperative that the facility itself operates to the highest
operational standards. The overall goal of this Aim is to ensure that we can maintain reliable and uninterrupted
facility functionality. To achieve this goal, we focus on several critical elements: the facility must be safely and
effectively operated through a functional and seamless management process, inculcating a culture of safety
that permeates throughout the entire organization; the systems that are vital to the operation of the facility must
be well-maintained, and where appropriate the scheduled replacement of key systems must be planned prior
to any likely systems failure (i.e. before the end of the lifespan of the system or equipment). Finally, and
consistent with the aforementioned culture of safety, it is essential that facility meets or exceeds all of the
regulatory standards that are required for all of our systems and equipment. The goals of this Facility
Management, Maintenance and Operations Core (Core 1) are to 1) provide expert management and oversight
of the BSL-3 space; 2) ensure proper preventative maintenance of all critical systems; and 3) ensure
continuous compliance with all applicable regulatory standards. This Core is foundational to the safe and

Opioid addiction is now the fastest growing drug problem in the United States. Chronic opioid use induces opioid dependence, which is characterized by extremely unpleasant physiological and psychological symptoms after drug use is terminated. Opioid users learn to associate opioid intake with relief from negative physical and affective states. These learned associations are major obstacles for successful addiction treatment, since even after a prolonged period of abstinence, re-exposure to such cues often triggers drug craving and relapse to drug seeking. Therefore, the neuronal circuits underlying opioid withdrawal might be a potent target for preventing relapse. Indeed, we recently revealed an essential role of the paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway in mediating opioid withdrawal symptoms. Repeated opioid exposure causes long-term potentiation in the PVT→NAc pathway, furthermore silencing of this pathway disrupts opioid-associated memory and causes enduring protection against relapse to opioid use. However, PVT and NAc are both functional heterogenous structures with complex anatomical connections with their up- and down- stream brain regions. Beside opioid addiction, the PVT→NAc pathway also regulates motivated behaviors, such as feeding and sleep. Different functions are likely mediated by distinct subgroup of neurons in this pathway. We thus have formed a team with strong expertise in epigenomics sequencing, spatial imaging technologies, and neurobiology of drug addiction. We propose to (1) combine single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic imaging to establish a spatial resolved single cell atlas in the PVT and NAc; (2) identify opioid-responsive cell types and opioid-induced changes in their chromatin accessibility and gene expression during different stages of opioid addiction in the PVT; (3) use cell type specific gene manipulation to determine the contribution of opioid-induced gene expression changes to behavioral adaptations caused by repetitive opioid exposure and withdrawal. Together, our results will help identify novel molecular targets for treating opioid addiction."

The aim of this proposal is to plan for and deliver a proof-of-concept solution for an innovative
and easy-to-use experimental platform for measuring and quantifying social behaviors in animal
models. Efforts during this initial grant period will be restricted to rats and mice, experimental
animals with rich social behaviors, but we hope in future iterations of this program to expand also
to other model organisms, including birds and monkeys. To capture kinematic details of whole-
body movement during social behaviors requires novel solutions for dealing with the inevitable
occlusions that results from social interactions. To overcome the limitations of current approaches
we will build and validate a novel deep neural network that learns to combine images across
multiple synchronized cameras and infer the 3D physical coordinates of multiple animals.
Preliminary studies have been very positive and suggest large improvements over current
methods both when it comes to the range of social behaviors that can be tracked and the precision
with which they can be measured. Importantly, all new technology will be readily shared with the
scientific community, thereby leveraging from this single grant the potential for numerous
investigators to dramatically improve the efficiency of their research programs requiring rigorous
quantitative descriptions of animal behavior."

Health information is siloed and often suffers from the sheer volume and the heterogeneous nature of complex
datasets. This is in stark contrast to what a physician does when a patient is evaluated. Data from electronic
health records, blood tests, imaging, electrical recordings, genomic studies, and neuropsychological measures
are combined in the clinician’s mind to find the best diagnosis and treatment plan. Nowhere is this more
challenging than for studies of the human brain. We have developed a one-of-a-kind human brain tissue bank
where each brain sample is spatially linked to a comprehensive multimodal dataset using standardized tissue
processing techniques using a home-grown software platform called INTUITION. Highly curated and integrated
data are assembled from patients to help both in clinical care and provide a unique research platform for the
human brain that is linked to fresh human brain tissues samples. Many patients undergo complex, multistep
brain surgeries to treat their seizures. Studies using these standardized tissue methods and INTUITION software
have already led to important new discoveries including molecular (genomic, proteomic, metabolomic)
biomarkers, imaging methods, brain network discovery, and therapeutic targets that would otherwise not have
been identified. The major goals for this collaborative innovation award are to adapt, modify, and expand
INTUITION and a brain tissue collection educational program into a standardized, virtual tissue bank and
federated data platform for dissemination through 3 CTSA hubs with teams at 5 collaborating institutions in the
city of Chicago. The platform leverages common data elements and will use a team of experts to develop new
ones. As part of this ambitious project, we will optimize brain image visualization and EEG tools, work with a
highly diverse patient population that spans the age spectrum (pediatric and adult) and develop user-friendly
tools that will be sustainable because of their combined utility for clinical care and research. Given the
extraordinary value of highly curated fresh human brain tissues and the fact that brain surgeries are becoming
less invasive, it is important that we take full advantage of these priceless tissues as soon as possible. We will
develop a hands-on education program followed by web-based training modules for human brain tissue
localization and processing in parallel with standardized data processing, storage and upload methods for
images and EEG studies at each of the 5 sites. This is especially important for rare brain disorders that require
collaboration from many centers to create a standardized, virtual pool of tissue samples and associated data."
10786519,"Abstract
Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the end stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and can be an underlying
cause of ischemic rest pain, gangrene, and amputation. Primary amputation is often required for the 30% of
CLI patients who are not eligible for limb revascularization; thus, an effective therapy to improve
neovascularization is urgently needed. During hindlimb ischemia, monocytes are among the first cells to hone
in on the ischemia site and contribute to neovascularization. Our recent publication revealed that ischemia
training, performed by 24 hours of unilateral femoral artery ligation, led to functional reprogramming of bone
marrow-derived monocytes (BM-Mono), enabling them to protect against the outcomes of limb ischemia by
increasing perfusion and neovascularization. Mechanistically, this reprogramming resulted in the
downregulation of 24-Dehydrocholesterol Reductase (Dhcr24, an important enzyme that converts
desmosterol into cholesterol), and a consequent accumulation of desmosterol in those cells. Interestingly,
our preliminary data have shown that ischemic-trained monocytes control vascular proliferation, and both
vascular cell types, endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), have increased expression of IL-
10 and its receptors. Moreover, the macrophages differentiated from the ischemic-trained monocytes
possess an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Here our primary scientific goal is to target Dhcr24 in monocytes
as a novel and unique strategy to improve neovascularization in the setting of PAD/CLI. First, we will assess
whether downregulation of Dhcr24 in BM-Mono improves hindlimb ischemia outcomes, such as perfusion and
neovascularization; and second, we will identify the mechanisms by which those BM-Mono with low Dhcr24
expression control vascular proliferation. Our long-term goal is to translate these findings using a Dhcr24
inhibitor into a new therapeutic approach to treat PAD/CLI. We hypothesize that the low expression of
Dhcr24 in BM-Mono regulates anti-inflammatory pathways in vascular cells that controls their proliferation,
leading to a proper neovascularization in the ischemic limb. We will test our hypothesis in two specific aims.
SA1: Determine whether monocyte Dhcr24 regulation alters hindlimb ischemia outcomes.
We will determine the dependence of loss- or gain-of-function of monocyte Dhcr24 on limb perfusion,
function, and neovascularization using a pre-clinical model of hindlimb ischemia. We expect to demonstrate
that low expression of Dhcr24 in BM-Mono plays a beneficial role against hindlimb ischemia.
SA2: Identify the mechanism by which monocytes with low Dhcr24 control vascular proliferation We
will dissect the underlying mechanisms by which monocytes with low Dhcr24 expression regulate vascular
proliferation. We will also inhibit Dhcr24 in human monocytes and assess their inflammatory phenotype. We
expect to find that the underlying mechanisms are based on anti-inflammatory pathways."
10788820,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This R03 proposal aims to explore the multilevel determinants of the implementation of prenatal syphilis
screening policies into clinical practice among obstetric providers. Professional organizations have endorsed
evidence-based guidelines (“guidelines”) to screen for syphilis at prenatal visits and reduce the burden of these
infections, but states can also regulate their own screening requirements through legislation and policies
(“policies”). The guidelines and policies are inconsistent and differ widely in their scope, populations of focus,
recommended timing of screening, and determinants of risk (ACOG, 2017; Curry et al., 2018; Workowski et al.,
2021). To identify leverage points and enact systems-level change, exploring the multi-level factors influencing
implementation of these prenatal syphilis guidelines and policies into obstetric care is essential. The long-term
goal is to increase rates of syphilis screening at prenatal visits, thus reducing the rates of congenital syphilis in
Texas. The objective is to identify implementation strategies for obstetric providers to facilitate the prenatal
syphilis screening policies into clinical care. This study will align with the steps of Implementation Mapping, and
we will form a Planning Board (n=10) comprised of obstetric providers across various practice settings
(physicians, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, registered nurses), hospital management, clinic administrators,
and prenatal patients. The Planning Board will participate in all study aims (Fernandez, 2019). Aim 1: Assess
the multilevel determinants of prenatal syphilis screening policy implementation. Guided by the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al., 2009), in-depth interviews will be
conducted with obstetric providers, hospital/clinic administrators, and prenatal patients in Texas (n=45; Task 1
of Implementation Mapping). The multilevel determinants, barriers, and facilitators to implementation of syphilis
screening policies into clinical care will be assessed. Aim 2. Develop a multilevel prenatal syphilis screening
policy implementation strategy. Using a modified Delphi approach, the Planning Board will develop a logic
model of change, expected outcomes, performance objectives, and matrices of change (Task 2 of
Implementation Mapping). The Planning Board will choose theory and/or evidence-based methods to influence
the identified determinants and subsequently select implementation strategies to operationalize those methods
based on Powell's compilation of implementation strategies (Task 3 of Implementation Mapping). This project will
enhance knowledge of contextual and systems-level determinants influencing obstetric providers practice
behaviors and hospital management decision-making. It will also provide information on implementation of
syphilis policies in Texas - the state with the highest congenital syphilis rates in the country. Upon preliminary
development of a multilevel implementation strategy, the research team will submit an implementation science-
focused R01 during Year 2 to complete Tasks 4-5 of Implementation Mapping, including experimentally testing
the proposed strategy through a hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation study design."
10792866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness, impacting 79.6 million worldwide 1. This blindness results
from the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and is primarily linked to chronic ocular hypertension (OHT).
Because of gaps in our understanding of the molecular pathways linking OHT with RGC loss, the only current
clinical strategy to slow glaucoma progression is to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). This strategy has serious
limitations as it does not stop the disease and has a high proportion of non-responders 2.
Elevation of IOP varies in magnitude and disrupts RGCs in several ways. High elevation (above systolic blood
pressure) causes an acute and severe ischemic injury in these neurons, more common in closed-angle
glaucoma, while lower magnitude chronic IOP elevations affect them slowly over time. Acute ischemic injury is
similar to a stroke that activates pressure-sensitive calcium channels, induces oxidative and ER stresses, ATP
release via activated Panx1/Cx hemichannels, and obstructs axonal transport3. More recent studies have
revealed that the activation of the endogenous inflammasome and subsequent formation of GasderminD pores
is a primary mechanism in neuronal dysfunction and pyroptotic death in ischemic OHT injury models 4, 5. In
contrast, episodes of sub-ischemic low level but chronic IOP elevations can cause glaucoma despite being non-
injurious short term6. In addition to these two modalities, rapid IOP elevation “spikes” below ischemic levels have
been shown to induce RGC dysfunction and glaucomatous degeneration in both human and rodent eyes7, 8. In
people, such pressure spikes can be induced by surgery and drugs and by activities such as eye rubbing, playing
wind instruments, head down exercising, heavy weight lifting, and frequent caffeine intake, which have been
linked to higher glaucoma risk2. However, the mechanisms causing RGC injury by such relatively low amplitude
but rapid and recurring spiking IOP fluctuations are poorly understood.
In this project, I utilize a model of sub-ischemic OHT spikes (SIOHS) to investigate early RGC-damaging
pathways and their role in glaucomatous RGC degeneration. My main focus is on the mechanism linking mild
acute stress by sub-ischemic OHT spikes with the functional deficit and RGC loss. In this project, I will test the
hypothesis that overactivation of mechanosensitive channels on the cell surface of RGCs challenged by IOP
spikes initiates metabolic stress and eventual loss via the activity of endogenous inflammasome.
To examine this, I will determine 1. the role of endogenous neuroinflammation in RGC dysfunction and death
following SIOHS, and 2. Test if cell surface TLRPV4 receptor signaling pathway is specifically responsive to
SIOHS events."

10790643,"The goal of the project is to identify pre-diagnosis plasma biomarkers for AMD, i.e., markers that can be
measured in plasma samples from healthy donors and may predict which donors will get AMD in the following
years. We will use approx.150 plasma samples collected and stored at the Biome MSSM Biorepository, from
healthy, non-AMD donors, which eventually became diagnosed with AMD 2-8 years after the blood donation.
These samples will be compared to samples from donors that did not develop AMD after a similar number of
years. We will use two strategies. The first strategy (Aim 1) consists of analyzing the protein composition of
plasma samples using the SOMAscan platform, which allows quantitation of approx. 7000 proteins. In addition,
we will investigate whether pre-diagnostic differences exist in the optical spectra generated by Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Aim 2 is based on the hypothesis that some post-diagnostic biomarkers, shown
by published studies to robustly differentiate healthy donors from AMD patients, reflect differences that pre-exist
years before the donors are diagnosed. We will investigate, using the BioMe plasma samples, whether the
differences exist years before the disease develops. As most BioMe donors have been fully genotyped, genetic
information will be also included in the effort to find pre-diagnostic biomarkers. Regarding the potential impact of
the study, a large-scale effort is underway for years to find dietary supplements and other agents that could
prevent AMD. Such studies involve administration for years of supplements to relatively large numbers of
subjects that do not have yet AMD and waiting for years to determine if the proportion of persons that develop
the disease is reduced. Development of predictive biomarkers could enormously simplify such efforts, by
assessing the immediate effect of the supplements on the biomarkers. At the level of individual subjects, if
protective interventions are found, the pre-diagnostic markers will help detect the persons for which the
interventions are necessary."
10790858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malaria causes high morbidity and mortality globally with 247 million cases and 619,000 deaths in 2021, >90%
of which occurred in children living in sub-Saharan Africa. Children who survive repeated episodes of
symptomatic malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite still do not thrive. Repeated malaria
exposures eventually confer clinical immunity whereby these children can be “asymptomatically” infected with
the parasite. These asymptomatic P. falciparum infections, while not clinically apparent, have significant
individual and public health consequences, including chronic anemia, increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis,
and maintenance of onward malaria transmission by serving as parasite reservoirs. Prior studies suggest that
asymptomatic infections can also adversely impact cognitive performance in school-aged children. In
asymptomatic malaria infections, parasite density directly correlates with markers of systemic inflammation.
Systemic inflammation, as measured by circulating inflammatory cytokines, has been proposed to
mechanistically alter brain development. Despite the potential mechanistic links, it remains unknown whether
systemic inflammation mediates the relationship between asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and cognitive
performance. Based on this prior evidence and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that 1) asymptomatic P.
falciparum parasitemia reduces cognitive performance; 2) treatment of microscopy-detectable asymptomatic
parasitemia can reverse such reductions in cognition; and 3) subclinical inflammation, as measured by pro-
inflammatory plasma cytokines, partially mediates the effect asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia on
cognitive performance in young schoolchildren. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a 10-week
interventional trial in asymptomatic children aged 7-9 years (n=300, 50% female) residing in western Kenya
whereby those with microscopy-positive P. falciparum parasitemia are treated at baseline. Parasitemia,
hemoglobin, plasma cytokines, plasma metabolites, and inflammatory markers will be measured at baseline and
at follow-up. Successful completion of this project will determine whether treatment of asymptomatic P.
falciparum infections leads to improvements in cognitive performance and whether systemic inflammation
mediates this relationship. Understanding these relationships is essential for developing public health programs
that reduce the impact of malaria and its sequelae."
10792558,"Abstract
The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of rare, dominantly inherited
neurological disorders characterized by progressive ataxia. Although the genetic causes of SCAs are diverse,
multiple SCAs (1,2,3,6,7 & 12) are caused by CAG expansion mutations and they share the production of CAG
expansion RNAs and in most cases, the expression of toxic polyglutamine containing proteins. Despite these
shared features, there are no cross-disease therapeutic approaches for these disorders, and we lack a clear
understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for disease pathogenesis. Our central
hypothesis is that targeting CAG expansions with small molecules will provide therapeutic efficacy across
multiple SCAs. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged our extensive experience from developing small molecules
that target CUG expansion RNAs in myotonic dystrophy (DM). We generated a CAG expansion reporter cell line
with an integrated (CAG)60 lacking genomic context of any SCA gene. Using this cell line, we have identified
small molecules that selectively reduce levels of CAG transcripts across SCA1, SCA3 and SCA7 patient-derived
fibroblasts and SCA1 mice providing proof-of-concept for a cross-disease small molecule approach for CAG
expansion SCAs. In this study, we will leverage our CAG screening system and established pipeline to identify
FDA-approved small molecules and natural products with therapeutic efficacy across CAG SCAs. Interestingly,
transcriptomic characterization of our CAG reporter line identified gene expression signatures that are also found
in SCA mouse models, as well as widespread alternative splicing dysregulation. Changes in alternative splicing
are a molecular feature for many repeat expansion diseases including DM, suggesting alternative splicing may
be a novel CAG-dependent transcriptomic hallmark of SCAs. Indeed, we identified widespread alternative
splicing in SCA patient-derived fibroblasts and published RNA-Seq data from across CAG SCA mouse models,
including presymptomatic animals. In DM, specific mis-spliced events are directly connected with disease
outcomes and can be used as target engagement biomarkers for lead candidate prioritization in preclinical
therapy studies. We propose that dysregulation of alternative splicing provides a missing link between
presymptomatic transcriptional changes and dysregulation of key cellular pathways in CAG expansion SCAs. To
address this, we propose to identify alternative splicing events that contribute to disease onset and neuronal
dysfunction in the human neuronal context and to assess the feasibility of measuring alternative splicing
dysregulation and rescue to aid in cross CAG SCA lead compound prioritization. Together these studies will
identify novel, clinic-ready CAG selective compounds and will help to accelerate these compounds towards
clinical testing as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets that may serve as the basis for future investigations.
This work will have broad implications for therapeutic development and our understanding of disease across
CAG SCAs, non-CAG SCAs, CAG repeat diseases and the broad class of microsatellite expansion disorders."

Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive malignant primary bone cancer with a high propensity for lung metastasis.
Since the development of aggressive chemotherapy and surgery, the 5-year event-free survival rate for non-
metastatic patients has attained 70%. In contrast, the outcome for pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma (pOS)
remains poor and the 5-year event-free survival has not improved significantly over the past 3 decades (20%).
Therefore, treating pOS effectively remains a challenge. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the most
potent immune suppressive cytokines in tumor microenvironment (TME) and can promote metastasis in solid
tumors. TGF-β production is increased in the sera of OS patients. This increase in TGF-β production is correlated
with high grade OS and associated with the presence of lung metastases. Therefore, target TGF-β is the new
therapeutic approach for the treatment of OS. In this proposal, we will demonstrate the therapeutic effects of a
novel inhibitor of TGF-β signaling, TEW-7197, on OS growth in vitro and in vivo and associated immune
responses in the OS TME. TEW-7197 (“Vactosertib”) is the first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-β
type I Receptor (TβRI) kinase and currently in Phase I clinical trial at UH Seidman Cancer Center for Multiple
Myeloma, another disease with high TGF-β (#NCT03143985). TEW-7197 is orally available (taken qD or BID)
and well tolerated with minimal side effects. Our preliminary data show that blocking TGF-β signaling with TEW-
7197 inhibited OS proliferation in vitro and oral administration of TEW-7197 to OS-bearing mice significantly
reduced established pOS in vivo. Our preliminary observation has resulted in an Orphan Drug Designation
authorization by the FDA in August 2021 as well as Fast-track IND issuance in January 2023 for the use of TEW-
7197 in OS. More recently, a multi-center phase I/II clinical trial using Vactosertib as monotherapy for the
treatment of advanced osteosarcoma in patients age 14 and up been organized and planned for accrual in spring
2023 (#NCT05588648) at 21 sites across US, Europe and Asia. Recently, we have made the additional
observation that TGF-β induced c-Myc expression in OS cells and those inductions were completely inhibited by
TEW-7197 in OS cells. c-Myc is a major proto-oncogene which is highly amplified in OS. c-Myc overexpression
in human OS correlates with aggressive tumor cell invasion and metastasis and worsens overall patient clinical
prognosis. Therefore, these new results suggest that c-Myc regulation by TGF-β may be an important therapeutic
target in OS. We hypothesize that TGF-β signaling inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy against
metastatic pOS by modifying tumor-intrinsic signaling (c-Myc regulation) and extrinsic immune-related TME to
achieve optimal immune-effector function and maximal clinical response in pOS. To confirm this hypothesis, we
will utilize various mouse and human OS cell lines and PDX models in vitro and in vivo. Two specific aims will
be pursued to accomplish the overall objective. Specific aim 1 will Determine effects of TGF-β inhibition on c-
Myc regulation in OS cells in vitro. Specific aim 2 will Determine whether daily oral administration of TEW-7197
suppresses pOS tumor progression in the syngeneic and humanized mouse models. A fully humanized mouse
model will be employed to interrogate TEW-7197 effects on cellular immune responses with preclinical human
OS TME in vivo. This research will establish a critical role of TGF-β signaling in pOS progression and provide
scientific rationale that targeting TGF-β signaling with orally available small molecule inhibitor should be
developed as a viable therapeutic arsenal for pOS patients."

Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a chronic, disabling central nervous system disorder of hypersomnolence that
typically begins in adolescence. Progress in understanding IH pathophysiology and identifying effective
treatments is stymied by the commonly used diagnostic test, the multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). This
test is very reliable in classic narcolepsy but has poor validity and reliability in people with IH. In addition to this
poor clinical performance, the current diagnostic use of the MSLT also hinders clinical trials by enrollment of
clinically heterogeneous IH cohorts with more variable outcomes. Thus, there is a critical need to develop and
validate an objective IH biomarker signature to improve diagnostic accuracy. The most striking IH features
occur in the nocturnal sleep period. Most IH patients report non-restorative sleep and profound difficulty waking
from sleep in the morning despite normal to long sleep durations. In our prior work, we showed IH is
characterized by shorter (less stable) bouts of NREM 3 (N3) sleep (the most restorative sleep stage), longer
bouts of less refreshing NREM 2 (N2) sleep, long sleep times, and high sleep efficiency. These findings may
reflect proposed mechanisms of IH including heightened GABA receptor potentiation or prolonged circadian
period. As a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in modeling neurophysiological processes, biomarker
discovery, statistics, and hypersomnia disorders, we hypothesize that measures of nocturnal sleep
stability will define the IH signature and more accurately identify IH than the current MSLT method. In
the R61 grant, our objectives are to: (Aim 1) identify nocturnal sleep features of hypersomnia patients using
polysomnograms retained in the National Sleep Research Resource; (Aim 2) develop and test a sleep
biomarker signature from polysomnogram signals (IH signature) for IH diagnosis in a clinical population across
5 sites using current diagnostic criteria and cutoff scores on validated IH symptom scales as the “gold
standard” IH classification. In meeting our robust “go criteria” showing high sensitivity and specificity of our IH
signature for IH diagnosis, we will proceed with the R33 phase. In this next grant phase, we will validate the IH
signature in a separate and new clinical cohort of patients (Aim 3) and test the reliability of the IH signature
(Aim 4). Through this work, we will identify an accurate and stable biomarker signature that will provide more
accurate diagnosis of IH using nocturnal PSG testing. This will improve diagnostic certainty in the clinic and
reduce clinical heterogeneity for research, enabling study of underlying causal mechanisms and future drug
development."

Mitochondrial function declines during aging and is accelerated in age-associated diseases such as
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Thus, understanding how cells and organisms generate the appropriate
mitochondrial mass during development and maintain that mitochondrial network during aging is an essential
step to limiting pathologies associated with loss of mitochondrial function. Here, we aim to understand the
underlying mechanisms by which the transcription factor ATFS-1 and the mitochondrial unfolded protein
response (UPRmt) coordinate mitochondrial network biogenesis during normal development and the recovery
of the mitochondrial network via independently regulated functions of ATFS-1 in mitochondrial compartments
and the nucleus.
 Numerous components have been identified that promote replication of the mitochondrial genome and
transcription of nuclear-encoded genes that result in mitochondrial biogenesis. However, it remains unclear
how the appropriate amount of mitochondrial mass is achieved during development or cell specification, and
how the mitochondrial network is maintained over a cell or organisms lifetime. It also remains unknown if
mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) replication is coordinated with cell growth, physiology, or functional
heterogeneity within the compartments that comprise the mitochondrial network. Current dogma suggests that
mtDNA replication is entirely dependent on expression of several nuclear-encoded factors such as the mtDNA
polymerase. Despite functional heterogeneity within the mitochondrial network, compartment-specific
autonomy over mtDNA regulation is rarely considered.
 In this proposal, we aim to understand how ATFS-1 establishes the appropriate amount mitochondrial
mass during development, and maintains the mitochondrial network over an animals lifetime focusing on the
separate activities of nuclear ATFS-1, and the fraction of ATFS-1 that accumulates in dysfunctional
mitochondria and binds mtDNA. Lastly, we aim to understand the impact of an ATFS-1-mediated diapause that
occurs if the mitochondrial network is severely damaged during development. At the end of the funding period,
we hope to understand the endogenous strategies in place to establish and maintain the mitochondrial
network, to potentially develop strategies to promote or maintain a robust mitochondrial network."

 Age-related hearing loss is exceedingly common, with an estimated 60% of individuals over 70 years of
age having hearing loss significant enough to interfere with communication and affect quality of life. However,
increasing evidence suggests that the overt loss of hearing thresholds alone fails to capture real-world hearing
difficulties experienced by older adults. One hitherto undiagnosed cause of hearing deficits could be the
progressive loss of synapses between the inner hair cell and the auditory nerve with age, termed cochlear
synaptopathy. Cochlear synaptopathy is thought to affect speech intelligibility under complex listening conditions,
yet it goes undetected by the threshold audiogram, remaining ‘hidden’. While the functional consequences of
cochlear synaptopathy are still unclear, emerging evidence suggests that it is associated with deficits in
representation of timing cues in the auditory periphery. This may differentially affect the encoding of rapid
stimulus temporal fine structure (sTFS) cues in speech, which are critical for listening in noisy conditions.
 Establishing the effects of cochlear synaptopathy on decreased speech-in-noise intelligibility cannot be
accomplished in a single species. Perceptual deficits observed in humans cannot be attributed directly to
cochlear synaptopathy, because anatomical synaptopathy is only verifiable in post-mortem specimens. Rodent
models offer the means to directly measure cochlear synaptic integrity but are limited in their potential to serve
as models of human speech perception under real-world settings. This proposal addresses these translational
challenges by integrating research in humans and animal models, with non-invasive electrophysiological
responses measured under near identical conditions in both humans and animal models acting as the
translational bridge. Experiments in Aim 1 will use a battery of behavioral and electrophysiological methods in
humans to test the hypothesis that degradations in speech-in-noise intelligibility with age are accompanied by
altered neural coding of sTFS cues. In Aim 2, the role of age-related cochlear synaptopathy in degraded sTFS
processing will be studied in an animal model whose hearing range is sensitive to human speech frequencies,
using the electrophysiological biomarkers of sTFS processing validated in humans. Aim 3 will isolate
contributions of cochlear synaptopathy to the neural coding of sTFS cues from possible confounding age-related
effects by inducing graded synaptopathy in young animals and evaluating the same electrophysiological and
immunohistological markers used in Aim 2. The completion of this project has the potential to result in a single
biomarker that links cochlear synaptopathy to deficits in speech-in-noise intelligibility. The project will further
establish an integrated research pipeline that can accelerate the translation of pre-clinical studies to early human
trials for future biomarkers or interventional therapies. Finally, the data obtained here will form the basis for future
studies that will follow this translational approach to explore the interactions between age-related cochlear
synaptopathy, peripheral threshold sensitivity, and compensatory plasticity in the central auditory pathway."

The distribution of disease and death from the COVID-19 pandemic has been grossly unequal in every
dimension. The vaccination campaign, throughout Winter and Spring 2021, has seen these inequities repeated.
Lower-risk, wealthier, and Whiter individuals have received earlier access to vaccination than their counterparts.
To those viewing the pandemic through the theoretical lens of social epidemiology and medical sociology, the
extremity and nature of these disparities was easily anticipated. However, the predictive and dynamic systems
models that have guided the domestic and global COVID-19 response have routinely ignored the social
determinants of infection and its outcomes. The objective of this application is to outline a multi-level approach
to infectious disease transmission modeling and data analysis that places the social determinants of exposure,
severe disease and mortality on an equal footing with the biological features of transmission and disease
progression. Our overarching goal is to develop a set of tools that will extend lessons from the COVID-19
pandemic to prevent similar disparities in future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. The first aim of this
project will develop and analyze transmission models that integrate the joint social and biological drivers of
infection disparities. This proposed work will identify etiologic factors driving disparities in infection risk, and
propose policy-relevant alternative approaches to measuring infection disparities. Our second aim will evaluate
the sensitivity of population-based prospective and observational study designs to socioeconomic disparities in
infection risk and outcomes. We will use simulation studies with input parameters derived from the analysis of
detailed SARS-CoV-2 case data to understand the circumstances under which these study designs obscure key
dimensions of disparity. The third aim will assess long-term effects of vaccination policies, behavior, and
interventions on population-level infection inequalities. As the COVID-19 vaccination campaign has progressed
it has become clear that vaccine hesitancy and vaccine access are dual threats to achieving substantial levels
of population immunity. We will integrate survey data on vaccine hesitancy with data on healthcare access and
SARS-CoV-2 incidence to parameterize a spatial transmission model highlighting inequity in risks and avenues
for closing these gaps for COVID-19 and other vaccine preventable diseases. Taken together, the proposed
projects will lay the foundation systems modeling tools that can be used to promote equity in future epidemic
and pandemic responses."
10799847,"Abstract. DNA-targeting drugs are a mainstream therapy for cancer, but it is becoming clearer that some of their
anti-cancer activity is due not only to DNA damage, but also chromatin decondensation, which we call chromatin
damage (CD). Moreover, it has been shown that some drugs cause only CD without DNA damage, and these
""CD-only"" drugs are as potent anti-cancer drugs as compounds causing both CD and DNA damage, but lack the
toxicity associated with DNA damage. The focus of our study is to understand how CD activates IFN, and how
this property can be used in the clinic to gauge the potency of CD drugs. Our ultimate goal of our research is to
show that CD is a superior mechanism to DNA damage for the next generation of anti-cancer chemotherapy,
which is more effective, less toxic, and more powerful in activating an anti-tumor immune response.
 To achieve this goal, we have developed a new group of ""CD-only"" chemicals, curaxins. The anti-cancer
activity of curaxin clinical lead, CBL0137, has been demonstrated in multiple mouse models. Phase I trial has
shown manageable toxicities and evidence of antitumor activity. These studies confirmed induction of IFN
signaling by CBL0137 in mice and humans. Notably, curaxins cause stronger and faster IFN induction than DNA
damaging agents, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and HDAC inhibitors. It is well established now that IFN
induction significantly improves their anti-cancer efficacy of DNA damaging therapy. CD causes IFN induction
via different mechanisms, but our data showed that IFN activation enhances anti-cancer efficacy of CD.
 Therefore, we propose that anti-cancer activity of CD agents is mediated in vivo via two complementary
mechanisms: direct killing of tumor cells and engagement of anti-tumor immune attack. This proposal focuses
on the hypothesis that IFN signaling in tumor and/or non-tumor cells is induced by CD via a mechanism different
from DNA damage and potentiates the anti-cancer activity of CD drugs.
 We will focus on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a challenging disease to treat due to its aggressive
behavior and lack of actionable targets. Our specific aims are: 1. Determine the impact of the IFN activation
in tumor and non-tumor cells on the anti-tumor activity of CD therapy. 2. Define the mechanisms of IFN
activation by CD agents. 3. Develop strategies for reversing the immune suppressive environment in
triple-negative breast cancer using CD agents."

Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer diagnosed worldwide and is also the
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women overall. While much progress has
been made in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, traditional chemotherapeutic
treatments can lead to the development of chemotherapeutic resistance and remains a major
challenge in overall patient outcomes. The activation of the Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) by
numerous endo- and xeno-biotics, including several chemotherapeutic drugs, is known to regulate
many of the metabolic pathways associated with drug metabolism and resistance. The long-term
goal is to understand the transcriptional and metabolic targets of PXR in human breast cancers,
and to apply this knowledge in their treatment in order to improve patient outcomes. The objective
of this application is to elucidate the effects of PXR expression and activation on the transcriptome
and phenotypic changes in human breast cancer cell lines. The central hypothesis, which is
formulated on PXRs known roles in drug metabolism in healthy and pathogenic tissues as well
as preliminary data, is that PXR activation increases xenobiotic metabolism via the induction of
Phase I and II enzymes, as well as Phase III transporters, in addition to alterations in the cell cycle
and apoptosis in breast cancer. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the
transcriptional and phenotypic alterations in response to PXR activation are identified,
pharmacological agents or regimes that interfere with these pathways could be developed to
decrease the chemoresistance of breast cancer. The objective of this project will be
accomplished by two specific aims: (1) Identify global gene expressions changes in human breast
cancers associated with pregnane x receptor expression and/or transcription factor activation. An
RNA-seq based approach will be used to identify changes to the transcriptome in response to
endogenous and exogenous PXR expression and activation. (2) Examine the effects of PXR
expression and activation in models of breast cancer on cell survival and chemoresistance. In-
vitro based assays examining the effects of PXR on various aspects of the cell cycle, survival,
apoptosis, and invasiveness will be utilized. This study is innovative because it shifts the focus
of PXRs roles from normal liver and intestinal drug metabolism in order to fill a large void in our
understanding of PXRs influence on breast cancer, and potentially in many other types of cancer
as well. The proposed project is significant because it will uncover genes and metabolic pathways
that are critical to the development of chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer, identifying
new potential therapeutic targets."

The introduction of the Pap test has led to significant reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in
the US. However, screening rates are suboptimal in many Asian American subgroups, and remain persistently
lower than rates in non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic women. Studies report that Korean
and Vietnamese American women, in particular, have among the lowest rates of screening compared to other
ethnic/racial groups. Multiple factors may contribute to non-screening among Asian American women.
Embarrassment, cost, lack of insurance or regular healthcare provider, lack of time, and language difficulties
are key barriers to screening in this population. Emerging technologies supporting self-sampling for human
papillomavirus (HPV) testing may offer a valuable, evidence-based strategy for empowering Asian American
women who have been resistant -- or unable -- to obtain clinic-based cervical cancer screening. National
guidelines now include primary HPV screening every 5 years as an appropriate cervical cancer screening
strategy. Because HPV self-sampling in non-clinical settings has comparable accuracy to HPV-testing on
clinician-obtained samples, self-collection may represent an important strategy for increasing screening rates
among underscreened populations. In the United States, the provision of self-sampling kits improved screening
rates among women with limited resources and was highly acceptable. Notably, women reported experiencing
less embarrassment with self-sampling, and some studies found it improved subsequent participation in clinic-
based screening. Although prior studies have demonstrated that HPV self-sampling can be feasibly offered in
low-resource community settings, not one study has focused on underserved Asian American women, despite
the fact that this population has among the lowest cervical cancer screening rates. Therefore, the goal of the
proposed project is to examine HPV self-sampling in a community-based study of 800 Asian American women.
Using a matched-pair design, 12 community sites (n=400 women) will receive our previously tested community
education program on cervical cancer screening plus navigation, along with HPV self-sampling kits; and 12
community sites (n=400) will receive our previously tested community education program plus navigation to
clinic-based screening. The aims of the proposed project are to: (1) Compare rates of providing a self-collected
sample vs. obtaining clinic-based screening among 800 Asian American women; (2) Examine mediators of
participation; and (3) Assess the relative cost-effectiveness of HPV self-sampling vs. clinic-based screening.
Demographics, social/cultural environment, and physical environment factors will be assessed at baseline, post-
intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Participation in self-sampling or clinic-based screening will be assessed at 6-
month follow-up. The proposed project will be the first large-scale study to evaluate HPV self-sampling among
underserved Asian American women. Study findings will inform future evidence-based programs designed to
enhance screening participation among Asian American women nationally."

Manifestations of enterovirus infections are variable, with several severe illnesses such as meningitis, acute
flaccid myelitis (AFM), myocarditis, and neonatal sepsis. Poliovirus vaccines are near perfect at preventing
severe illness by generating strong, circulating antibody responses. However, the polioviruses represent only
three of the more than 100 enteroviruses capable of causing human disease. Recently approved vaccines for
enterovirus A71 are demonstrating that other enterovirus diseases, in this case hand, foot, and mouth disease,
can be prevented by vaccination as well. Our previous work shows that monoclonal antibodies that cross-react
to all clades of enterovirus D68 can protect infected mice from AFM-like disease, and even treat disease after
onset. Rather than try to make 100 vaccines to cover each enterovirus, we propose to understand the qualities
of the human antibody response that could provide cross-reactive immunity across many enteroviruses. With
this knowledge, immunogens can be designed that preserve the B cell epitopes that stimulate cross-reactive
antibodies. We first aim to determine the degree of cross-reactivity of enterovirus antibody responses at a B cell
level. We will complement seroepidemiology studies of hundreds of healthy adults, looking to see what proportion
of them have naturally made antibody responses to the four species of enterovirus, with studies of stimulated
memory B cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell compartment. The latter will allow us to see how
many individual B cells in healthy adults produce antibodies that cross-react between enterovirus species, a
knowledge gap with no existing data. Second, we aim to determine the molecular details of enterovirus species
cross-reactivity using human mAbs. We will create human hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs), screening and selecting for mAbs that bind to multiple enteroviruses. Antigen-binding fragments of the
mAbs, in complex with virions from all immune-reactive enteroviruses, will be used for cryo-electron microscopy
studies to obtain atomic resolution maps of antibody epitopes, detailing at a molecular level the determinants of
cross-reactivity. Third, we aim to determine mechanisms of antibody action utilizing human primary cell infection
models. As we investigate which stage of the viral life cycle different mAbs disrupt to exert function, using ex
vivo differentiated human epithelial cell cultures will preserve the natural cell surface receptors used by viruses
during in vivo human infection. The knowledge gained from these studies will allow detailed understanding of
how cross-reactive antibodies bind to enteroviruses and how they function. In turn, the mAbs can be used to
functionally validate that candidate immunogens preserve these cross-reactive B cell epitopes. Finally, some
mAbs could later have potential for direct use in humans, either as prophylactic or therapeutic agents. This is an
especially important consideration for populations such as the immunocompromised, who may not be able to
generate strong antibody responses upon vaccination."

The overall goal of the current proposal is to develop a clinically useful predictor of PARP inhibitor (PARPi)
sensitivity/resistance to spare toxicities and cost for patients unlikely to derive benefit. Our hypothesis is that a
combined mutation and methylation analysis performed immediately before initiation of therapy will provide a
useful predictor of PARPi response. To test this hypothesis, our approach is to complete development of a
high throughput and quantitative methylation assay for key HR genes and refine our assays using banked
tumor tissues formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) neoplastic samples from phase II PARPi trials, then
test these assays using samples from 4 large phase III randomized controlled trials (RCT) in OC and BC that
employ three different PARPi. We propose three specific aims:
 Aim 1: Develop a clinical grade, quantitative methylation assay and a combined methylation and
 mutation assay (MMA) to define those BRCA wildtype cancers with best response to PARP inhibitors.
 Aim 2: Validate the combined HRR mutation and methylation assay (MMA) as a predictor of PARPi
response in 2 randomized controlled trials of recurrent breast and ovarian cancer.
Aim 3: Validate MMA as a predictor of PARPi response in 2 randomized controlled trials for primary
treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
Together, these studies will provide insight into mechanisms of PARPi sensitivity while developing a clinical
predictor for both breast and ovarian cancer, which could apply to other cancer types. These studies will lead
to more precise therapeutic application of PARP inhibitors, reducing toxicity and cost while maximizing patient
benefit."

The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) since its inception has been dedicated to addressing the health
needs of people of color, as well as underserved urban and rural populations both in Georgia and across the
nation. Embedded in the MSM mission is the improvement of the overall health and well-being of individuals
and communities; increasing the diversity of the medical, scientific, and public health workforce; and
addressing primary healthcare needs through programs in education, research, and service. The
MSM proposes a novel Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities (CTRHD) which comprises
seven integrated components, including four cores and three specific research projects. The Research
Capacity Core (RCC) will enhance our behavioral and population/ health services research and outreach
capabilities. The RCC will continue to leverage resources at other NIH-funded Centers, both in Georgia and
across the nation. The Investigator Development Core (IDC) will provide pilot funding with special emphasis on
minority health and health disparity projects from junior and early-stage investigators. In addition, the IDC will
coordinate with the Administrative Core (Admin Core) and the Community Engagement Core (CEC) to
continue to train basic scientists to engage in community engagement in multidisciplinary translational research
teams (MDTTs). The Admin Core/IDC/CEC will provide a robust mentoring plan and a range of supplementary
activities (seminars, grant application workshops/writing programs, and retreats) to ensure investigator
success. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will guide all CTRHD community engagement practices
and develop sustainable relationships with community partners based on the Morehouse Model. In addition,
the CEC will catalyze meaningful community-engaged research by offering consultation studios and
workshops. The RCC will assist in the management of a Mobile Health Unity (Mobile Health Equity Unit) and
coordinate with the CEC, IDC, full projects, and other MSM researchers. The following specific aims of the U54
CTRHD will be pursued as outlined: AIM 1: Enhance multidisciplinary health disparities research with
innovative approaches and support mechanisms through a restructured Research Capacity Core (RCC); AIM
2: Increase and prepare all investigators (especially early-stage researchers) to become extramurally -funded
health disparities researchers through IDC, CEC and RCC activities; and AIM 4: Expand the Community
Engagement Core (CEC) by fostering existing and strengthening new sustainable relationships with
community-based organizations (CBO), establishing a community network in rural Georgia."

In congruence with the mission of the NIMHD funded RCMI program, the Morehouse School of
Medicine (MSM) has continued to address health equity. In alignment with the MSM Strategic
Plan, the Administrative Core (Admin. Core) will develop and strengthen the research
infrastructure necessary to achieve this goal. The Admin. Core will continue to provide
coordination and logistical support for four Cores [Research Infrastructure Core (RIC),
Investigator Development Core (IDC), Community Engagement Core (CEC) and a Recruitment
Core], plus 3 research projects. It will also continue to support health equity related research,
intellectual activities (e.g., lectures and seminars), workshops and research retreats, while
continually broadening our community partnerships across Georgia through the initial fostering
of multidisciplinary translational teams (MDTT). This describes addressing all sides of health
disparities in a team-based structure ultimately leading to health equity. We will leverage the
U54 resources at hand, other MSM resources into rural communities to expand our program
impact into the rural communities using our MDTT concept of coordinated basic, clinical, and
community research. And we will develop structures so that other researchers can access this
platform bringing to bear all aspects of MSM’s capability on those communities. Thus, in this
cycle the U54 Admin. Core will be redesigned to provide oversight, coordination, support, and
logistics for the various cores to expand the CTRHD ability to emphasize cutting edge
translational research through MDTT’s in both our current urban communities as well as
expanding our reach into rural communities. This will be accomplished through further linking
MSM’s basic, clinical, and community researchers and research, and enhancing our ability to
build the next generation of health disparities researchers. The CTRHD will achieve the above
through the following aims and specific objectives: SA1: Support administrative and logistical
support to all CTRHD cores, projects, and oversight for all CTRHD activities and partnerships;
SA2: Supervise and evaluate the impact of the CTRHD and its cores for enhancing MSM’s
mission of health equity research; increasing productivity of investigators; and MSM’s overall
success in obtaining extramural research funding. SA3: Coordinate with the RCMI Coordinating
Center with other RCMI institutions, NIH/NIMHD and other NIH funded centers and programs
across Georgia (i.e., GaCTSA)."
10932309,"The goal of the Recruitment core is to increase the capacity of the Morehouse School of
Medicine (MSM) U54 Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities (CTRHD) to
support translational research and the development of Multidisciplinary Translational Teams

communities. To achieve this, having a strong Data Science infrastructure at MSM would be
critical. Thus, given a central goal of the CTRHD as outlined above, it has been identified that
additional in-house genomics and biomedical informatics expertise, with a translational research
background, at the faculty level is needed to enhance and maintain access to the required
informatics infrastructure to support the CTRHD. MSM is uniquely situated to address
inequalities in health and URM genomics training. MSM is one of two historically black medical
schools established in the twentieth century, with the purpose of training URM students to
become physicians, biomedical scientists, and public health professionals. Genomic research
has ushered in a new era in the science and praxis of preserving, restoring, and prolonging
human health; however, there is a paucity of diverse researchers and most of the studies to
date have focused on European ancestral populations. Genomics/multiomics research offers
tremendous challenges and opportunities for improving human health. To this end, the
Recruitment Core will pursue the following specific aims: Aim I: recruit two mid-career faculty, a
genetics/ genomics faculty and a biomedical informatician faculty to strengthen our informatics
infrastructure to support the goals of the CTRHD; Aim II: contribute to the Health disparities
research across disciplines by increasing and expanding MSM’s biomedical informatics capacity
and service in translational genomics and bioinformatics; Aim III: enhance biomedical
informatics support to basic, behavioral, and clinical researchers at MSM that will aid in the
transformation of our MSM Data Scientists; and, Aim IV: provide translational bioinformatics
support for projects, mentored research education, training and career development in minority
health and health disparities research. The proposed objectives meet MSM’s new priorities that
include becoming leaders in genomics and precision medicine, new partnerships with area
universities, local and national, to bolster education, catalyze and strengthen growth in areas of
omics, and sustainability."

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) remains a leading cause of infections, especially in
the outpatient setting where it is the primary cause of skin and soft tissue infections
(SSTI). S. aureus also is a commensal bacterium, known to colonize 25-40% of
humans and is therefore, part of the human microbiome. In the late 1990s, a new clonal
lineage emerged making S. aureus the source of epidemic proportions of community
associated infections across the lifespan, with an increased risk among African
American and indigenous children and older adults. Over time, the landscape of the
antibiotic resistance changed, likely due to multifactorial processes, including the
overprescribing of non β-lactam antibiotics (resistance to β-lactam class is the hall mark
of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA)).Two decades later, both non β-lactam S.
aureus (methicillin sensitive or MSSA) and MRSA have gained additional resistance to
other antibiotic classes, making S. aureus a multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and
one of the top antibiotic resistant germs causing severe illnesses nationally and
worldwide. While it has been well known that health disparities exist for MRSA, the
disparities seen with community originated forms of MDR S. aureus (and risk factors
associated with this strain) are different than those MDR S. aureus which originated
from hospital settings. Socioecological conditions play a role in the risks seen with
community-based infections. Our study proposes to use association mining of antibiotic
resistant phenotypes seen with S. aureus with spatial trend analyses to detect
transmission patterns over time and areas. Applying multi-level spatially relevant group-
based trajectory modeling will allow us to detect ‘subtle’ changes in MDR patterns that
occur over time, and delineate geographic areas associated with MDR patterns.
Results generated by this research will contribute to current the knowledge on
community-based S. aureus strains (the genotype and its associated phenotypes)
which cause SSTI and additionally, address the gap of identifying the factors
contributing to recurrence of these SSTI. Understanding strain specificity will serve as
the basis to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistant S. aureus infections in community
settings and help identify S. aureus antigenic determinants which potentially can serve
as staphylococcal vaccine candidates. This study has the potential to curb the upward
trajectory and increasing public health threat posed by this multi-drug resistant bacteria."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop novel tunable metformin (Met)-releasing injectable scaffolds to sustain its
local delivery and enhance regeneration of critical-sized craniofacial bone defects. Our group and others have recently
reported that Met, a low cost, first line FDA-approved antidiabetic biguanide stimulates osteogenic differentiation of
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from different tissues. Promising Met-releasing, cell-free formulations are being
studied to enhance bone regeneration. Despite their potential therapeutic value, bone tissue regeneration will rely mostly on
cellular responses within the host’s osseous defect. As a highly hydrophilic small cationic compound, Met intracellular
uptake and activity is facilitated by cell membrane organic cation transporters (OCTs) of the solute carrier 22A gene family.
This implies that to be repurposed as a predictable osteogenic agent, Met must first gain access into functional OCT-
expressing MSCs. We have found that OCT1 protein levels are highly expressed and functional in human MSCs derived
from bone marrow and dental pulp as well as in vascular endothelial cells. These novel observations suggest that in critical-
sized craniofacial bone defects, Met’s osteogenic action could be amplified by targeting not only resident OCT1-expressing
cells but transplanted OCT1-expressing dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), an easily accessible source of postnatal autogenous
stem cells. This premise is supported by our previous reports and preliminary data. We found that DPSCs seeded on Met-
containing calcium phosphate cement reinforced with the natural biopolymer chitosan (Met/CPCC) remained viable for up
to two weeks with a marked increase in osteogenic marker expression and mineral synthesis. Met also induced vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from DPSCs, and directly increased endothelial cell capillary tube formation in
vitro. Here, we plan to test the central hypothesis that when compared to cell-free Met-containing constructs, transplantation
of OCT1-expressing DPSCs encapsulated within tunable Met-releasing CPCC/alginate-fibrin hydrogel microfiber (MF)
injectable scaffolds significantly enhance tissue regeneration in critical-sized craniofacial bone defects. Three specific aims
will test the following hypotheses: (1) Met-induced osteogenic and angiogenic responses in DPSCs are OCT1-dependent,
(2) an injectable, two-stage Met delivery CPCC/MF degradable scaffold significantly increases the osteogenic potential of
encapsulated OCT1-expressing DPSCs in vitro, and (3) significantly enhances vascularized tissue regeneration in a pre-
clinical critical-sized craniofacial bone defect model. We envision this innovative project leading to tissue regenerative
platforms where other stem cells within degradable Met-releasing injectable scaffolds will benefit many patients in need of
oral, craniofacial, and orthopedic procedures."

 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a last resort procedure for patients with acute heart or lung
failure. The procedure carries signiﬁcant risk of brain injury, yet no brain monitoring is performed, partly due to
signiﬁcant risks of current neuroimaging technologies. Thus, the cause of these injuries, their relation with ECMO
settings, and how they can be prevented are unknown. A critical need exists for non-invasive techniques to mon-
itor brain physiology at the bedside for ECMO patients and for strategies to minimize brain injury. Our objective
is to develop a means to ﬁnd predictors of neurologic functional outcome based on severity of injury assessment
in ECMO patients that can potentially lead to individualized optimization of extracorporeal support and timely
neuroprotective interventions. To this end, we have carefully selected multi-modal monitoring techniques that
can quantify cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and neuronal health. To probe cerebral autoreg-
ulation based on microvascular blood ﬂow, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) will be used. Near-infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS) will provide blood oxygenation and volume information. Electroencephalogram (EEG) will
measure cortical electrical activity continuously, and evoked potentials (EPs) will measure the functionality of
subcortical nuclei in the brainstem and midbrain. We hypothesize that this combination will enable prediction of
functional outcome in patients undergoing ECMO. Furthermore, simultaneous measurements of hemodynamic
and electrophysiological parameters will provide a unique opportunity to investigate disruption of neurovascu-
lar coupling as an additional marker for brain injury. In Aim 1, we will construct several prediction models for
functional outcome based on multi-modal neuromonitoring parameters from ECMO patients and evaluate their
capabilities. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether our inter-hemispheric asymmetry measure of cerebral au-
toregulation, developed during preliminary studies, is a unique marker for ECMO by comparing patients with and
without ECMO treatment. In Aim 3, we will construct a new low-cost optical system and carefully validate against
established DCS and NIRS system. The new system will enable continuous monitoring for future multi-center
trials and multi-regional measurements.
 Successful completion of these aims will result in great advances in ECMO and neurology research by provid-
ing a comprehensive innovative non-invasive longitudinal monitoring tool. In terms of ECMO, this work lays the
foundation for using this tool to optimize ECMO settings and reduce the occurrence of brain injuries in critically-ill
patients. Broadly, this multi-modal tool can be used to understand how the brain functions in diseased states in
order to discover treatments to prevent and treat neurologic disorders."
10798138,"While immunotherapies have made strides in the treatment of other cancers, castrate resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) remains largely unresponsive, underscoring the need for novel approaches. One such approach relies
on the administration of autologous T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
that recognize specific tumor-associated antigens. Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is widely expressed in
prostate cancer and we have previously developed a CAR targeting PSCA that has potent in vivo efficacy. To
target bone metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), we propose to manipulate a specific subset of T cells, called γδ that
can be driven to the skeleton via systemic treatment with bisphosphonates such as zoledronate (ZOL) that is
clinically used to limit cancer-induced bone disease in men with bone mCRPC. Importantly, ZOL treatment
induces accumulation of phosphoantigens in tumor cells, which are detected by γδ T cells. Our preliminary
findings show that ZOL can enhance γδ T-cells' homing to bone where they can prevent cancer growth via
CAR and via endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. γδ CAR-T treatment, in presence or absence of
ZOL, can mitigate cancer-induced bone deterioration. Moreover, we found that soluble factors secreted by
bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can increase the cytotoxic potential of γδ CART cells.
Finally, we found that the choice of CAR structural and costimulatory moieties affects the phenotype and
fuction αβ and γδ T cells differentially, requiring the design of CARs optimized for γδ T cells. Based on these
preliminary findings we hypothesize that the homing and cytotoxic activity of γδ CAR-T cells for the
treatment of bone metastatic CRPC can be greatly enhanced through genetic, pharmacological, and
microenvironmental approaches. We will test our hypothesis by; 1) Defining the optimum γδ CAR-T design
that will significantly enhance CRPC cytotoxicity. We will test the biological implications of choosing alternative
CAR transmembrane and costimulatory domains, with a specific focus on their ability to modulate the
expression of cytokine receptors. We will also dissect the specific signaling pathways that can govern γδ CAR-
T cell persistence. Finally, we will identify the molecular signaling pathways triggered by CARs with different
costimulatory domains. 2) Determining if ZOL can drive γδ CAR-T recruitment and anti-bone mCRPC activity in
vivo. We will use xenograft and PDX models of bone mCRPC to characterize the bioavailability and therapeutic
efficacy of γδ CAR-T + ZOL; and an immunocompetent model to map sites of phosphoantigen accumulation.
3) Dissecting the reciprocal effects of γδ CAR-T on the bone mCRPC microenvironment. We will analyze the
impact of γδ CAR-T + ZOL treatment on the structure and physiology of the bone, and the effects of MSC on
the performance of γδ CAR-T cells in vivo. Based on the anticipated results, characterizing the specific
properties of the bone/tumor microenvironment will reveal novel insights thereby providing a strong rationale
for the translation of immunotherapies tailored to eliminate currently incurable bone mCRPC."
10798140,"Abstract
Calreticulin (CRT) is a calcium-binding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is important for the folding
of many N-linked glycoproteins. It is best known for its function in the assembly of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I (MHC-I) molecules, which present peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells for protective
immunity against cancers and infections. Recent studies show that somatic frameshift mutations that alter the
C-terminus of CRT are one class of driver mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). A 52 base-pair
deletion mutant CRTDel52 and a 5 base-pair insertion mutant CRTIns5 are recurrent mutations in essential
thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and post-ET myelofibrosis (MF). It is our overall
hypothesis that the changes to the sequence and charge of the C-terminal domains of CRT induced by the
mutations enable both megakaryocyte transformation and immune system evasion in MPN. Although
oncogenic transformation in megakaryocytes requires both mutated CRT and the thrombopoietin
receptor/myeloproliferative leukemia protein (Mpl), the molecular mechanisms of mutant CRT-mediated
constitutive activation of Mpl are unknown. CRT is known to be important for ER calcium storage and cellular
calcium signaling, but precisely how MPN mutations alter these processes is not understood. The human
MHC-I locus is highly polymorphic. While it is known that MPN-linked mutant CRTs are ineffectively
incorporated into the MHC-I peptide-loading complex (PLC), it is unknown whether MPN CRT mutants have
differential influences on the assembly of various MHC-I allotypes. Studies are proposed here to address these
gaps in knowledge. We present evidence that disulfide-linked dimers of CRTDel52 are important for Mpl
activation. The nature of CRTDel52 dimers and their complexes with Mpl will be elucidated using structural and
mutagenesis studies. The effects of CRT deficiency, haploinsufficiency and mutation upon cellular calcium
signaling will be examined. Based on the knowledge of variable dependencies on CRT for cell-surface
expression of MHC-I allotypes, we will examine whether MPN CRT mutants impair MHC class I assembly for
some allotypes, but alter assembly and peptide display for some other MHC-I allotypes. Such alterations could
be exploited for immunotherapeutic targeting of MPN. Finally, mutant CRT expression is also detectable in
blood monocytes of MPN patients, leading to predictions of alterations to antigen presenting cell (APC) calcium
signaling and phagocytosis, which will be examined. Taken together, these studies will further our
understanding of how mutations of a ubiquitous ER chaperone drive cell transformation, and influence the
fundamental immunological processes of antigen presentation and phagocytosis."

Congenital craniofacial anomalies are common and arise from cellular changes that cause aberrant tissue-level
alterations in shape. Though significant understanding of the gene regulatory networks that pattern craniofacial
development has been achieved, knowledge regarding the cellular and physical processes driving craniofacial
morphogenesis lags behind. A particular paucity of information exists on the cellular changes that drive specific
craniofacial dysmorphologies. In recent years, my laboratory has assembled a battery of tools and established
a network of collaborations to address the signaling control of physical aspects of morphogenesis. By generating
new live imaging platforms for the study of lip and secondary palate fusion, we have identified novel cellular
behaviors that contribute to this process. We have pursued a detailed understanding of the cellular mechanisms
of craniofrontonasal syndrome, a condition that we have learned results from aberrant cell segregation behavior
and resultant changes in tissue shape. We have established the first hiPSC model of a craniofacial condition,
allowing us to address questions of cellular morphogenesis in a human system for the first time. Here we propose
a series of new directions that focus on the cellular basis of craniofacial morphogenesis and how it goes wrong
in congenital craniofacial conditions. These include three main goals: 1) Understand the control of mesenchymal
cell movement in shaping craniofacial tissues 2) Elucidate mechanisms of craniofacial epithelial tissue fusion at
cellular and molecular resolution 3) Elaborate novel regulators of mammalian craniofacial morphogenesis by use
of cutting edge CRISPR/Cas9 methodology in a human craniofacial disease-biased mutagenesis approach.
Achieving these goals will drive understanding of basic principles of cellular morphogenesis in craniofacial
development and increasingly provide opportunities to adapt these principles toward therapeutic and tissue
engineering approaches to treat congenital craniofacial anomalies."

The fundamental goal of the proposed Washington University/Siteman Cancer Center
(WU/SCC) NCTN Lead Academic Participating Site UG1 is to 1) foster scientific leadership and
mentorship in the NCTN, 2) participate in the development of NCTN therapeutic, correlative,
and cancer control trials, and 3) maintain strong accrual to clinical trials across multiple disease
sites, including those that are molecularly driven and those for rare cancers. WU/SCC
investigators have a long history of enthusiastic participation in the former cooperative group
program and continue to play key roles in the current NCTN program, specifically the Alliance
for Clinical Trials in Oncology, ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and NRG Oncology.
WU/SCC will have 5 UG1 co-Principal Investigators comprising the senior leadership team
including Nancy L. Bartlett, MD (Professor, Medical Oncology), Benjamin Kozower, MD, MPH
(Professor, Thoracic Oncology), David G. Mutch, MD (Professor, Gynecologic Oncology),
Clifford Robinson, MD (Associate Professor, Radiation Oncology) and Barry A. Siegel, MD
(Professor, Radiology). The WU/SCC senior leadership team is composed of three legacy
members with extensive cooperative group and NCTN experience (Bartlett, Mutch and Siegel)
and two new members (Robinson and Kozower) with experience in NCTN trial development.
The entire leadership team is committed to providing guidance for an institution-wide NCTN
UG1. WU/SCC has consistently demonstrated robust accrual to NCTN trials, accruing 848
patients between March 2014 and August 2017. During this same interval, 535 patients had
biospecimens collected and 58 patients were accrued to advanced imaging studies. The
strength of the WU/SCC genomics, proteogenomics, and molecular imaging programs in
combination with the large institutional biorepositories position us to make significant and novel
contributions to the scientific mission of the NCTN. WU/SCC investigators remain highly
invested in NCTN translational and clinical research in AML, lymphoma, lung cancer, breast
cancer, sarcoma, uterine cancer, molecular imaging, and radiation oncology. In addition, our
large referral base and the substantial increase in new cancer cases seen at our center in the
last 5 years will enhance our ability to accrue patients to nearly all disease site protocols,
including rare tumors. This institution-wide UG1 will facilitate enhanced communication and
collaboration among disease-site, translational, and modality specialists and improve our
potential for contributions to the NCTN operation."

The Type 3 cytokine (IL-17 and IL-22) producing lymphocytes (T3L) are strategically located at the
mucocutaneous barrier tissues and serve as sentinels of tissue perturbations at the interface with the
outside world. Skin resident T3L develop in early life and perform dual function: Early life, they promote
tissue fitness by interacting with commensals to produce tonic IL-17; and throughout life, they defend
against pathogens by rapid secretion of IL-17 essential for recruitment of neutrophils to inflamed tissues
and fortifying the barrier tissues. Commensal dysbiosis by low dose antibiotics during early life of
animals (E15 for mice and 24-28 weeks of gestation in humans) can lead to aberrant IL-17 production and
is linked to metabolic dysfunctions observed in adults, including obesity. We discovered recently that a
subset of T3L in mice can sense the dietary cholesterol metabolites oxysterols to calibrate their function.
These cells arise immediately after birth in mice and they are the fastest (innate-like) lymphoid
responders to tissue perturbations. The recognition of oxysterols by T3L is mediated by the G protein-
coupled receptor GPR183, which is expressed by all T3L in mice and humans. Gpr183 has been
genetically linked to psoriasis, colitis and Type 1 diabetes susceptibility in humans. In mice, early life
skin T3L subset mediates IL-17-driven psoriatic responses downstream of Toll-like Receptor signaling in
keratinocytes. This function is diet-modulated and dependent on GPR183, with high cholesterol diet
leading to severe diseases, and conversely, vegetarian diet dampening IL-17 production and dramatically
moderating disease severity. This discovery is the first to identify potential sensors of immune
modulatory dietary metabolites on lymphocytes outside the gut. In humans T3L are known to be
important in psoriasis in adults, but almost nothing is known about them in early life immune system.
This gap in knowledge in large part exists because there is no systematic census of T3L and their
interacting partners in mucocutaneous tissues of children. This proposal will fill this gap using innovative,
unbiased, complementary single cell interrogation methods to catalogue all immune cell types and states
in the skin of children from infancy to adulthood, stratified multi-parametrically, including BMI, dietary
habits and infection history. The skin cell atlas of children will be instrumental in establishing correlation
between dietary habits and propensity towards hyper inflammatory responses, modulated by skin-resident
T3L. The genome-wide information rich map will identify gene networks that govern intercellular
communications and cell lineage diversification, setting a major precedent of tissue immune systems
relevant for childhood immunity, and accelerate progress towards defining mechanisms of early life
immune system development."
10798350,"Modern biotechnologies have revolutionized human genomics, allowing researchers to query across the ~3.2
billion nucleotide base positions that form the human genome. The ability to detect genetic variants in a high-
throughput manner has revealed specific alleles that contribute to human phenotypic variation, including those
associated with disease risk. However, the vast majority of studies have focus exclusively on the portion of the
genome located in the nucleus. Largely ignored is the DNA contained in the cell's mitochondria (mtDNA), which
harbors the genes encoding proteins that are responsible for generating most of the cell's energy. Importantly,
the large and variable numbers of mitochondrial chromosome copies per cell can result in an mtDNA variant co-
existing with a wild-type allele, a condition known as heteroplasmy. The variant's heteroplasmy level can shift
dramatically across generations, as well as spatially/temporally within the same individual. With new data
sources, it is possible for the first time to develop highly accurate models of the processes underlying
mitochondrial genome dynamics. Since these processes have hierarchical aspects, Bayesian hierarchical
modeling is an ideal framework within which to develop such models.
Given this, we propose to pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1) Develop a flexible Bayesian modeling
framework to capture mtDNA dynamics; 2) Apply the framework to large data sets from a variety of clinically-
relevant settings; and 3) Comprehensive model testing, experimental validation, and implementation.
Mitochondrial DNA mutations have been implicated in disease phenotypes including diabetes, autism,
encephalomyopathies, stroke, vision loss, cancer, and many others. As additional relevant data become
available, further elucidation of the impact of mtDNA variation on complex phenotypes is possible. Such insights
are likely to lead to important discoveries in genetics as well as medical applications. This project will facilitate
advances by providing reliable computational infrastructure for efficient and accurate modeling of mtDNA
mutational dynamics. The resulting software will be implemented and disseminated in the free and portable
statistical computing platform R."

 There is a critical need for treatment approaches that conveniently deliver evidence-based interventions of
counseling and pharmacotherapy to a wide range of smokers, and address the complex timeline of cessation
attempt, failure, and re-attempt. The objective of this proposal is to identify the best individualized
pharmacological treatment strategies used for both initial smoking cessation and for rescue therapy among
those who fail to quit or relapse. The trial will use a SMART design (Sequential Multiple Assignment
Randomized Trial) to estimate the comparative effectiveness of (1) an initial 6-week course of either standard
dose varenicline or dual nicotine replacement (our two best performing pharmacotherapies), and (2) among
those smokers who initially fail to quit after the first 6 weeks, to estimate the effects of either continuing on
same medication for another 6 weeks, switching to the medication they did not receive initially, or augmenting
current pharmacotherapy by increasing the dose or adding additional FDA-approved cessation medications. All
treatments will occur via a virtual delivery method ensuring the widest possible application with the fewest
barriers and will include both dynamic pharmacotherapy and counseling delivered in a unified environment to
enhance uptake, effectiveness, and patient experience. The proposed trial will include 2000 adult participants
from throughout Texas who are seeking to quit smoking. Participants will be initially randomly assigned to one
of our two best-performing smoking cessation treatments, either dual nicotine replacement therapy (NRT;
nicotine patch plus lozenge) or varenicline (2 mg/twice daily). After 6 weeks, smoking abstainers will remain on
their current treatment and non-abstainers will be re-randomized to either (a) switch therapies (i.e., receive the
treatment not given in the first 6 weeks), (b) augment their current therapy (change dosage and/or add other
medications, e.g., bupropion), or (c) continue the same medication for 6 more weeks. The treatments will
function as comparators with each other at the selected timepoints specific to each treatment phase. Our
primary outcomes will be biochemically verified (carbon monoxide <6 ppm) continuous smoking abstinence at
Week 6 and at end-of-treatment (EOT) + 30 days. Our secondary outcomes include 6-month abstinence, and
withdrawal, craving, positive and negative affect, and depressive symptoms (anhedonia) Week 6 and at end-
of-treatment (EOT) + 30 days. Our results will inform the patient-provider discussion on the optimal treatment
approach of the future dissemination of our findings. This addresses a critical gap in treating nicotine
dependence because while the majority of smokers relapse within two weeks of an initial cessation attempt
there is little empirical evidence to guide clinicians or patients on the best subsequent treatment to enhance the
likelihood of cessation. Our study sample will be representative of the general population of smokers, drawing
volunteers from diverse community sources as well from disadvantaged populations (Medicaid eligible, rural,
and uninsured)."

How does the brain enable social interactions? The study of social behavior in non-human animals has long
relied on coarse behavioral metrics like time spent interacting with another animal or simply the numbers of
interactions. Although this approach has informed major insights into neural circuits which have a role in
sociability, we still do not know how these circuits orchestrate patterns of social behaviors, especially under
different social contexts where interactions have nuanced differences. Our long-term goal is to identify the
neural mechanisms supporting social behavior in affiliative vs. antagonistic social contexts. To close the
knowledge gap towards this goal, in this R34 we will build artificial intelligence (AI) tools that are capable of
integrating multivariate sources of behavior data to quantify spatiotemporal signatures or “motifs” of diverse
repertoires of social behaviors. Behavioral motifs have the potential to be captured by means of examining
concurrent autonomic rhythms, especially breathing and heart rate. Indeed, we have long known that changes
in the frequency of these rhythms coincide with specific affective and behavioral contexts. However,
spatiotemporal signatures of social behaviors have not been captured in prior studies which have considered
either breathing or heart rate in isolation. Nor have prior studies unleashed the potential to identify novel social
behavioral motifs by using these autonomic rhythms in combination with video measures. The research
objective of this Brain Initiative proposal is to develop semi-supervised artificial intelligence methods that result
in a hierarchical multi-timescale model of social behavioral motifs directly from video, breathing, heart rate, and
movement data via a head-mounted accelerometer. To accomplish this, we will use partial labels of mouse
social behaviors, as well as physiologic measurements, in order to elucidate the full range of social behavior
motifs across affiliative vs. antagonistic contexts. In Aim 1, we will define low-dimensional social behavioral
states while incorporating autonomic rhythms, while in Aim 2, we will elucidate a multi-timescale hierarchical
representation of social behavior in affiliative vs. agonistic social contexts. For both aims, we will integrate
computer vision techniques with high-dimensional video and physiological data from mice while varying their
isolation levels and who they are interacting with. The end-product will be a validated toolkit enabling the
sensitive and robust identification of behavioral motifs. The easy-to-use toolkit which we call the Social Motif
generator (So-Mo) will enable future studies to probe neural circuits during complex mouse behaviors at
unprecedented resolution."

 Achilles tendon ruptures are common musculoskeletal injuries, and the rate of rupture is rising with
increased participation in sports. Vascular irregularities and degenerative changes to extracellular matrix
(ECM) result in poor biomechanical properties that increase risk of tendon rupture. We have discovered that,
following Achilles tendon rupture in mice, the tendon-bone enthesis exhibits profound cell loss, which impairs
remodeling and further increases susceptibility to degeneration. This focal cell loss within the enthesis
motivated our work to study enthesis cell survival during growth and following tendon injury. Our preliminary
studies in mice have established the Achilles enthesis maintains a hypoxic niche during perinatal growth and
depends on Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF1a) for enthesis cell survival. Targeted loss of Hif1a in tendon
and enthesis progenitor cells leads to focal cell death, disruption of enthesis ECM, and failed integration of
tendon into bone. Conversely, overexpression of Hif1a rescues cell within the enthesis following Achilles
tendon injury, suggesting its potential role in guiding tendon and enthesis regeneration. Therefore, we
hypothesize hypoxia is critical for establishing the enthesis progenitor cell/ECM niche, and cell survival in this
niche depends on and is enhanced by Hif1a. Our central goal is to define HIF1-dependent mechanisms of cell
function and ECM production during growth and repair of the fibrocartilage enthesis. We hypothesize that
HIF1a drives enthesis cell differentiation in part by regulating cell survival and ECM deposition. We will use
innovative approaches (e.g., in vivo reporters; subcellular spatial RNA-sequencing; synthetic hydrogels;
nascent protein labeling) to establish the role of HIF1a and hypoxia in maintaining, establishing, and protecting
enthesis progenitors. Our long-term goal is to develop druggable therapeutics to prevent Achilles tendon
rupture and improve tendon and enthesis healing. In Aim 1, we will establish the time course of progenitor cell
survival, differentiation, and ECM deposition in the mouse Achilles enthesis using inducible and tissue-specific
Hif1a-loss and gain of function models. Additionally, we will use synthetic 3D hydrogels to study the effects of
HIF1a and hypoxia on tendon/enthesis progenitor cell survival, nascent ECM deposition, and
mechanotransduction. In Aim 2, we will use parallel approaches to determine if and how HIF1a contributes to
functional healing of Achilles tendon and enthesis using inducible HIF1a LOF and GOF mice with HIF (HIF1a-
GFP and HIF2a-mCherry) reporters and structural/functional testing. We will also use novel HIF-targeting
drugs to determine the therapeutic potential of HIF-agonists in tendon and enthesis healing. Together, we will
identify the emergent role of HIF1a and hypoxia during tendon and enthesis development and repair following
injury. Ultimately, this work will establish the potential therapeutic role of HIF1a in tendon and enthesis repair
following injury, improving clinical care for the prevention and treatment of common musculoskeletal injuries."
10805187,"Candidate - The following application is intended to provide Dr. Kendra L. Clark with the technical and
professional skills necessary to transition into an independent VA research career. Dr. Clark received her PhD
in Genetics and Genomics with a focus on reproductive toxicology in December 2019 and is currently completing
her postdoctoral training focused exclusively on reproductive health research, specifically in regulation of follicle
development, cell signaling, and impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on folliculogenesis. This
award will enable Dr. Clark to expand her research training and further investigate the molecular mechanisms
responsible for environmentally induced reproductive failure in both in vitro and in vivo models, impacts of in
utero exposures on offspring health, and provide the means to prevent environmentally induced reproductive
failure and preserve fertility. Environment - These goals will be accomplished under the primary mentorship of
Dr. John S. Davis, a prominent investigator in the field of ovarian biology and reproductive endocrinology, and
who serves as VA Senior Research Career Scientist. The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) is a
leading academic health and research center that is adjacent to the Omaha VA Medical Center, where strong
scientific relationships have been established to complete the proposed studies. Research - The ovary produces
the female egg, the oocyte, and hormones which are critical for reproduction and quality-of-life. The effect of a
chemical exposure on female reproductive function depends on the developmental/life stage of the exposure as
well as the level and duration of exposure. Ovotoxicants can selectively target a follicle population in the ovary,
resulting in either temporary or permanent infertility, alter ovarian function maternally, and can also impact
offspring through pregestational or in utero exposures. PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that are
resistant to biodegradation and are environmentally persistent. Although virtually 100% of the U.S. population
has measurable exposure to several types of PFAS, little research has been done to understand the effects of
PFAS on reproductive health. The use of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and other PFAS containing
materials at military installations has significantly contributed to the contamination of surface and ground water,
leaving military bases and the communities that surround them at higher risks for PFAS exposure. The most
frequent female reproductive health diagnoses in the VA includes menstrual disorders, endometriosis,
menopausal disorders, and osteoporosis, all of which can be attributed to abnormal functioning of the ovary.
Preliminary data for this proposal demonstrate a role for the Hippo pathway and its effector YAP1 in PFAS-
induced cell proliferation in granulosa cells and follicle growth in cultured neonatal mouse ovaries. In the
research training component of this proposal, Dr. Clark will elucidate the effects of an environmentally relevant
PFAS mixture on human and murine ovarian samples. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that (1) PFAS
adversely impact folliculogenesis through the disruption of pathways that regulate proper and timely follicle
development leading to premature ovarian failure and infertility and (2) PFAS exposure prior to and throughout
pregnancy results in multi/transgenerational effects in offspring that affect reproduction. Specific Aim 1 will
determine PFAS-induced alterations in granulosa cell function in vitro. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether
an environmentally relevant exposure to a PFAS mixture alters follicular dynamics and disrupts Hippo
Signaling in the ovary in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will determine if PFAS-induced alterations in follicular
dynamics leads to premature ovarian failure and infertility in vivo and if pregestational/in utero PFAS
exposure impacts offspring health. The proposed studies are expected to provide a better understanding of
the mechanistic underpinnings in which PFAS exposure may be detrimental for fertility and equip Dr. Clark
with the necessary research and professional skills for her VA research career."
10805885,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affect ~3.7
million Americans and Europeans, and several hundred thousand more worldwide. Genome-wide association
studies have identified more than 200 IBD loci, but distinguishing causal genetic variants from non-causal
variants in linkage disequilibrium, and understanding how non-coding, presumably regulatory variants with the
strongest association signals in most IBD loci confer risk are challenges for functional and clinical translation.
Multiomic data integration and epigenetic fine mapping in IBD-relevant cell types and contexts can bridge
knowledge gaps between statistical genetic associations and a better understanding of underlying pathogenic
mechanisms. A prime example of a non-coding locus with multiple blocks of IBD-associated variants in linkage
disequilibrium is the chromosome 5p13 locus ~250 kb from PTGER4 that is one of the most significant findings
from genetic studies of IBD in both European and African American ancestry groups. PTGER4 encodes EP4,
one of two major PGE2 receptors on T cells. PGE2, together with IL-1β and IL-23, which also have receptors
encoded by IBD risk loci genes, are overexpressed in IBD tissues and modulate Th17 immune cell development
and plasticity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and may cause flares of IBD,
possibly due to disruption of normal immune regulation. The aforementioned rationale motivated us to perform
single-cell trimodal omics assays for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC), gene expression, and cell
surface protein epitope expression in paired T cell samples from healthy young adults that were exposed in ex
vivo experiments to activation stimuli, IL-1β and IL-23, with or without PGE2. Our pilot study shows a significant
enrichment of IBD-associated variants in T cell subtype-specific, especially CD4 memory T cell subtype-specific,
ATAC peaks and significant inhibition of T cell activation by PGE2 in multiple T cell subtypes. We hypothesize
that IBD-associated genetic variants interfere with normal inhibitory effects of PGE2 on T cell activation in specific
CD4 memory T cell subtypes that are also exposed to activation stimuli, IL-1β and IL-23. We propose a trans-
ancestry, single-cell trimodal omics approach to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will perform large-scale, single-
cell trimodal omics experiments in CD4 memory T cells from European and African American/West African
ancestry study subjects and build a first-in-class single-cell trimodal omics atlas of CD4 memory T cells. In Aim
2, we will perform integrative and trans-ancestry analyses of single-cell trimodal omics and genetic data to dissect
IBD-associated loci and to examine similarities and differences of regulatory networks between the two ancestry
groups. We expect to identify the most probable non-coding IBD risk variants and their most probable gene
targets in specific CD4 memory T cell subtypes exposed to activation stimuli, IL-1β, IL-23, and PGE2. Our project
will complement ongoing research by NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium investigators and will also be useful for
the interpretation and prioritization of genetic variants for functional studies in other immune-mediated diseases."

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness characterize by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).
High intraocular pressure (IOP) increases risk for glaucoma, but glaucoma often occurs at low IOP (i.e., normal
tension glaucoma (NTG)). As all current glaucoma therapies target high IOP, there is a critical need for new
therapies for NTG that occurs at already low IOPs.
We have researched the causes and cures for NTG by studying single-gene forms of disease. We discovered that
duplication of the TBK1 gene causes NTG (1 of 3 known single-gene causes). TBK1 encodes a kinase that
phosphorylates an autophagy receptor OPTN (which is encoded by another NTG gene) as a key step in
stimulating autophagy, a ubiquitous catabolic cellular process that degrades defective organelles
(mitochondria) and protein aggregates. We studied fibroblast cells from our NTG patients with TBK1 gene
duplications and engineered transgenic mice with an extra dose of the TBK1 gene and showed that these
mutations cause glaucoma by increasing TBK1 activity in RGCs (increased transcription, protein abundance,
and phosphorylation of OPTN). Moreover, we and others have shown that TBK1 and OPTN mutations that
cause NTG are also associated with dysregulation of autophagy. Mitochondria are strongly implicated as a chief
target of dysregulated autophagy (mitophagy) in glaucoma.
Consequently, we hypothesize that TBK1 gene duplications cause RGC death and glaucoma by dysregulating
autophagy and maintenance of mitochondrial function. We plan to test this hypothesis, by creating and
analyzing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal ganglion cells with TBK1 gene duplications
and their isogenic controls. We propose the following 3-part aim.
AIM 1: Determine the influence of TBK1 gene duplication on RGC health and function using
NTG patient cell culture, stem cell biology, and genome editing.
A. Use CRISPR to correct TBK1 gene duplications in 3 iPSC lines from 3 NTG patients (iPSC lines are in hand).
B. Differentiate iPSC lines into RGCs using our 3D retinal organoid protocol (3 mutant and 3 isogenic controls)
C. Characterize differences in transcription, autophagy, and mitochondrial function between iPSC-derived
RGC lines and isogenic controls using Seahorse, scRNAseq, and autophagy assays.
We have already created iPSC lines from 3 NTG patients with TBK1 duplications and have extensive experience
with genome editing, iPSC biology, RGC differentiation, and autophagy/mitochondrial assays to facilitate
completion of this proposal. We have also published pilot studies of a single iPSC line with TBK1 mutations.
TBK1 is at the center of the pathophysiology of a proportion of NTG cases. We have proposed experiments that
will gain insight into the mechanisms by which TBK1 mutations cause disease and will facilitate future research
to design and test new treatments for NTG patients who already have low IOP."

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
being the major subtype accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Effective treatments for NSCLC are
currently lacking due to the complexity of its molecular subtypes and the incomplete understanding of its
underlying mechanisms.
RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is increasingly recognized as being deregulated in human
cancers, however, specific m6A events in NSCLC are yet to be identified. We found elevated m6A modification
on 7SK small nuclear RNA in NSCLC cells and a NSCLC mouse model. Targeted reduction of m6A-7SK
inhibits NSCLC cell growth in soft agar colony formation assays. 7SK regulates RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)
transcription and is a central player in controlling Pol II transcriptional pausing and elongation. Therefore, m6A
modification of 7SK may underlie NSCLC formation and phenotype.
The goal of this study is to dissect the molecular pathways that regulate m6A-7SK and decipher the
mechanisms by which m6A-7SK affects gene regulatory networks in NSCLC. The first aim is to identify the m6A
sites using real-time PCR-based m6A detection assay, and to identify writer and eraser enzymes of 7SK by
short hairpin RNA knockdown. The second aim is to determine how m6A-7SK influences gene expression and
NSCLC formation. CRISPR dCasRx-ALKBH5 fusion protein will be used to modulate m6A-7SK in NSCLC
cells, and cell proliferation and migration assays will be employed. To determine the molecular details of
m6A-7SK-mediated gene regulation, SHAPE-MaP sequencing will probe the structure of m6A-7SK; nascent
RNA-seq, ChIP-seq of Pol II, and ChIRP-seq of 7SK will be performed to survey transcriptional program in
NSCLC cells with different levels of m6A-7SK.
The results of this study will reveal novel molecular details of m6A modifications on 7SK and how they regulate
cancer gene expression. This information will provide the basis for future research to develop novel NSCLC
therapeutics by altering RNA m6A levels."

Proposed is the development of readily available tools for radiochemistry based on tetrazine ligation— a
bioorthogonal reaction with rapid kinetics that has been studied for over a decade as a uniquely powerful tool for
radiochemical labeling of biomolecules. Limitations in accessing tetrazine and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) labeling
precursors with appropriate kinetic and physicochemical properties have prevented the broader application of
this technology. This proposal builds on several technological innovations in reaction chemistry that have been
developed in the groups of PIs, including a methodology for introducing 18F into aromatic molecules via
photocatalysis via C-H activation or aromatic substitution, a new methodology for the practical and scalable
synthesis of trans-cyclooctenes with favorable kinetic and physiochemical properties, and new methodologies
for the preparation of functionalized tetrazines. Through this collaborative technology proposal, our groups will
leverage these methodologies for the development of new tools for the efficient radiolabeling of proteins in site-
selective fashion and the application of these tools in vitro. In Aim 1, we will develop improved methods for the
synthesis of 18F-labeled trans-cyclooctenes with balanced reactivity, hydrophilicity and stability. Late-stage
photoisomerization will also be used to obtain highly reactive 18F-TCOs, and we will develop methodology for
the site-selective attachment to the C-terminus of cancer-targeting proteins. In Aim 2, a rapid and mild method
for the preparation of 18F-labeled tetrazine reporters will be developed using photoredox radiofluorination
reactions for PET probe construction. In Aim 3, we will validate the newly developed 18F-TCOs and 18F-tetrazines
using the hydrophilic FAPI ligand, the hydrophobic SR142948A, and proteins. The brain permeability of the 18F-
TCO/tetrazine reporters will also be evaluated in normal rats. Because this application focuses solely on the
development of 18F-labeling technologies, the studies in Aim 3 are primarily intended to provide important
feedback to Aims 1-2, which will result in the design of 18F-TCOs and 18F-tetrazines of high utility to the broader
radiolabeling community (in other words, comprehensive evaluation/characterization of specific probes will not
be performed in this application). In summary, we are developing a general labeling toolbox to generate 18F
labeled PET agents. We aim to develop labeling precursors that can be readily commercialized, so that the
developed technologies will be widely used as efficient and simple labeling methods to modify biologically active
small molecules/peptides/proteins/drugs, which could have a significant impact on medical imaging, drug
discovery and development."

The mathematical sciences including engineering, statistics, computer science, physics, econometrics, and
mathematics qua mathematics are increasingly being applied to advance our understanding of the causes,
consequences, and alleviation of obesity. These applications go beyond routine approaches easily implemented
in available commercial software. Rather, they increasingly involve computationally demanding tasks,
development of novel analytic methods and software, new derivations, and an exceptional degree of
interdigitation of two or more existing techniques. Moreover, these methods and applications continue to
advance; the techniques and questions today are not identical to those from five years ago and continuing to
refresh curricula is essential. Advances at the interface of the mathematical sciences and obesity research
require bilateral training for investigators in both disciplines. Yet, our existing proven course is, to our knowledge,
the only ongoing resource to provide such training by scientists. Our successful five day short course features
some of the world’s finest scientists working at this interface to fill the unmet need by providing multiple, topic-
driven modules designed to bridge the disciplines. The demand for and success of the course we offered
annually for the last five years is evidenced by the facts that over 100 people have enrolled in our course, that
over 1300 users have accessed our course video archives, and that over a dozen collaborations have resulted
in successful grant applications or peer-reviewed publications from our course participants and faculty. The first
module serves as a common orientation for investigators approaching the interface predominantly from a
quantitative or obesity lens, followed by 8 modules with topics such as modeling weight change using energy
balance, modeling effects in populations, genomic analysis in obesity, modeling behavioral responses to obesity,
sensor and engineering models, and scaling laws and obesity. Lectures are video-recorded and posted to our
course website for free viewing, thereby extending the reach of our course. Because individuals learn best in
complex tasks when they can interact with the material, we include a number of interactive sessions designed
to engage the participants in active learning. These sessions include panel discussion, debates with audience
participation, question and answer periods, and discovery-based learning activities. These have been refined by
us over the prior funding cycle to be those that best serve and are most highly appreciated by our participants.
Senior faculty offer lectures and lead small group and individual consultations with participants on topics such
as grant acquisition and navigating an interdisciplinary career. The new Mathematical sciences in Obesity
Research Excellence (MORE) Prize will engage participants beyond the course to identify an outstanding
publication on quantitative obesity research to be honored at the following years’ course. The NIH and the
scientific community at large have voiced the need for more training at the interface of the mathematical sciences
and key biomedical domains, and we request the opportunity to continue to be part of the solution."
10793564,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The incidence of proteinuric kidney diseases are increasing with well over 500 million cases worldwide.
Over the last two decades, it has become clear that specialized kidney cells, called podocytes, regulate
kidney filtration and are injured in all forms of proteinuric diseases regardless of etiology. Despite this,
targeted effective therapies that protect podocytes and slow chronic kidney disease progression are
completely lacking. Previously, we reported that the small GTPase Rap1 regulates fundamental
biological processes in podocytes by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms.
We demonstrate that the podocyte Rap1 activation state is controlled by many upstream factors, both
positive and negative, that converge to control the ratio of GTP- and GDP-bound forms. The essential
role of these upstream regulators is emphasized by the presence of human familial nephrotic syndrome
caused by mutations to several of these genes, including newly identified gain of function mutations in
the negative Rap1 regulator, Rap1GAP. Each of these mutations has in common that they cause relative
depletion of podocyte Rap1-GTP. In the current proposal, we show that levels of podocyte Rap1-GTP
are also diminished in human glomerular diseases including in diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
Augmenting levels of podocyte Rap1 activation genetically or pharmacologically protects podocytes in
short term injury models. By targeting podocyte-specific upstream Rap1 regulatory pathways, we are
developing novel Rap1 agonist compounds that activate Rap1 in podocytes, but not in other cell types.
Such an approach allows for podocyte-specific pharmacological Rap1 activation and avoids potential
systemic toxicities. The goals of the current grant are to explore the therapeutic potential of Rap1
agonists in podocyte diseases including in DKD. We accomplish this via three specific aims: i) Test
whether enhanced podocyte Rap1 activation will mitigate chronic glomerular injury utilizing novel
inducible podocyte-specific constitutively active Rap1 transgenic mice. ii) Characterize the glomerular
phenotype of a novel Rap1GAP knock-in mouse model that expresses a double missense Rap1GAP
human disease-associated variant and then utilize both novel mouse models to elucidate specific Rap1
downstream effectors that establish podocyte injury susceptibility versus protection. iii) Synthesize
podocyte-targeted Rap1 agonist compounds and screen their ability to rescue podocyte injury in
transgenic Rap1-GTP deficient zebrafish. The efficacy of lead compounds will be tested in mouse
models of kidney disease including in DKD. Our current lead compound, BT-529, a Rap1-Rap1GAP
interaction antagonist, induces Rap1 activation in podocytes but not in other kidney cells and
dramatically protects cultured podocytes from injury. Overall, this work sets the stage for urgently needed
new podocyte-targeted therapies for kidney diseases."
10793566,"PROJECT SUMMARY
E-cigarettes (EC) are an effective harm reduction strategy in adult combustible cigarette smokers who
exclusively switch to EC, yet African American (AA) have been slower to adopt EC and are underrepresented
in EC research, contributing to an almost complete lack of knowledge about EC as a harm reduction strategy
for a group experiencing the highest risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Relatively little is known
about 4th generation nicotine salt-based pod systems (NSPS), which are the leading class of EC. NSPS EC
contain high nicotine concentrations with rapid nicotine delivery that facilitates exclusive switching. Our pilot
data provide strong preliminary evidence of EC as a harm reduction strategy for AA smokers but there is an
urgent need to conduct a fully powered trial with longer follow-up. Moreover, to enhance EC as a harm
reduction strategy, there is a critical need for interventions to support exclusive switching in dual cig-EC users
who try but initially fail. No such interventions exist. A recent open label study found that varenicline (VAR)
helped dual users eliminate cigarette use but this has strategy not been tested in an RCT. Failure to intervene
with dual users is a missed opportunity among a group who comprises the largest proportion of EC users (>
50%) and is already motivated to reduce their harm from smoking. The objectives of this application are to 1)
compare short- and long-term harm reduction and abuse liability potential (i.e., withdrawal, craving, dependence)
of a NSPS EC in AA exclusive EC, dual cig-EC, and exclusive cig users, 2) characterize factors that predict who
switches fully, partially, or not at all, and 3) examine if harm reduction can be further enhanced by treating dual
users with VAR to eliminate cigarette smoking. Objectives will be accomplished by conducting a 6-week open-
label trial of a NSPS EC and counseling to facilitate a complete switch to EC in AA cigarette smokers (n=500)
who are not interested in quitting all nicotine products but are interested in switching to EC. We enhance harm
reduction potential and capitalize on a missed opportunity by offering dual users additional support to make a
complete switch. At six weeks, those who are dual users (n= ~221) will receive an additional 12 weeks of the
NSPS EC, ongoing counseling to make a complete switch, and be randomized to receive 12 weeks of VAR or
placebo (PBO) to support quitting combustible cigarettes. Follow-up will continue for one-year, providing, to our
knowledge, the first evidence on the long-term harm reduction potential of NSPC EC. The current study is the
first to examine the short- and long-term harm reduction potential of NSPS EC in a priority population and the first
to examine pharmacological support for dual cig-EC users in making a complete switch to EC. Findings have the
potential to support EC as a harm reduction strategy among a disparate group that arguably stands to benefit
from it the most, contribute to the overall goal of reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality, and narrow the
health disparity gap for AA smokers."
10793567,"Adipose tissue B cells are the second most abundant immune cells found in adipose tissue, and they account for more than 20% of the stromal population within adipose tissue during obesity. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have only recently suggested that adipose tissue B cells can modulate adipose tissue function and contribute to the metabolic syndromes suffered during obesity. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adipose tissue B cell function is limited, and this has significantly hampered the potential translational benefit of targeting B cells that dwell in adipose tissue to mitigate obesity induced metabolic disease. The central goal of our project is to define the key regulators for these B cells during obesity. Nevertheless, our new data has opened a novel point of intervention to control the function of these inflammation-promoting B cells through the action of microRNAs that include miR-150. Our data support the central hypothesis suggesting that: Under the stress of obesity, miR-150 is a key regulator of adipose tissue B cell activation where dysregulation of miR-150 facilitates the pro-inflammatory response of adipose tissue B cells and corrupts their ability to interact with other cells in the adipose tissue niche, which results in exacerbated adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. We will critically test this hypothesis in three specific aims by first demonstrating how miR-150 regulates normal B cell function. This will be achieved with the creation of new and unpublished mouse strains that will allow exquisite control of miR-150 action in B cells during different stages of development. Specifically, we will utilize our novel miR-150 B-cell specific knockout and overexpression mice to define how adipose tissue B cells function under lean and obese conditions. In the second aim we will determine the regulatory role of the gene targets of miR-150 in controlling adipose tissue B cell behavior and function. Specifically, miR-150 regulates B cell pathways through specific target genes and we have screened more than 30 predicted genes and successfully identified several B cell specific miR-150 targets. We will utilize ectopic expression and shRNA knockdown to determine their roles in miR-150-mediated ATB activation and subsequent in vivo function in obese adipose tissue. In aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that disruption of miR-150 in adipose tissue B cells interferes with their ability to control cell-to-cell interactions. We will determine the mechanistic regulation of miR-150 during crosstalk with other cell populations including T cells and macrophages derived from adipose tissue and also adipocytes themselves. We have postulated that part of the mechanism used by the pro-inflammatory B cells is through the MHC II pathway, which will be tested under various physiological conditions. Collectively, these three aims will elucidate the critical regulatory mechanism of microRNA-regulated adipose tissue B cells and their contribution in orchestrating the adipose tissue metabolic/immunologic response to obesity."
10790157,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are essential components of signal transduction pathways that mediate cell-
to-cell communication. RTKs are normally under tight regulatory control and have low basal (non-ligand bound)
activity; they are activated transiently in response to specific stimuli. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF1) are closely related polypeptide hormones/growth factors that regulate cell growth and metabolism.
Insulin and IGF1 exert their biological effects on target cells by binding to distinct cell surface receptors, the
insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), respectively, which are structurally related RTKs. Despite
extensive structural and biochemical studies of the separate ectodomains and cytoplasmic domains of these
receptors, a comprehensive understanding of the signal transduction mechanism for IR and IGF1R is still
lacking. To address these issues, we have produced highly purified preparations of full-length IR and IGF1R
that are detergent-soluble, functional, and responsive to their ligands. By complexing the receptors with known
downstream signaling proteins such as tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B and adapter protein IRS1, we will
determine by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy the configurations of the kinase domains and
downstream proteins as well as the specificity factors governing recruitment of these proteins to the activated
receptors. We will carry out functional mutagenesis experiments in mammalian cells to confirm structural
results, and to probe for sites of allosteric regulation. We will test IGF1R mutations recently found to be
associated with type 2 diabetes. Using a computational method (virtual ligand screening), we will identify novel
small molecule IR activators. We will also test the hypothesis that cellular sterol and lipid composition affects
transmembrane signaling by IR and IGF1R. To do this, we will take advantage of new methodology to
manipulate the composition of the plasma membrane in living cells. In our preliminary work, we have used this
approach to demonstrate the importance of membrane sterols on IR and IGF1R signaling. Our work supports
the hypothesis that IR localizes in liquid-ordered (""raft"") domains when active. We will test this hypothesis via
deletion or insertion of hydrophobic residues. We will examine the possibility that statins alter the plasma
membrane environment and lead to decreased IR function. We will also reconstitute IR into lipid vesicles with
and without raft domains, and use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine whether IR
moves to rafts upon insulin stimulation. The work proposed in this grant application will advance our knowledge
of the molecular mechanisms involved in transmembrane signaling by IR and IGF1R. This information should
prove to be valuable in the design of small-molecule agonists or inhibitors to modulate the function of these
RTKs."

Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a matrix cancer center within Vanderbilt University Medical Center
(VUMC). VICC has been part of the cooperative group system for over 27 years, and a Lead Academic
Participating Site since the inception of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Throughout the years, we
have integrated our physicians into leadership roles and our basic science into investigator-initiated trials, as
well as enrolled patients onto clinical trials. Additionally, VICC has a long track record of leadership, both
scientific and administrative, within the cooperative groups/NCTN, and helping junior faculty in clinical trial
development. VICC brings great strengths to the NCTN, including two SPORE grants, an EDRN grant, a world
class Institute of Imaging Science, eight highly funded scientific programs and an Early Therapeutics Clinical
Trial Network (ETCTN) grant where successful early phase trials can be integrated into the NCTN. Our
Personalized Cancer Medicine Initiative (PCMI) is dedicated to matching the appropriate therapy to the genetic
changes, or mutations, that are driving the growth of cancers, with an active research component investigating
mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies. The key informatics of the VICC PCMI is MyCancerGenome,
a website that not only informs physicians on the latest in cancer genomics, but also the availability of trials for
patients whose tumors harbor actionable genetic alterations. With the development of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
and novel immune therapies on the horizon, VICC has recruited top researchers in immunology. Those top
researchers in collaboration with other VUMC investigators created the Vanderbilt Institute for Infection,
Immunology and Inflammation (VI4) with an overall mission to train the next generation scientists and
physicians and make fundamental discoveries in the areas of infection biology, immunology and inflammation
with the goal of increasing knowledge and improving human health. VICC clinicians and scientists are
academic leaders in their respective disciplines and will continue to significantly contribute to the NCTN goals
with the objective to improve the outcomes for cancer patients.
The VICC selected Dr. Jordan Berlin, MD, as Principal Investigator to continue leading the efforts of the
institution to integrate its scientific, academic and patient resources into the NCTN. He has been involved
extensively in the cooperative groups/NCTN in conduct of clinical trials, mentorship and leadership. To assist
Dr. Berlin with the conduct of this grant, VICC created two advisory boards, Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and
NCTN Executive Committee (NEC), whose membership includes a broad representation of medical disciplines
and disease interests across VICC and VUMC. The IAB assures the optimal use of the grant, such as budget
review, assuring multidisciplinary involvement, and participation throughout the NCTN. The NEC implements
operational functions, such as trial opening, accrual and mentoring. Operationally, the NEC has actively
managed NCTN trial opening, accruals and participation across disciplines and groups. Both the IAB and NEC
work to integrate VICC science into the NCTN. The VICC Clinical Trials Shared Resource and its NCTN team
ensures that regulatory, biospecimen, radiology and data submissions are timely and highly accurate.
An extensive plan to further advance the integration of the NCTN into the VICC clinical research enterprise and
VICC research into the NCTN is detailed in the grant, including the new appointment of Dr. Berlin to the role of
Associate Director for Clinical Research Strategy and Shared Resources. This is a new role for VICC,
designed to allow coordination of clinical research priorities across all VICC programs and to increase the
translation of VICC science into clinical trials. For this grant, Dr. Berlin’s new role will help to strengthen the
prioritization of NCTN trials across the institution."
10793501,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental toxicants that are associated with
adverse health outcomes including cancer and thyroid disease. The potential for PFAS exposures to negatively
influence human health has generated significant concerns in scientific, governmental and public realms. PFAS
are used in numerous consumer products, including nonstick cookware, textiles, and food packaging.
Importantly, these chemicals persist in the environment and have long elimination half-lives (~2 to 8 years) in
the human body, leading to near-universal exposure (some PFAS have been detected in the serum of more than
99% of the U.S. population). While limited human studies and evidence from animal models implicate PFAS
exposures in adverse reproductive and pregnancy outcomes including infertility, pregnancy loss, preterm birth,
and low birthweight, knowledge remains scarce, particularly for newer PFAS and PFAS mixtures. Further,
studies that examined perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight measured serum/plasma
concentrations during pregnancy, which may result in confounding by pregnancy-related physiologic changes.
Hence, there is a significant need for studies designed to measure PFAS exposure before conception. To better
define the impact of PFAS exposure on reproductive and pregnancy outcomes, and because environmental
exposures may also affect male reproductive success, we propose an innovative study to measure serum
concentrations of relevant PFAS analytes in both men and women before conception. We will leverage the
Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study (ES009718), a prospective preconception cohort of
couples recruited from a fertility clinic and followed through delivery. The aims of this proposal are to determine
the extent to which maternal and paternal preconception serum PFAS concentrations (individually and as PFAS
mixtures) are associated with: AIM 1) reproductive outcomes of fertilization, implantation, and semen quality
parameters; AIM 2) pregnancy outcomes of pregnancy loss and live birth; and AIM 3) birth outcomes of
birthweight and gestational age. Innovations include the assessment preconception exposure to emerging and
new PFAS and their mixtures in couples and the investigation of early reproductive and pregnancy outcomes
that have not been previously studied. The proposed study is highly time- and cost-efficient, as we will have
archived biospecimens and clinical data available for 834 nulliparous women and 435 men (435 couples). We
will recruit an additional 225 nulliparous women and 180 male partners to increase statistical power to a total of
615 couples. Our team includes expertise in male and female reproductive and environmental epidemiology,
PFAS exposure assessment, and advanced biostatistical and mixtures analysis methods. The proposed study
will have important scientific and public health implications by examining both maternal and paternal PFAS
exposure on reproductive, pregnancy, and birth outcomes, providing much needed data for evidence-based
policy to reduce PFAS exposure and harm."
10793502,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Toxoplasma gondii has the remarkable ability to infect virtually any cell type of almost all warm-blooded
animals and is arguably the most successful parasite on earth, having infected an estimated one-third of
humans globally. While initial infection typically resolves without complication, the parasite is able to persist
for the life of its host, and can re-emerge in the immunocompromised and immunosuppressed to cause fatal
disease. Toxoplasma, like other apicomplexan parasites, must invade a host cell to survive and replicate.
 Once inside a host cell, the parasite survives and replicates within a specialized organelle called the
parasitophorous vacuole. Disruption of the vacuole results in parasite death, and the parasite secretes a
battery of proteins into the vacuole to facilitate its biogenesis and regulate trafficking of nutrients and
effector proteins. A principle structure within the parasitophorous vacuole is the intravacuolar network of
membranous tubules (the IVN), which is thought to act as a major trafficking apparatus. IVN biogenesis is
formed by the direct action of oligomeric complexes of parasite proteins and mutants that disrupt the IVN
show reduced virulence in animal models of infection. We have identified a parasite-specific protein kinase
that regulates the membrane association of a subset of the proteins that associate with the parasitophorous
vacuolar and IVN membranes, and deletion of this kinase results in vacuoles with aberrant IVN tubulation.
While we have identified the kinase substrates and the sites of phosphorylation, the interactions that are
regulated by this phosphorylation are unknown. The goal of the proposed studies is to determine the
precise molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation regulates the inter- and intra-molecular
interactions that drive IVN biogenesis. First, we will determine how the components of the protein
complexes that drive IVN biogenesis change as the complexes progress through the parasite secretory
system and insert into the IVN membrane. We will use molecular genetic, cellular, and biochemical methods
to determine the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation regulates these protein-protein
interactions to facilitate IVN development. Furthermore, we will use innovative biophysical methods to
generate the first structural models of these critical parasite protein complexes to determine the biophysical
mechanism by which they induce IVN formation."

This project represents the comprehensive efforts of the oncology community at Case Western Reserve
University School of Medicine and its three major teaching affiliate hospitals (University Hospitals, Cleveland
Clinic, and MetroHealth) to participate as a Lead Academic Participating Site in the National Clinical Trials
Network (NCTN). The NCTN, funded and directed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is the major consortium
for performing federally-funded, national multicenter clinical trials that aim to improve outcomes for cancer
patients. The emphasis of NCTN trials is late phase (phase III and relatively large Phase II) trials that address
scientific questions that usually cannot be answered by other means such as a single-institution study or an
industry company study. The results of these trials often set the standards of care for cancer treatment in the
U.S. and the world. This includes clinical trials research in rare cancers and underrepresented populations. Our
specific aims for this project are 1) to participate in NCTN trials with exceptionally high levels of accrual volume
and quality of data generation and submission for approximately 240 new patients per year; 2) to serve the NCTN
and the cancer community by providing scientific and administrative leadership in the (Cooperative) Groups that
design and operate these NCTN clinical trials in the entire broad portfolio of cancers; in particular we are full
members with many investigator leaders within NRG Oncology, ECOG-ACRIN and SWOG; and 3) to perform
and present hypothesis-based, investigator-led research that benefits future NCTN research. This includes
secondary clinical and biorepository translational analyses from NCTN data and pilot studies from our institution.
We achieve these aims by assembling an outstanding core of investigators representing all the major cancer
specialties (surgical, radiation, medical and diagnostic oncology) and disease sites (hematologic, lung, breast,
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, brain, gynecologic and melanoma). We have also developed a robust
infrastructure of clinical trials operations in support of the NCTN, including the centralized facilities at Case
Western and the hospital-based clinical trials units. They ensure timely activation of, and education about, NCTN
trials, accrual enhancement, regulatory management and a high quality of research procedures and data
submission. Finally, a major priority is the recruitment, development and mentoring of new Case Western
investigators' involvement within the NCTN, including their participation in the Groups' activities such as their
semi-annual meetings and committee assignments."
10793603,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dental caries represents a common public health problem. Caries involves bacterial invasion, physicochemical
dissolution and proteolysis of the mineral and protein components of teeth. Direct bacterial and byproduct
interaction with dental pulp cells and odontoblasts in dentinal caries activates a protective repair process of
‘tertiary’ dentin formation. This process requires the recruitment and differentiation of dental pulp stem cells
(DPSCs). Clinical therapies such as pulp capping aim to promote dentin regeneration and sustain pulp vitality
and consequently endurance of the natural dentition. However, therapeutic dentin regeneration is elusive. The
cellular and molecular mechanisms orchestrating dentin-pulp regeneration following infection are not fully
elucidated, especially the role of inflammation on dentinogenesis. We have demonstrated that the complement
system, which is an important mediator of inflammation and tissue regeneration, is activated in the caries
process. A major role for complement and C5a binding to its receptor C5aR in responses to injury is well
established. The C5a receptor- like 2 (C5L2) also participated in inflammatory reactions of several pathological
conditions, yet, to date no investigation has explored the role of this enigmatic receptor in tissue regeneration
and stem cell biology. Here, we propose a significant role for the complement system and C5L2 in DPSC
odontoblastic differentiation and reparative dentin formation. Preliminary studies demonstrate that C5L2
expression by DPSCs is quickly increased during odontogenic differentiation, and this expression is potentiated
by the inflammatory cytokine TNFα. Moreover, siRNA silencing of C5L2 expression in DPSCs significantly
increases the expression of dentinogenic markers like DMP1 and DSPP during odontogenic differentiation. We
provide further evidence that p38 map kinase (p38a) plays a key role in DPSC-mediated dentinogenesis. Here,
we explore ways of enhancing this odontoblastic function of DPSCs via a novel C5L2 pathway involving p38a
signaling. We will define the role of C5L2 in the odontoblastic differentiation of DPSC and characterize the
mechanism of action of C5L2 during dentinogenesis. In vivo dentin formation will be evaluated using the mouse
pulp-capping/caries model combined with the C5aR, C5L2 and DSPP/p38a knockout mice. The results obtained
from this project will shed new light onto cellular and molecular events that orchestrate the initial steps of
dentinogenesis by linking the inflammation to DPSC function through C5L2 and p38a pathways. These studies
will provide the basis for future potential therapeutic interventions of dentin-pulp complex regeneration and vital
tooth preservation."

Age-related declines in physical function are predictive of downstream declines such as extended hospital or
nursing home care, declines in cognitive function, an increased risk of disability, and a higher risk for mortality.
It is therefore imperative to understand the possible mechanisms for these declines among older individuals,
with a goal to develop effective prevention strategies and maintaining their quality of life. Dietary quality and
dietary patterns are proven to be critical for overall health and well-being, including age-related declines in
physical function. However, the biological mechanisms for these associations remains an understudied area.
Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in biological specimens, provides researchers an
opportunity to characterize metabolic phenotypes, examine the metabolic changes responsible for disease,
and discover new therapeutic targets. Increasingly, metabolomics is being used to study chronic diseases,
including examining the associations of metabolites with specific phenotypes, characterizing the role of
metabolites as predictors of disease, and studying the causal role of metabolites in interventional studies. It is
important to note that environmental factors such as diet, a modifiable lifestyle behavior, is an important
determinant of metabolite profiles. Chronic disease epidemiology is now focused on identifying the key
circulating metabolites critical to the development or progression of disease that can be modified using
behavioral or other therapeutic interventions. However, significantly less is known about the role of diet-
associated plasma metabolites and their relationship in mediating the associations of dietary predictors and
measures of age-associated declines in physical function. We therefore propose to address this gap in
knowledge, by conducting a study to: (a) determine the associations between measures of dietary quality and
dietary patterns with plasma metabolites, (b) examine the associations between diet-related plasma metabolite
biomarkers with age-related declines in physical function, frailty and disability, and (c) characterize the
mediating effects of diet-related plasma metabolite biomarkers on the associations between dietary predictors
with measures of physical function, frailty, and disability. This study will be conducted in the NIA-supported
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA provides us the opportunity for prospective analyses
and includes dietary data collected using valid methods, assessment of plasma metabolites, measures of
physical function and a wealth of data on potential covariates and confounders to examine our research
questions. Additional replication will be conducted in a second NIA-supported cohort, the Health, Aging and
Body Composition study."
10794203,"ABSTRACT
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic
stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion
strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk
of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for
treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when
identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is
essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage.
Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence
of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this
criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which
overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting
such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most
currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of
signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan
time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse
(or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset
and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for
routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time
windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first
clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis
predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the
presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary
HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative
pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based
ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT
following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected
to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging
to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus
improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT."
10794206,"There are 15 million US cancer survivors, most diagnosed with early-stage disease, so at risk for a
cancer recurrence. There is no population-based information about the risk of cancer recurrence. For decades,
mortality has been the only outcome available to monitor progress in cancer care. As cancer care has
improved, however, the correspondence between recurrence and mortality has diminished. A recent
commentary in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute emphasized that the lack of surveillance data on
recurrence is a barrier to comparative effectiveness research in the realm of cancer care and to research on
cancer quality-of-care. In the clinical setting, the lack of even basic recurrence risk data by cancer type and
stage is a barrier to informed patient-physician decision-making and risk stratification. A high-quality registry of
cancer recurrences would fill these gaps, open new avenues for cancer research, and enable improvements in
clinical care tied directly to the most salient and immediate outcome for all early-stage cancer patients.
 Georgia provides an ideal setting for the first-ever registry of cancer recurrences. The population of
about 10 million is diverse with respect to all major demographic characteristics. The large population ensures
that adequate data on recurrences will accumulate rapidly. The diverse population assures that heterogeneity
of recurrence risk by demographic characteristics will be adequately characterized. The Georgia Cancer
Registry has been a long-term member of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End
Results program, the National Program for Cancer Registries established by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Thus, Georgia has the right
population and the Georgia Cancer Registry has the right infrastructure to accomplish the following two aims:
Aim #1: Use six data streams to signal potential recurrences occuring among Georgia cancer survivors
diagnosed with one of four cancer types (breast, prostate, colorectal, or lymphoma), review medical records to
validate true recurrences, and implement constant learning processes to improve accuracy, efficiency, and
sustainability of the registration process.
Aim #2: For these four cancer types, which represent 43% of incident cases and 58% of prevalent survivors in
the US, generate the first-ever descriptive data on the risks and rates of recurrence over ten years of follow-up
and evaluate how these vary by demographic characteristics.
By achieving these aims, we will fill an important gap in the knowledge base regarding cancer outcomes and
provide a foundation for innovative research on patterns and predictors of recurrence. The recurrence data will
be available to other researchers through existing mechanisms, so resource sharing will be enabled from the
outset. Furthermore, as the infrastructure solidifies and the methods are optimized, the recurrence registration
protocols will be transportable to cancer registries with similar infrastructure and legal authority ."
10794208,"This R35 application proposes a conceptual framework in which a body of work produced by the PI over the past
20 years is utilized as the foundation for launching innovative studies that seek to incorporate cutting edge
understanding of nuclear architecture (how chromatin is organized in three dimensions in the nucleus) to produce
a novel paradigm of lineage determination and cell fate identity. The goal is to better understand how broad
gene expression programs that characterize cell identity are regulated in order to inform regenerative
approaches to cardiovascular disease. Preliminary data suggest that regions of the genome that are localized
to the nuclear periphery (called “lamin associated domains” or LADs) are silenced by specific histone marks,
including H3K9me2, and that these regions are released from the periphery upon lineage determination in order
to allow for simultaneous activation of entire gene programs. Data suggests that the H3K9me2 mark
characteristic of LADs is “remembered” through mitosis providing a mechanism for epigenetic memory of lineage
identity. The proposed model suggests that epigenetic marks such as H3K9me2 that define LADs are
recognized by “LAD-tethers” that mediate spatial localization, and that these histone epitopes can be “shielded”
by phosphorylation of adjacent amino acid residues of the histone tails (including phosphorylation of H3S10 and
H3T11). We propose to test that during mitosis, aurora B kinase which phosphorylates H3S10, acts to un-tether
LADs by shielding the H3K9me2 epitope, allowing for the release of LADs, subsequent breakdown of the nuclear
membrane and DNA replication, followed by removal of S10 phosphorylation and re-establishment of LADs as
the daughter nuclear membranes form around the exposed histone mark. Thus, if the genome-wide pattern of
LADs in a given cell defines its identity by representing a “code” of silenced alternative lineage programs, then
cellular identity can be remembered through mitosis and efficiently re-established in daughter cells. Implications
for reprogramming, trans-differentiation, asymmetric cell division, and stability of lineage identity (and thus
cancer susceptibility) will be explored. Signal transduction cascades that regulate dramatic changes in cellular
metabolism and function (such as the switch between glucose and fatty acid metabolism characteristic of
developing and ailing cardiac myocytes and of cancer cells) may impact nuclear architecture and LAD dynamics
by converging on phosphorylation of histone residues including H3T11. This notion is supported by published
data indicating that a nuclear form of pyruvate kinase that is implicated in metabolic shifts can phosphorylate
H3T11 and can interact with Hdac3 which we have shown is a LAD tether, resulting in epigenetic changes and
activation of specific gene loci. Thus, this proposal provides the opportunity to provide experimental support for
a model of gene regulation and cellular identity that incorporates three dimensional regulation of chromatin
packaging within the nucleus extending our understanding of cellular identity and providing a novel mechanism
to understand the way in which entire gene programs are coordinately regulated."
10794273,"PROJECT ABSTRACT __
Antibiotic exposure in newborns is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including infection with
antibiotic-resistant organisms, asthma, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes among others. Despite this,
antibiotics are misused in neonates at alarming rates and remain the most-prescribed medications in the
nursery. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) can significantly reduce antibiotic exposure but require
specialist support to be effective. Like many evidence-based interventions, a gap remains between research
and widespread implementation. Most well-baby nurseries – particularly those in rural or medically
underserved areas – do not have access to ASP support, which is a major health disparity. Scalable
approaches to increase implementation of evidence-based practices, such as ASPs, are needed to address
such disparities. Telehealth has been used successfully to deliver other aspects of newborn care, such as
complex care coordination and health screening. Telehealth strategies have been used in adult and pediatric
ASP efforts, and telehealth for infectious diseases support has been endorsed by the Infectious Diseases
Society of America. Our preliminary study, ASSIST-1, was the first to utilize telehealth to deliver ASP support
specifically for newborn nurseries. The ASSIST-1 study of 8 rural nurseries showed that telehealth ASP was
safe and effective, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use by 32%. In this R18 health services research
demonstration and dissemination grant, we aim to use dissemination and implementation (D&I) science to
accelerate delivery of our evidence-based telehealth ASP to additional level 1 and 2 nurseries (N=40) in rural
or medically underserved areas throughout Texas. Our hypothesis is that nursery telehealth is a scalable
approach to increase access to infectious diseases care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure among
newborns born in medically underserved areas. We will test our hypothesis using an effectiveness-
implementation hybrid type 2 design based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,
Maintenance (RE-AIM) and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) models to measure
uptake, efficacy, and sustainability of the telehealth ASP. Our specific aims are to evaluate (1) the adoption, (2)
the effectiveness, cost, and value, and (3) the maintenance and sustainability of the telehealth ASP. The study
team includes content experts in neonatal infectious diseases (Drs. Cantey and Duchon), D&I science (Drs.
Stevens and Kilpela), and patient-centered outcomes and cost-effectiveness research (Dr. Tsevat). The
proposed research is innovative in its use of telehealth strategies to link rural hospitals with pediatric infectious
diseases specialists, improve care for infants with suspected or proven infection, and minimize adverse effects
of unnecessary antibiotic exposure. In addition, successful implementation of our study could subsequently
serve as the platform for linking rural nurseries to other pediatric subspecialists, thus relieving access-to-care
disparities and improving the quality, equity, and value of care for infants born in medically underserved areas."

Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites that can negatively impact host viability and fertility. They
have been identified as the causes of inherited human disorders and cancers. Despite their detrimental effects,
TEs are prevalent across eukaryotic genomes and exhibit dramatic variation in abundance and genomic
positions within and between species. For instance, the proportion of vertebrate genomes occupied by TEs
ranges from only 6% in pufferfish to 65% in salamander. Over 45% of the human genome harbors TEs, and
any two people differ by at least a thousand TE insertions. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary
forces drive TE variation and how that influences functions and, thereby, host health. Most studies of the
harmful effects of TEs have centered on TE-mediated physical disruption of DNA and changes in DNA
sequences. While such genetic disturbances have important consequences, this paradigm overlooks the
detrimental epigenetic effects mediated by TEs, including biochemical modifications of chromatin and
reorganization of three-dimensional (3D) genome structures. My recent pioneering studies revealed, on a
genome-wide scale, that epigenetically silenced TEs can perturb the function of neighboring genes through cis
spreading of silencing marks (cis epigenetic effects of TEs) and alter 3D genome organization (3D epigenetic
effects of TEs). These exciting observations offer a possibility to answer long-unresolved questions about why
there are between-species differences in TE content and how these differences affect genome function and
evolution—the overarching goals of my research program. My laboratory uses Drosophila as a primary model
and integrates evolutionary genomics and cell biology to decipher the functional and evolutionary significance
of TE variation. One major goal of my research program is to determine how TE variation influences genome
evolution through my newly discovered 3D epigenetic effects of TEs. My research group will use integrative
genomic analysis at multiple levels (DNA, RNA, epigenetics, and 3D genome structures) to investigate our
hypothesis that the 3D epigenetic effects mediated by TEs can produce varying 3D genome organization. We
further predict that this TE-mediated variation in 3D genome structures can shape genome evolution by
affecting fundamental genetic processes. In addition, my laboratory seeks to identify the molecular and
evolutionary mechanisms contributing to between-species differences in TE content. We will use Drosophila
genetics and transgenics to identify host genetic factors that modulate the epigenetic effects of TEs in cis and
in 3D nuclear space. Furthermore, we will combine comparative evolutionary genomics and experimental
evolution to investigate our hypothesis that between-species variation in these host genetic factors contributes
to varying epigenetic effects of TEs and ultimately drives the evolution of divergent TE content across
Drosophila species. Our discoveries will provide a novel basis for understanding eukaryotic genome evolution
and open new perspectives for TEs' roles in human health and disease."

 Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the interneurons that transmit visual information from the eye to the
brain. Degeneration or death of RGCs results in a number of blinding conditions, including glaucoma. RGCs can
be classified into many subtypes, each with distinct morphologies, functions, and gene expression profiles. While
RGC subtypes have been identified in many vertebrate model organisms, RGC subtypes in the human retina
have not been well-characterized molecularly. Moreover, the mechanisms controlling the specification of RGC
subtypes remain poorly understood, especially in the human retina. In this project, I will study human retinas and
organoids to identify human RGC subtypes and determine mechanisms controlling their generation. My work will
yield mechanistic insights into human RGC subtype specification and facilitate the use of stem cell-derived
organoids in regenerative therapies for retinopathies like glaucoma.
 One of the major goals of this project is to molecularly classify the RGC subtypes of the adult human
retina. Based on published single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in human and macaque retinas, I
generated a testable gene expression code to uniquely identify each RGC subtype. I will use this gene
expression code to guide combinatorial expression analysis (i.e. immunohistochemistry and RNA FISH) and
identify human RGC subtypes. I have already distinguished three human RGC subtypes using my gene
expression code. I will also characterize the morphologies of these RGC subtypes. I will use combinatorial IHC
and the lipophilic dye DiD to molecularly and morphologically classify human RGC subtypes (Aim 1).
 A major challenge to studying human RGC biology is the limited access to genetically and
pharmacologically manipulatable human tissue. Human retinal organoids provide a powerful model to study
developing human tissue in controlled conditions. The Johnston lab advanced the use of human retinal organoids
to study the mechanisms controlling photoreceptor fate specification. I showed that organoids are a tractable
model system to study RGC biology by developing an RGC axon outgrowth assay, which demonstrated that
RGCs rapidly extend axons, recapitulating their in vivo capabilities. Furthermore, I identified two subtypes of
RGCs in organoids. To identify the repertoire of RGC subtypes in human organoids, I will assess expression
based on the testable gene expression code and complement this approach by conducting scRNA-seq over a
time course of organoid development (Aim 2). The transcription factors EOMES/TBR2, TBR1, and TBX5 have
been implicated in RGC subtype specification. To investigate mechanisms that specify human RGC subtypes, I
will utilize CRISPR mutagenesis to knock out and viral transfection to ectopically express these three
transcription factors and examine changes in RGC subtype populations in human retinal organoids (Aim 3)."

During female meiosis, ¾ of the chromosomes are eliminated and only ¼ of the
chromosomes are inherited by a single egg. In contrast, all chromosomes are
distributed among 4 sperm during male meiosis. The elimination of ¾ of the genome to
allow inheritance of only ¼ of the chromosomes is conserved in all animal phyla,
suggesting some fundamental selective advantage. The long-term goals of this project
are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of chromosome elimination and elucidate the
selective advantages of asymmetric meiotic division. Errors in meiosis lead to the
absence of one chromosome (monosomy) or the presence of an extra chromosome
(trisomy) in 10-30% of human conceptions with the majority of these aneuploidies
leading to embryonic death. By elucidating the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome
elimination in C. elegans, we will identify mechanisms likely to be defective during
human meiosis. Fertilization occurs during female meiosis in nearly all animal species.
Therefore, animals must have mechanisms to prevent incorporation of paternal
chromosomes into the meiotic spindle which could eliminate paternal chromosomes in a
polar body causing lethal monosomy. We have demonstrated that, in C. elegans,
microtubule driven transport moves the meiotic spindle to a cortical position away from
the future site of fertilization, and that the sperm contents are immobilized at the distant
site of fertilization by cortical actin. Cortical positioning of the meiotic spindle and sperm
contents at opposite ends of the zygote resists cytoplasmic streaming which circulates
membranous organelles around the zygote. Actin depolymerization results in
movement of a cohesive unit containing sperm-derived DNA, centrioles, mitochondria
and other membranous organelles with cytoplasmic streaming. However, the resulting
collisions between the sperm contents and meiotic spindle do not result in incorporation
of paternal chromosomes into the meiotic spindle. We seek to elucidate the completely
unexplored mechanism that holds the sperm contents together as a cohesive unit, as
this is both required to allow tethering to cortical actin far from the spindle and, as a
backup mechanism, insulates paternal chromosomes from capture into the meiotic
spindle. We have uncovered a second selective advantage of asymmetric meiosis by
demonstrating that extra chromosomes present in trisomic or triploid C. elegans are
preferentially deposited in a polar body. We seek to determine the mechanisms that
preferentially move extra chromosomes toward the polar body. These mechanisms
allow triploid or aneuploid C. elegans to have a high frequency of offspring with a normal
chromosome number and could be relevant to the health prospects for offspring of
women with triploX syndrome, trisomy 21 or mosaic trisomy. In addition, we will
continue to elucidate the katanin, kinesin and dynein-dependent mechanisms ensuring
bipolar meiotic spindle assembly and positioning. We will accomplish these goals by
directly monitoring the movements of chromosomes and organelles by time-lapse
imaging of zygotes observed in utero within transparent C. elegans after perturbations
by RNA interference, auxin-induced degrons and optogenetic manipulations."

Sustained attention represents a fundamental dimension of cognitive control and refers to the process of allocating
cognitive resources to appropriately respond to infrequent but task-relevant stimuli. Sustained attention differs from
the more commonly studied shifting or dividing attention since it lacks the defining features of capacity limitation and
competition. Deficits in sustained attention are common in psychiatric illnesses including attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Understanding the network substrate of sustained attention will thus
significantly advance our ability to develop circuit-based therapeutics that selectively engage and restore the activity
patterns that drive sustained attention. Synchronization in two higher-order networks have emerged as neural sub-
strate of sustained attention and cognitive control in general. First, the frontoparietal network acts as a generator of
top-down control signals. Second, the posterior thalamo-cortical network gates processing of input and exhibits task-
modulation during sustained attention. Yet, it remains unclear if the synchronization through oscillations in these two
networks plays a causal in sustained attention and more broadly in cognitive control. Targeted brain stimulation of
individual network nodes with rhythmically patterned stimulation offers the opportunity to manipulate specific network
oscillatory patterns and examine the resulting change in behavioral performance to establish a causal role of the
targeted activity pattern. Such causal neuroscience of higher-order brain function will fundamentally advance our
understanding of how cognition arises from large-scale electrical activity patterns in the brain. The overall objective is
to identify the causal role of oscillatory functional interactions in sustained attention by rhythmic optogenetic stimula-
tion. We will employ a widely used paradigm of sustained attention in animals, the five-choice serial reaction time
task (5-CSRTT), in combination with rhythmic optogenetic stimulation and multisite electrophysiology in ferrets. We
use the ferret (instead of more commonly used rodent species) for the study of the oscillatory substrate of cognitive
function since we previously found that the ferret shares two fundamental top-down brain rhythms with humans:
frontal theta oscillations that provide control of posterior parietal cortex and posterior alpha oscillations that gate
visual perception. The proposed project builds on our published work of oscillatory interactions in these two networks
as a function of engagement with both the 5-CSRTT and sensory input in ferrets, and our preliminary data of suc-
cessful modulation of neuronal spiking, functional connectivity, and behavioral performance in the 5-CSRTT by fre-
quency-specific rhythmic optogenetic stimulation. We hypothesize that oscillatory functional interaction in these two
networks is dynamically regulated to drive sustained attention in this task. Completion of these three aims will pro-
vide an in-depth understanding of the causal role of frontoparietal and posterior thalamo-cortical network in sustained
attention. The rationale of this project is that advancing the causal investigation of synchronization in higher-order
brain structures in cognitive control will open new avenues for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies for deficits in cognitive control. The proposed work is thus of high translational significance and broad
impact since sustained attention is impaired in numerous psychiatric illnesses."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal disease of the pulmonary arteries with few supportive
therapies and no cure. In PH, occlusive `neointimal lesions' grow within small pulmonary
arteries and narrow vessel lumens, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately
resulting in right heart failure and death. Available PH therapies are vasodilators that do not
target neointimal growth and neither prevent progression nor reverse disease. Understanding
the biology of neointimal lesion growth – which cells are responsible for lesion expansion, and
the pathways that control their proliferation – is key to the development of more effective
therapies for pulmonary hypertension. In preliminary studies we find that proliferating neointima
cells are adjacent to artery endothelial cells and have distinct gene expression that distinguishes
them from cells located away from the endothelium. We hypothesize that a molecularly defined
subset of neointimal cells located adjacent to the endothelium is the proliferating fraction that
expands neointimal lesions, and that signals from the endothelium regulate lesion growth.
Specific Aims: (1) Using proliferation tracking, genetic lineage tracing and ablation, identify and
molecularly characterize the subset of neointimal cells whose proliferation is responsible for
lesion growth. (2) Through bioinformatic analysis of single cell transcription in neointima and
artery endothelial cells from mouse and human, identify candidate signals driving neointimal
proliferation in PH and the core disease mechanisms shared between mouse and human. (3)
Test the ability of a key candidate driver of neointimal proliferation for a role in lesion growth in
multiple PH models. Here, by utilizing cutting edge technologies, genetics, and single cell
approaches across multiple model systems, these experiments will provide a granular
understanding of the cells and signals driving neointimal lesion expansion, adding substantially
to the current knowledge surrounding the pathology of vascular remodeling in PH, findings we
hope will ultimately lead to neointima-blocking treatment options."
10793968,"PROJECT SUMMARY. To find an object in a complex scene, we use feature-based attention to guide our
search, typically in conjunction with spatial attention and targeting eye movements. When searching for our keys
on a table, for example, the features of the keys are used as an attentional template that guides the eyes to the
various objects sharing features with keys until the keys are found. Work from our own and other labs has found
that objects with attended features or attended locations are processed more efficiently in visual cortex, while
the processing of unattended, distracting objects is suppressed. To design an effective neural prosthesis or to
treat people with sensory or attentional impairments, we need a better mechanistic understanding of these
attentional mechanisms at the systems level. The interconnected structures important for the control of attention
have many common features. At the surface level, these common features suggest there may be little difference
in their functions. However, our results show surprising specificity instead. We find that the ventral pre-arcuate
area (VPA) and the frontal eye fields (FEF) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) have different functions in visual search.
Specifically, VPA appears to mediate the selection of likely targets based on their features, and FEF directs
spatial attention and gaze to those possible targets until the object of the search, the target, is found. We
hypothesize that VPA and FEF work together as an interconnected system for guiding gaze to objects we are
searching for, and that they also provide attentional feedback to the occipital and temporal cortex, including the
mid-superior temporal sulcus (mid-STS) region. This feedback biases visual processing in favor of attended
target features. In Aim 1, we will test whether feedback from FEF to visual cortex and VPA is specific for attended
locations, as we propose, or whether the feedback conveys priority values computed from both attended features
and locations. In Aim 2, we will use electrical stimulation coupled with functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to finely map the connectome of the mid-STS region, which receives projections from VPA and has been
recently proposed as an important component of the system for the top-down control of attention. The published
connectome will provide a test of anatomical mapping principles that we recently discovered in PFC, and it will
be a valuable resource for the neuroscience community. In Aim 3, we will use neurophysiological recordings in
VPA, FEF, the mid-STS, and other structures proposed to be important for attention, coupled with causal
methods such as optogenetics and muscimol injections to test our hypotheses about the roles of the different
components. One of the key innovations of this project is that we will map the connectivity of the recorded sites
with electrical stimulation and fMRI so that we can target our recordings to the specific neuronal groups in
different structures that are interconnected with one another. In total, we expect these studies to give us the best
account so far of how the interactions among multiple brain structures leads to effective visual processing during
attention to object features."
10794934,"The long-term goals of the proposed research are both to elucidate central molecular controls over development and
diversity of neocortical callosal projection neuron (CPN) connectivity, and to identify potential causes and therapeutic
approaches to disease involving CPN circuitry. CPN are the broad population of inter-hemispheric pyramidal neurons
whose axons connect the two cerebral hemispheres via the corpus callosum. CPN play key roles in high-level associative, integrative, cognitive, behavioral, sensory, and motor functions, based on precise, area-specific CPN subtype connectivity and diversity. Disruptions in CPN development are correlated with deficits in multiple disorders, including agenesis of the corpus callosum, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia. Currently, how the remarkable diversity of CPN subtypes and connectivity is specified, and how transcriptional programs implement specific connectivity via local, cell-autonomous effectors, is unknown. Our lab recently identified a combinatorially-expressed set of genes that both define CPN as a broad population, and identify novel subpopulations of CPN during development (Neuron, 2005, 2016a,b; J Neurosci, 2009; Cer Cor, 2016a,b). We also developed innovative approaches to investigate subtype-specific, subcellular growth cone (GC) molecular machinery. Building on this work, we propose deep and rigorous functional investigation of Cited2 control over precise CPN connectivity & circuit wiring, including RNAs & proteins detected uniquely in GCs. Cited2 is an exemplar transcriptional co-regulator that we hypothesize functions importantly in development of precise areally- and functionally-specific CPN circuitry in somatosensory cortex, and its dysfunction elucidates disorders of CPN connectivity and diversity.
 We have already identified that Cited2 regulates and refines two stages of precise CPN development and diversity,
functioning 1) broadly in basal progenitors to regulate generation of superficial layer CPN, and 2) postmitotically in an area-restricted manner to refine distinct, precise identity and development of somatosensory (S1) CPN. To connect Cited2 transcriptional regulation to local implementation of S1 CPN connectivity in developing GCs, we propose to: Aim 1) investigate CPN-autonomy of Cited2 regulatory function in S1 CPN postmitotic development and connectivity, via novel mosaic, recombinase-based genetic manipulation technology (“BEAM”) for dual population analysis; Aim 2) investigate GC & soma RNA & proteomes of WT vs Cited2 cKO S1 CPN during axon development via new and innovative approaches, to gain direct mechanistic understanding of CPN circuit development at critical developmental stages; Aim 3) investigate the specific function of GC-localized downstream effectors that are dysregulated in Cited2-null CPN; and Aim 4) investigate the integrated function of precise CPN circuit development in cognitive & ASD-relevant behavior. Together, the proposed studies will provide substantial insight from gene to circuit to behavior into molecular control over development, diversity, and precision of connectivity of CPN subtypes with distinct function and integration of cortical information, processes centrally disrupted in human disorders. Controls over CPN connectivity are now essentially unknown, and transcriptional dysregulation has not been previously connected to downstream local effectors of circuit development. This research will contribute to understanding cortical organization, function, and potentially toward prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of human disorders."

persons with AD/ADRD, family caregivers, and volunteers across 19 Regional Program Coordinator regions to
one of two groups: one that receives the Porchlight Project over a 12-month period and a usual care control
condition that receives standard volunteer support. An embedded experimental mixed methods design will be
utilized that will incorporate various qualitative data collection elements within the 12-month randomized
controlled evaluation of the Porchlight Project (Stage III of the NIH Stage Model). Twelve month outcomes that
we hypothesize the Porchlight Project will influence include: 1) increased volunteer competence; 2) increases
in quality of life and reduced loneliness for the person with AD/ADRD; and 3) increased self-efficacy,
decreased stress, and improved well-being for caregivers. The Porchlight Project offers a potentially efficient,
wide-ranging service model for states and communities to implement that can facilitate the “dementia
capability” of their various volunteer programs. Moreover, creating effective linkages to community-based
long-term services and supports addresses several goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease
as well as the recent Dementia Care Services and Support summits."
10795012,"Rates of cannabis use (CU) among pregnant women are increasing dramatically. A sizable proportion of
women who use cannabis prenatally exhibit clinical levels of distress (e.g., depression and anxiety), conditions
that already raise risk for poor outcomes. Indeed, some women may use cannabis because it is perceived as
less risky, or more acceptable, than psychopharmacological treatments for depression and anxiety.
Pregnancy-related physical symptoms (e.g., nausea) are also identified motives for CU. However, adverse
outcomes to both mother and child associated with perinatal CU have been documented. Despite medical
recommendations to avoid cannabis use during pregnancy, there are currently no empirically-tested effective
interventions to aid pregnant women in doing so. Our team’s pilot data, as well as others’ findings, show that
many women who continue CU prenatally have conflicted feelings about their use, and experience challenges
with the process of quitting. Among women who are able to quit CU when they become pregnant, relapse is
not uncommon, especially after delivery. Interventions that address the needs of cannabis-using perinatal
women - elevated distress (depression, anxiety) and physical symptoms (nausea, pain) are critically needed.
Physical activity (PA) interventions may play a key role as an alternate coping strategy for distressed pregnant
women – thus decreasing CU. Our team has a strong history of developing PA interventions for pregnant
women and individuals with addictive behaviors. We were the first group to develop and test a lifestyle physical
activity (LPA) approach with depressed pregnant women, and for women with depression in alcohol treatment.
LPA interventions represent simple low-cost approaches that are supported by brief counseling and activity
monitors (e.g., Fitbit) to facilitate goal-setting and monitoring. Because LPA involves short bouts of activity
integrated into the structure of daily life, pregnant women can engage in PA in-the-moment to cope with
negative affect or cravings as an alternate to CU. In light of its potential as an efficacious, acceptable, and
disseminable intervention to reduce perinatal CU, we propose to develop an LPA intervention for women at
high risk for prenatal CU, and obtain data on the intervention’s feasibility and acceptability. This R34 will have
an intervention development phase, which will include a small open pilot trial (N=20), followed by a pilot
RCT phase, during which we will conduct a pilot randomized trial (N=50) comparing the LPA+Fitbit condition to
a Fitbit Only condition, with assessments of CU, PA, and other outcomes at multiple points extending to 4
weeks postpartum. At the study’s conclusion, we will have developed and pilot-tested a novel, technology-
supported PA intervention for pregnant women at high risk for prenatal CU. If deemed acceptable and feasible,
the efficacy of this intervention can be evaluated in a subsequent fully-powered trial. Ultimately, this research
will facilitate development of an alternate coping strategy for women to manage their distress and symptoms
during pregnancy, thus decreasing prenatal CU and lowering risk for adverse maternal and infant outcomes."

Humans, like other animals, regularly modify behavior based on environmental context. This relies on the
ability to discriminate between environments and develop strategies for maximizing rewards (or minimizing
punishment) in a context-specific manner. A breakdown in this ability to change behavior depending on
environment is prominent in dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Our central objective is to identify the specific
neuronal circuits and activity dynamics required for acquiring goal-oriented behaviors in novel environments.
We focus on the hippocampus, a region critical for discriminating between environments and necessary for
encoding certain types of behavior. Our central hypothesis is that cell-type specific inhibitory circuits regulate
the pyramidal network dynamics that encode goal-oriented behavior. Specifically, we use in vivo two-photon
calcium imaging to visualize the activity of genetically-defined subsets of hippocampal CA1 neurons as mice
complete goal-oriented tasks in virtual reality (VR) environments, using water rewards for motivation (Arriaga
and Han, J. Neurosci., 2017). With this system, we recently found that both parvalbumin (PV)- and
somatostatin (SOM)-expressing inhibitory interneurons are strongly suppressed in novel environments, with
gradual recovery of activity over days as task performance increases (Arriaga and Han, eLife, 2019). In Aim 1,
we will use a combination of imaging, behavior, and correlative functional and immunolabeling microscopy to
define putative disinhibitory VIP+ neurons activated in novel environments. In Aim 2, we will define the kinetics
of excitatory network reorganization in novel environments during goal-oriented behavior. If inhibitory activity
plays a major role in controlling the encoding of information in excitatory networks, we should see similar
kinetics in activity dynamics across the two networks, i.e. slow stabilization over days. We will track individual
pyramidal neurons during task-engaged behavior in novel environments to define activity dynamics of the
excitatory network. To facilitate this goal, we have developed a neural network-based decoder that tracks the
contribution of individual neurons to population position coding across days. In Aim 3, we will determine the
necessity of inhibition suppression and disinhibition activation for goal-oriented behavior and pyramidal
network reconfiguration. We will test this by chemogenetically restoring inhibitory SOM+ and PV+ interneuron
activity (separately), or silencing PV+ neurons, in novel environments and compare task performance with
control mice. To illuminate possible circuit mechanisms downstream of inhibitory activity manipulation, we will
image excitatory neuron activity to evaluate alterations in network reorganization as defined in Aim 2. This
contribution is significant because it promises to link cell type-specific inhibitory activity with novelty-induced,
pyramidal network reorganization and goal-oriented behavior in vivo. These studies may lead to new circuit-
targeted approaches to enhance network function for the treatment of behavioral impairment associated with
many cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases."

Despite decades of attempts to “close the gap” between spoken language skills of children who are deaf and
hard of hearing (DHH) and their hearing peers, this goal remains elusive. Reduced audibility and delays in
identification and amplification hamper spoken language development of children who are DHH. To “catch up,”
their language learning rate must outpace that of typical development. However, they often exhibit slower, not
faster, language acquisition rates and require more exposures to learn words than their hearing peers. Thus,
children who are DHH need effective and efficient interventions to achieve the trajectory required to reach age
expected language skills and improve their long-term educational and vocational outcomes.
Retrieval practice, which is prominent in cognitive psychology but less dependably applied to education and
even less so to special education, is an empirically validated approach that could improve the language
learning of children who are DHH. Retrieval practice is hypothesized to improve learning by enhancing the
value of word presentations and countering the need for extra word exposures relative to hearing peers. To
advance the promising yet underutilized research on retrieval practice, we complete the next logical step of
evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of two key retrieval practice features: feedback (Aim 1) and spacing
(Aim 2). Feedback is predicted to result in more efficient learning because it focuses attention on unmastered
material, prevents the illusion of success, and reduces repeated errors. Spacing trials are predicted to result in
more efficient learning than massed trials because they require more effort with fewer cues provided. Study
innovations include the critical evaluation of retention and use of a multi-session intervention context.
We will accomplish these aims through four single case adapted alternating treatments design studies with
sixteen 5-8 year old children who are DHH. Four children complete each contrast of conditions to isolate the
effects of feedback and spacing. Results via visual analysis and effect sizes will reveal the degree to which
retrieval practice is expected to support word learning for children who are DHH and whether learning is
enhanced by the inclusion of feedback and spaced teaching trials. This knowledge could have broad
implications for maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of word learning interventions in the short-term and
more comprehensive language interventions in the long-term for children who are DHH. Next steps will
address (a) evaluating the effects and possible mechanisms of retrieval practice that combines the most
effective intervention features and (b) identifying child characteristics that mediate and moderate intervention
effects in a randomized control trial. Future studies will expand retrieval practice to other language areas and
the modality of sign language. This work would advance the field, which exhibits a dearth of rigorous
intervention research, despite the important, long-standing challenge of improving language skills and
subsequent educational and vocational outcomes of children who are DHH."
10795020,"Malignant gliomas (MG) are the most aggressive malignancy of the central nervous system with the mean
survival time of 15 months. Fast progression and high heterogeneity of MG mandates frequent imaging (MRI)
to measure therapeutic responses. Imaging alone, however, is limited by false positives (“pseudoprogression”)
and lacks molecular specificity. Tissue analyses could augment imaging results, but carries the risk of
comorbidity and sampling errors. The goal of this project is to address such challenges and advance a
minimally invasive, hence serially repeatable clinical assay specific to MG. We will exploit extracellular
vesicles (EVs) as a new class of circulating cancer biomarker. Increasing number of studies evidence EVs'
potential utility: these vesicles, are released from all cells, function as reliable cellular surrogates and reflect
global tumor burden, overcoming limitations of tumor heterogeneity and sampling bias. We now seek to
establish a translational EV assay for MG diagnosis and treatment monitoring, and compare its performance
with gold standard imaging-based diagnostics. First, we will standardize EV assay protocols for clinical
workflow. We will adopt our validated technologies: ExoLution, a clinical grade kit for EV isolation; Shahky, a
high-throughput plasmonic instrument for EV protein analyses; and digital droplet PCR for highly sensitive EV
mRNA detection. Leveraging the developmental and regulatory expertise of Exosome Diagnostics, we will
make these platforms ready for translation into clinical diagnostic laboratories. Second, we will perform a
targeted clinical study, critically assessing EVs' diagnostic and prognostic capacity for GBM. We will collect
circulating EVs from GBM patients undergoing therapies and monitor serial changes of EV protein/mRNA
profiles, particularly to detect the early sign of acquired resistance. We will compare results from EV assays
and accompanying MRI, and build an integrative model for treatment monitoring. We formed a powerful
multidisciplinary team to conduct these projects: Brain Tumor Center at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) which operates a vast biobank program of human clinical samples; Center for Systems Biology at
MGH, a pioneer in developing new technologies for EV analyses; and Exosome Diagnostics, a de-facto
industry leader in EV-based liquid biopsy with extensive experience in assay standardization. Collectively, the
team has a track record of studying EVs' potential as a gliomas biomarker and has established optimal EV
assays for molecular analyses. We will ensure assay reliability and reproducibility to deliver clinically
translatable EV tests. We will also impose stringent quality controls on assay design and sample processing,
accrue well-annotated patient and control samples, and perform statistically powered clinical studies. The
technical and scientific outcomes of this research could have a significant translational impact in gliomas
care by establishing a robust and highly specific clinical tool for gliomas diagnostics and treatment monitoring."

Digital phenotyping, the in-situ quantification of individual-level phenotypes using data from digital devices, is a
promising new tool for measuring patterns of emotion and mood in the context of individuals lived experience.
Our work using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), an interactive form of digital phenotyping, shows
that patterns in emotional valence and arousal associate with and predict mood symptom severity. Specifically,
mean levels, greater day-to-day fluctuations (instability), and large increases or decreases (anomalies) in
emotion are associated with heightened risk. However, EMA is burdensome if administered frequently,
highlighting the need for complimentary passive digital phenotyping methods that unobtrusively measure
emotion patterns. Our team has developed an app and a series of machine learning algorithms, PRIORI, that
samples the ambient audio every 15 minutes and produces computational estimates of emotional valence and
arousal that correlate with EMA measures. The goal of the present study is to investigate how to mitigate the
burdensome participation requirements of EMA, and substantially improve the ability to predict mood
symptoms using passive (PRIORI) technology. Individuals (n=160) with an established pattern of mood
instability from a prospectively studied cohort of bipolar individuals will enroll into a six-month digital
phenotyping protocol including continuous passive monitoring using PRIORI. In a measurement-burst protocol
one week per month, participants will complete EMA self-reported mood (2xday), self-reported emotion
valence and activation (5xday), and a clinician interview to assess manic and depressive symptoms. Outside of
these bursts, participants will complete weekly EMA ratings of mood. Our central hypothesis is that patterns of
emotional valence and arousal assessed via digital phenotyping will predict mood severity in BD. We will test
whether the prediction of mood severity using EMA data will be enhanced by including measures derived from
PRIORI. Given that EMA data may not always be present (while PRIORI data are), we will also test whether
including emotion estimates from PRIORI during weeks when EMA is not present improves later mood
prediction. Our specific aims test independent hypotheses focused on: (1) mean levels of emotional valence
and arousal, (2) day-to-day fluctuations (instability) in emotional valence and arousal, and (3) large deviations
in emotional valence and arousal from one’s own average (anomalies). For risk mitigation and alternate
strategies, we will examine the extent to which contextual variables (noise from the environment, location,
social factors) and psychosocial functioning influence predictive models. This project will support the
development of fine-grained and quantitative behavioral assessment tools to evaluate dysfunction in the
trajectories of mental illness (NIMH Obj 2.2) and elucidate additive, interactive combinations of data that can
identify dynamic risk (NIMH Obj 2.2A). Further, study findings have the potential to provide critical data on
personalized models of psychopathology with a focus on the emotion and mood dynamics."

Childhood asthma is a major risk factor for lung disease in adulthood, yet what causes some children, but not
others, to have a worse disease course, characterized by persistence of disease and decrements in lung function
growth, is unclear. Although some genetic factors have been linked to lung function trajectories, much of the
variability in disease course remains unexplained, suggesting that environmental factors are likely important in
shaping disease course. Several studies have demonstrated that exposure to higher concentrations of
particulate matter (PM) leads to worse lung function growth, but the effects of specific PM sources and
composition on disease course and lung function growth are largely unknown. Thus, our overarching
hypothesis is that exposure to PM from certain sources and of specific compositions predict persistence of
asthma severity and decrements in lung function growth. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective
cohort study of 300 multi-ethnic children, the Texas Home Assessment of Asthma and Lung Exposures
(TexHALE) study. We will repeatedly measure lung function, asthma severity, and PM exposure (sources,
composition, and concentrations) and examine associations between: 1) lung function growth; 2) persistence
of disease severity; and 3) biomarkers associated with airway remodeling and lung function decline with
PM exposure (sources, composition, and concentrations).The proposed aims will greatly advance our current
understanding of the natural history of asthma, which is critical for developing interventions that modify the
trajectory of childhood asthma. The proposed work will identify PM sources that are implicated in worse disease
course, providing evidence to extend current air pollution regulation to prioritize targeting certain sources.
Moreover, the findings will lend insight into racial and ethnic disparities in disease course, the potential
contribution of PM exposure to these disparities, and any disparate effects of PM exposure among racial and
ethnic minority populations."

 Dysfunction of the vascular blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebrovascular leakiness are
present during aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with the onset of
preclinical mild-cognitive impairment. Based on recent discoveries we have defined a highly
explanatory biological pathway that directly causes neural dysfunction and cognitive impairment
following BBB dysfunction. While it is intuitive that loss of function of the fundamental vascular
interface that protects the brain would be expected to cause neurological complications that
may contribute to AD, previously there has not been a clearly defined mechanism linking BBB
dysfunction to AD pathology. Existing data in humans suffer from limitations related to possible
regional differences in BBB leakage and the temporal characteristics of BBB disruption
particularly in relation to the deposition of the two proteins that have been implicated in AD
pathogenesis, -amyloid (A) and pathological aggregates of tau.
 Very few studies have examined how these pathological proteins are related to BBB
disruption, and there is no exploration of the four crucially different scenarios: (1) that there is no
relationship between AD pathological proteins and BBB disruption (2) that BBB disruption leads
to increased accumulation of these proteins or (3) that increased accumulation of these proteins
leads to BBB disruption. (4) AD protein pathologies and BBB disruption form a positive feedback
loop that originates with either and are related via the exacerbation of transmission/spread of
protein pathologies by conditions created by BBB disruption.
 In this study we will combine descriptive longitudinal data in cognitively normal humans
using PET scanning to obtain tau and A measurements and dynamic contrast enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to obtain BBB measurements, with studies in
transgenic mouse models of AD where we will manipulate the BBB. Together these studies will
probe mechanisms of AD pathogenesis in mouse models that enable dissecting the individual
contributions of BBB disruption, amyloid and tau by manipulating each separately, and human
studies that translate these basic findings to observations in the human situation of aging and
preclinical AD."

Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and
sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the
brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep
apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or
preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for
prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap
remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk
burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD
indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment.
The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level
framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on
the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup,
comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain
health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social
capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional
and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To
ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental
(household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital,
neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on
markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions
(attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite
and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and
inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk
of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which
amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related
brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel
home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic
systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining
observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks."

Hundreds to thousands of malignant epithelial clones with unique genetic compositions and fitness potentials
are present in lethal cancers. Each clone competes against one another and also against a hostile immune
microenvironment. Remarkable selective forces establish reservoirs of therapeutically resistant tumor cells and
lethal metastases. Mechanistically mapping the evolution of tumor heterogeneity is the next great challenge in
cancer research. Genomics approaches have been developed for digitizing heterogeneity in tumors and
inferring lineage trajectories. However, gold-standard spatial information relied upon by pathologists for
centuries is lost in these techniques and the inferred lineage relationships must still be proven experimentally.
For almost three decades, genetically encodable protein tags have been invaluable for lineage tracing cell-fate
in vivo. The discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) added the benefit of fluorescence microscopy.
Spectrally resolvable GFP derivatives further increased the combinatorial potential of lineage tracing. Using
techniques like “confetti” labelling, four clones are now commonly traced in most laboratories. Other
approaches have successfully traced a hundred clones (“Brainbow”). These status quo approaches have
remained unchanged for over a decade and still fall significantly short of the thousands of colors needed for
quantitatively mapping tumor heterogeneity. This proposal provides a solution in the form of a massively
combinatorial lineage tracing strategy in mice, termed “MousePaint”. This high-risk and high-reward IMAT
project is based upon decades of genetic research from a team with an established track-record in
combinatorial lineage tracing and hyperspectral imaging. MousePaint utilizes fluorescent proteins spanning
the entire visible spectrum. Downstream hyperspectral imaging is used to image thousands of lineages and
theoretically approach True Color imaging of >1 million colors. The objective of this proposal is to perform
feasibility studies on a “MousePaint” technology that can be used to paint and visualize thousands of tumor
clones during the natural history of a cancer – including initiation, growth, and metastasis. Two Aims are
proposed. (Aim 1) To optimize a MousePaint strategy for combinatorial imaging in vivo and (Aim
2) To engineer and test a genetically encodable MousePaint for quantitatively visualizing the
evolution of intratumor heterogeneity. Completing these aims will deliver MousePaints for imaging
tumor cell heterogeneity. Hyperspectral imaging and big data analysis will benchmark MousePaint lineage
tracing and color-depth. Co-registry of MousePaint with in situ transcriptomics, molecular pathology,
histopathology, and scRNAseq compatibilities will be directly tested. MousePaint is expected to transform
cancer research by providing a simple mouse tool for True Color imaging tumor evolution at least 100 to 1000
times the resolution of available methods."

medicine research workforce to advance health equity. Towards this goal, we propose an educational program
that provides diverse learners with didactic, methodological, and applied training in integrative medicine
research to reduce social disparities in health and healthcare. The IHEAR program will develop an initial
pathway for skilled, dedicated integrative medicine researchers by creating an early on-ramp. The curriculum
will include eight weeks of intensive training for eight predoctoral fellows recruited from a wide range of health
professions doctoral programs (e.g., acupuncture, medicine, naturopathy, nursing, osteopathy, pharmacy,
public health). The IHEAR program will include five components: (1) didactic training in social health and
healthcare disparities and the under-developed role of complementary and integrative health approaches; (2)
foundational research skills (e.g., formulating research questions, selecting research methods, interpreting
evidence); (3) ethical issues (e.g., barriers to diversity and inclusion in clinical research, issues of cultural
appropriation in integrative medicine); (4) professional career development; and (5) mentored, applied
research projects. IHEAR will be developed and implemented by experienced faculty at the Osher Center for
Integrative Medicine at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), leveraging the Osher Center's

10796788,"The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the
ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings,
the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach
financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and
corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older
adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday
life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective,
quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an
expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current
assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current
proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based
OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive
aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to
establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review
task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and
fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time
and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional
strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially
incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I
will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining
expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art
technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task
design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while
learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in
financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded
mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist,
and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation
for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize
financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s
mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”."

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect as many as 5.7 million Americans and will cost the
U.S. economy between $379 and $500 billion per year by 2040. Goal 5 of the 2020 update to the National Plan
to Address Alzheimer's, ""Improve data to track progress"", recognizes the need for increased surveillance of
ADRD. The goal states, ""Data and surveillance efforts are paramount to tracking the burden of ADRD … and
assist with understanding health disparities among populations such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-
income populations, rural residents, and sexual and gender minorities."" No data or surveillance system
currently exists for ADRD surveillance. However, Medicare and Medicaid data offer a promising source of
information to track ADRD diagnoses. Medicare covers most Americans over the age of 65, and Medicaid
covers long-term care services for people with ADRD. In 2016, the Data Infrastructure Committee of the
National Institute on Aging (NIA) identified ""ways to reduce the significant obstacles faced by researchers in
using medical care claims and encounter data"" as a primary NIA objective, highlighting the importance and
value of Medicare and Medicaid data. We propose to create a publicly accessible system to (1) track ADRD
diagnoses in Medicare and Medicaid; (2) conduct research to understand the correlation between diagnosed
and assessed dementia; and (3) demonstrate the value of the new system by using its data to evaluate an
important research question. In Aim 1, we propose to leverage an established set of partners and
methodologies to develop a publicly accessible system to monitor and surveil ADRD diagnoses in Medicare
and Medicaid, providing information at the national, state and county level and by age, sex, race/ethnicity,
comorbidity, eligibility and other characteristics and stratification factors. Medical claims do not identify all
persons living with dementia, so additional research is needed to understand the biases embedded in payment
claims information. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the predictive power of Medicare claims in identifying persons
with assessed dementia using linked data from Medicare and the nationally representative Health and
Retirement Study (HRS). Aim 2 will estimate the sensitivity and specificity of Medicare claims in detecting HRS
assessed dementia and explore differences across sociodemographic, health, and cognitive factors. Finally, in
Aim 3, we propose to use the new surveillance platform to perform a demonstration analysis; estimating rates
of COVID-19 mortality among patients diagnosed with ADRD in Medicare. When completed, the system we
describe will provide a much-needed ADRD surveillance system, vastly expanding access to and
understanding of Medicare and Medicaid ADRD information for the research community and general public."
10796891,"Gout, a metabolic condition causing the most common inflammatory arthritis, leads to excruciatingly painful
flares and joint damage. With urate a causal metabolite, gout risk is affected by lifestyle, and with increasingly
prevalent “western” lifestyles, the disease burden of gout has risen globally, now affecting 4% of US adults (>9
million) with rising emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Through NIH-funded research, we have made
significant advances in identifying lifestyle and genetic risk factors for gout, quantifying purported factors, and
discovering novel risk factors and new protective ones, as well as common genetic variants for incident gout.
Still, fundamental questions remain in the progression to clinical gout; prolonged hyperuricemia (HU) is
necessary, but not sufficient (only ~20% develop gout). Furthermore, the biology behind the distinctive sex
difference in gout (>3 times higher prevalence in men than women) remains largely unclear. To that end, the
metabolome represents a compelling target trait between genome and phenome to elucidate disease
mechanisms, predisposition, progression and prediction, especially for metabolic-inflammatory conditions like
gout. Indeed, certain metabolites are crucial for induction of trained immunity and regulation of inflammatory
gene expression, while others may suppress gouty inflammation, increase urate precipitation, or affect
proinflammatory status, all relevant pathways for progression from HU. Amongst the multiple gout-related
metabolomics studies, 6 from Asia, plus our new data from UK Biobank, have implicated branched-chain
amino acids cross-sectionally. Furthermore, sex hormone metabolites, while implicated in gout risk, also
affect the composition of gut microbiota, which can, in turn, modulate circulating sex hormone levels.
Moreover, gout patients showed depletions of bacteria that can lower urate levels through uricolysis, as well
as butyrate, a short chain free fatty acid metabolite capable of reducing gouty inflammation. While
highly promising, it remains unknown if these omics profiles contribute to gout risk or represent ‘markers’ of
established gout (reverse causation) or confounding, and their generalizability beyond Asia or males is unclear.
Building on our prior R01 success and fruitful track record of long-term metabolomics research in the
Health Professionals Follow-up Study and two Nurses’ Health Studies, this competing renewal proposes to
conduct the first prospective, population-based metabolomics study of incident gout with external validation
in a diverse cohort (ARIC, with 62% African Americans) and causal inference analysis (Aim 1), and clarify the
roles of gut microbiota (Aim 2), with decades of confirmed gout cases and rich lifestyle exposure/biomarker
data. We aim to determine pivotal omics in gout risk, analogous to established, strongly causal metabolites
(e.g., cholesterol for coronary events). The identified factors hold the promise of new prevention and treatment
options as well as novel predictive tools for gout beyond urate, including progression from HU to clinical gout
(primary prevention) or possibly risk of recurrent flares to guide holistic gout care (secondary prevention)."

 The striatum is central to motivated behaviors and goal-directed actions. Neuromodulation by
acetylcholine (ACh) plays a major role in regulating striatal circuits and resulting behaviors. ACh levels within
the striatum are the highest in the CNS. Cholinergic transmission is involved in multiple basal ganglia based
functions including the control of voluntary movement, motor and associative learning, as well as reward.
Dysfunctions in acetylcholine (ACh) signaling in the striatum are associated with a variety of neurological
movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and dystonia. Identifying how
these dysfunctions occur is limited by a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of cholinergic
transmission. While both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are expressed in the striatum, ACh does not
directly evoke post-synaptic events at most synapses that can be detected with conventional
electrophysiological approaches. Instead cholinergic receptors modulate striatal inputs or indirectly alter the
excitability of post-synaptic neurons through multistep intracellular cascades. This proposal will examine the
dynamics of ACh at muscarinic synapses using the viral expression of GIRK channels that was developed in
the last funding period. The dynamics of ACh will be compared in control and disease states following loss of
dopamine. The proposed studies are expected to be significant in that they have to potential to determine

10799557,"The goal of this project is to decipher how various liver injuries and disorders can
accelerate and exacerbate development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one leading cause
of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The immediate focus is on elucidating the tumorigenic
liver damages generated ironically by loss of pro-oncogenic molecules in hepatocytes. In recent
experiments, we found that deletion of Shp2/Ptpn11, previously known to be pro-oncogenic,
aggravated HCC development induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) or by Pten deficiency and
NASH. Consistently, several other groups reported that targeted removal of oncoproteins, such
as c-Met, Ikkb, and b-catenin, from hepatocytes indeed aggravated HCC induced by DEN or
other oncogenic drivers. However, the underlying mechanisms for the anti-oncogenic effect of
these oncoproteins are unclear. Our hypothesis is that loss of the pro-oncogenic molecules
generates a variety of tumor-promoting factors in the liver microenvironment, resulting in
exacerbated tumorigenesis. Of note, these mouse tumor models closely recapitulate many
aspects of the pathogenic process in liver cancer patients. Therefore, we believe that common
mechanisms or oncogenic liver disorders are shared between the mouse models and human
patients in tumor initiation and progression. On this project, we will pursue a comprehensive
analysis of the molecular and cellular events that drive hepato-carcinogenesis using several
mouse models. We propose the following three Specific Aims: 1) to search and identify
tumorigenic factors in livers deficient for c-Met, Ikkb, Shp2 or b-catenin; 2) to determine the
mutation profiles and HCC initiation in these mutants; and 3) to characterize DEN-induced and
spontaneous tumorigenesis in liver deficient for both Shp2 and Ikkb. Success of this project will
decipher common and distinctive mechanisms that drive liver tumorigenesis, and will facilitate
design of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for liver cancer."

SUMMARY
 pregnancy outcomes, including premature birth and stillbirth, are the leading causes of neonatal
and mortality. A frequent cause of preterm birth and stillbirth is intrauterine infection, which occurs
bacteria ascend from the vagina into the uterus and invade the amniotic cavity, leading to inflammation,
damage, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one such bacterium
with ascending infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The principal risk factor for this is
vaginal colonization; however the mechanisms by which GBS persist i n the 
and ascend to the uterus remain unknown. GBS colonization status is intermittent and can be transient,
reflecting a combination of GBS determinants, antagonism by commensal flora, and host immune
, female genital tract
responses. The current proposal seeks to address these dynamic aspects of GBS vaginal carriage, specifically
1) bacterial adherence to host cells/tissue of the FGT, 2) competition with vaginal microbiota, and 3) evasion of
host defense. Recent studies have demonstrated that GBS stimulates vaginal epithelial exfoliation by
activating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to loss of barrier function and GBS
dissemination to the upper FGT and fetus. We have recently discovered a GBS surface adhesin, BspC, that
directly interacts with host intermediate filaments, including keratin 19 and vimentin, a canonical marker of
EMT. We hypothesize that when EMT is induced the BspC-vimentin interaction plays an important role in GBS
vaginal persistence and ascending infection. We have further discovered that GBS has a type VII secretion
system (T7SS) that contributes to colonization. We hypothesize that T7SS is important for competition with
vaginal microbiota for niche establishment and secreting anti-eukaryotic toxins that may invoke a host immune
response. We have also demonstrated that IL-17A is produced during GBS colonization and that IL-17+ cells,
such as MAITs and  T cells, actually contributed to GBS ascending spread. We hypothesize that
IL-17
induced
BspC-vimentin These hypotheses will be addressed in the following
specific aims: AIM 1: Elucidate the contribution of BspC and intermediate filaments to GBS vaginal
persistence, AIM 2: Examine the function of newly discovered GBS T7SS in mediating vaginal niche
establishment and inter-bacterial competition, AIM 3: Determine the contribution of IL-17 and MAITs to the
pathogenesis of GBS colonization. These studies should increase our understanding of the bacterial and host
factors involved in the colonization and persistence within the FGT that impact GBS ascending infection and
neonatal disease.
IL-17 and
producing T cells in the FGT induce EMT and barrier breakdown. This comes full circle; Once EMT is
as a defensive response to initiate cellular exfoliation, GBS hijacks this process, possibly through a
interaction, to persistent in the FGT."
10798665,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a leading cause of infectious death
worldwide. Although tuberculosis generally remains confined to the lung, pathogenic
mycobacteria also can disseminate to other tissues, resulting in some of the most
dangerous manifestations of the infection. The interplay of bacterial and host factors that
contribute to dissemination is incompletely understood. Beginning with an outbreak
strain presenting with high rates of extrapulmonary dissemination and an extremely high
rate of tuberculous bone disease, we identified a full-length vavriant of the Type VII
secretion system substrate EsxM as an important component of the clinical phenotype.
EsxM was intact in the outbreak strain and so-called “ancestral lineages” but truncated in
modern Mtb strains. The active version of EsxM modulates the motility of infected
macrophages leading to dissemination, but has been compromised in “modern-lineage”
Mtb strains. The work proposed here will 1) interrogate the mechanisms by which the
bacterial secreted effector EsxM modulates the behavior of infected macrophages; 2)
identify how EsxM and its closely related paralogs are regulated in the bacteria during
infection, including investigating non-redundant roles for the closely-related paralogs;
and 3) translate these findings into murine and zebrafish models of dissemination and
bone disease. These studies will provide insights into the bacterial genetic regulators of
dissemination of infection, a fundamentally important question in our understanding of
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases."
10798856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Management of prostate cancer remains a daunting challenge. Many men with prostate cancer will not die
from it—even without any intervention—either due to competing risks of death or because of the indolent
nature of their tumors. Yet, it is also the second most common cause of cancer death in men. Ongoing
uncertainty about whether and how to treat the disease has resulted in tremendous variation in its
management and an outsized influence of non-clinical factors, such as financial incentives. A striking feature of
the current healthcare landscape is the increasing consolidation of physician practices. The rapid shift towards
both vertical (i.e., hospital-physician partnerships) and horizontal (i.e., physician groups combining to form
larger groups) integration of urology practices will almost certainly influence how prostate cancer is managed,
though the implications are uncertain. Through centralization of care, and economies of scale that boost
infrastructure and resources for healthcare delivery, consolidation may result in better coordination of care,
focused service lines, and robust quality improvement efforts. For men with prostate cancer, this could help
ensure consistent implementation of guideline concordant active surveillance care, or appropriate monitoring of
targeted therapies for advanced disease. But consolidation also invariably reduces market competition,
allowing such practices to negotiate higher third-party payments (i.e., commercial prices). The resulting
financial incentives may promote utilization, fostering physician behavior that spills over to the Medicare
population. Independent of the nature of consolidation, its implications for access to prostate cancer care are
also uncertain. On one hand, consolidation may impair access (e.g., requiring longer distance travel) for men
previously served by acquired rural practices. On the other hand, it may improve access of these men to higher
quality, high volume physicians and hospitals. We therefore propose a study to better understand relationships
between urology practice consolidation and prostate cancer care with the following aims: 1) To measure the
effect of vertical urology practice consolidation on quality of prostate cancer care, 2) To assess the effect of
horizontal urology practice consolidation on quality of prostate cancer care, and 3) To determine the effect of
urology practice consolidation on access to prostate cancer care. This study will shed light on relationships
between physician practice consolidation, and delivery of care for an exceedingly common cancer. These
issues have been virtually unstudied to date and have implications for specialty care in other disciplines that
are experiencing similar trends in consolidation. Findings will have real-world implications for patients, who are
naturally interested in getting the best prostate cancer care."

steeper cognitive decline and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in regions that are predilection sites for AD
pathology (Bangen et al., 2018; Bangen et al., in prep). Identifying individuals who are most likely to decline
prior to the occurrence of significant brain changes is essential so that interventions can be applied before
extensive cerebrovascular lesions and cognitive changes develop. Studies investigating incipient cognitive and
brain changes prior to the development of dementia are critical to optimize brain health and improve outcomes.
 Most previous neuroimaging studies of brain changes underlying cognitive dysfunction in T2DM have
applied conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect end-stage macrostructural
changes associated with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) such as white matter lesions (WML). However, recent
advances in MRI have allowed for the development of sensitive methods for the non-invasive measurement of
CBF and cerebral arterial compliance (AC), or the ability of vessels to distend or increase in volume in
response to changes in blood pressure. Such methods may help elucidate mechanisms that precede the
development of irreversible parenchymal/structural damage and may yield important markers of risk for
cognitive decline. Although T2DM has been associated with peripheral arterial stiffening using carotid-femoral
pulse wave velocity, no studies have examined intracranial arterial stiffening (i.e., decreased AC) in T2DM.
 We therefore propose to advance the field by longitudinally assessing neuropsychological functioning, AC
and CBF, and established MRI markers CVD in a sample of 150 older adults (aged 65-85) including 100 with
T2DM and 50 non-diabetic control participants. Participants will undergo comprehensive neuropsychological
assessment; laboratory testing to assess blood-based markers related to glycemia and cardiometabolic health;
and neuroimaging exams including high resolution structural imaging and novel arterial spin labeling (ASL)

24-month follow up. Our goals are to investigate whether early changes in cerebrovascular functioning (i.e.,
reduced AC and CBF) relate to MRI markers of CVD lesions and cognition in T2DM. We will also investigate
whether diabetes related factors (e.g., duration, glycemic control) and comorbid cardiometabolic conditions
(e.g., hypertension) moderate associations between AC, CBF, CVD markers, and cognition. Findings will help
address an important public health need by identifying markers of cognitive decline in T2DM and elucidating
potentially modifiable mechanisms underlying these changes. Results may also assist in facilitating targeted

10800686,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major public health problem
that is rising in prevalence with the aging population and the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and
hypertension. HFpEF accounts for around 50% of all heart failure (HF) cases with a prevalence
of at least 3 million in the U.S. HFpEF is associated with high morbidity and mortality. After HF
hospitalization, the 5-year survival of HFpEF is a dismal 35%, which is worse than most cancers.
In addition, quality of life in HFpEF is as poor or worse than HF with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF). A series of large-scale clinical trials has been conducted, but most of them only provided
neutral result and failed to prove the efficacy of treatments. The alarming trend of HFpEF with
lack of effective therapies for patients constitutes a major public health problem.
 Recent studies have attributed this failure to distinct systemic nature of HFpEF syndrome
and proposing sub-phenotypes within the heterogeneous HFpEF syndrome, which highlighted
the increasing need for better-targeted therapies to specific HFpEF subtypes. The seemingly
disparate but complex interrelated phenotypes, along with comorbidities, lifestyle and
environmental factors, make the multi-organ syndrome best beneficial from a big data approach.
However, conventional studies usually only included limited cross-sectional clinical symptoms,
lab results and/or gross measurements on cardiac imaging to investigate HFpEF, overlooking the
rich temporal information from electronic health record (EHR) and detailed spatial information
reserved in imaging.
 In this proposal, we will introduce advance shape analysis method to extract novel image
features and biomarker from CMR images and validate at population level (Aim 1). We will then
combine image information with multi-dimensional temporal EHR data to jointly identify clinically
significant HFpEF subclasses (i.e. phenotyping) using state-of-art machine learning technique
(Aim 2). Towards therapeutic goals based on phenotyping, we will further investigate optimal
treatment strategies with current available agents using deep reinforcement learning (RL) based
on massive EHR data to meet the pressing need before ongoing trials provide sufficient evidence
on new drugs with proved clinical efficacy (Aim 3). Furthermore, we will develop an online, open-
access platform to facilitating the sharing of code, data and knowledge of this study (Aim 4). We
believe this research can improve our understanding, phenotyping and management of HFpEF,
which might positively ease the clinical and economic burdens in turn both in U.S. and worldwide."

Crohn's disease is a chronic illness that results in intestinal inflammation and unwanted gastrointestinal
symptoms. The only biologic (monoclonal antibody) approved for moderate to severe Crohn's disease in children
(<18 years old) are those that antagonize tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF). While there is a high initial
response rate to labeled infliximab (anti-TNF) dosing, only half of infliximab exposed patients will achieve clinical
remission and less than 40% will achieve endoscopic healing after one year on therapy. Several studies have
shown that rates of sustained corticosteroid-free remission are improved when patients receive anti-TNF dose
optimizations following reactive or proactive therapeutic drug monitoring. Moreover, anti-TNF dose intensification
following pharmacodynamic monitoring has led to improved rates of endoscopic (intestinal) healing. Therefore,
given the limited therapeutic options for children with active Crohn's disease, there is a critical unmet need for
the development of a data-driven, individualized, and scalable anti-TNF dosing intervention used from drug start
and continued throughout therapy to optimize drug exposure and ultimately, improve rates of intestinal healing.
Our team has developed a precision dosing strategy that uses an innovative physician decision support
dashboard that instantaneously applies pharmacokinetic model-informed precision dosing to generate an
individual infliximab dosing regimen starting with induction and targeting phase-specific pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic endpoints throughout therapy. The central hypothesis is precision dosing (intervention arm)
with infliximab during induction and maintenance will improve rates of deep remission vs. conventional care
(pragmatic dosing; control arm). The central hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. Aim1: Conduct a
cluster-randomized (by center) clinical trial to assess rates of deep remission at year1 between Crohn's
disease patients receiving infliximab with precision dosing vs. conventional care. Aim2: Refine model-
informed precision dosing using a continuous learning approach and identify anti-TNF PK/PD targets
from induction to maintenance associated with deep remission. Our approach is conceptually innovative
with an emphasis on practical implementation. This is the first clinical trial in children to provide anti-TNF dose
optimization during induction to target a specific early (week6) trough concentration while the maintenance
regimen is selected by specific treat-to-target pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Additionally,
precision dosing regimens are produced with a novel web-based decision support dashboard and the study is
being performed within the ImproveCareNow Network to streamline clinical trial logistics. In Aim2, a continuous
learning approach will be applied to our published pharmacokinetic model to iteratively refine the model by
capturing new real-world data to better describe specific patient populations and further reduce prediction error.
The long-term goal is for the precision dosing strategy to generate a paradigm shift as the preferred dosing
approach to optimize exposure to all biologics and change the natural history of Crohn's disease."

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) affects 1-8 in 1000 live births. Therapeutic
hypothermia (TH) improves survival but 35% of surviving treated neonates have significant
residual disability. Monitoring of HIE at the bedside currently relies on neurological exam,
ultrasound, and aEEG, but these methods do not adequately identify hypothermia non-
responders. Multiple biomarkers have been tested for prediction of neurological outcome,
however none have translated into a clinically used test to guide therapy or to predict prognosis.
In part this is because markers may be blocked by the blood brain barrier or non-specific to the
central nervous system (CNS). PA-18-485 highlights that the development of “biomarkers to
provide accurate estimate of the timing, nature and extent of brain injury for infants at risk for
neonatal encephalopathy” is a critical research goal of the NICHD. Assay development and
neuroprotective treatment must be tailored to the unique clinical phases of HIE: acute (0-6 hrs),
latent (6-12 hrs), secondary (12-72 hrs) & tertiary (>72 hrs). Central nervous system-derived
exosomes (CNSEs) are nanovesicles that freely cross the blood brain barrier and contain
surface markers from their cell of origin (neurons/astrocytes); purification of CNSEs essentially
allows non-invasive sampling of the neonatal CNS without contamination from non-CNS
sources. We hypothesize that CNSE based assays from the acute, latent and early secondary
clinical phases of HIE in term neonates can a) predict short term clinical outcomes (vEEG) as
well as MRI changes associated with neurodevelopmental (ND) outcomes at 2-years and b)
identify the relative contribution of various pathologic processes to adverse outcomes in the
individual neonate. Further, we hypothesis that CNSE based assays can be used to quantify the
effects of therapeutic neuroprotectants in target cells (neurons/astrocytes) in real time,
potentially augmenting future HIE pharmacology studies."

Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) involving basic and clinical translational CV science using cellular,
small animal, and single and multi-center population cohort and clinical trials. Key features of this proposed
T32 training program include: 1) pairing each trainee with an externally funded research mentor whose
research focuses on CVD; 2) outstanding multidisciplinary faculty who are experienced in training young
investigators and can quickly establish this T32 program for fostering successful progress in academic
medicine; 3) access to multiple phenotypic and biologic materials from major NIH-funded basic science,
prospective cohort, or clinical trials at VCU through the supporting program faculty; 4) courses provided by the
existing graduate school and medical faculty that supplement areas of CV research not previously experienced
by trainees; and 5) two institutional seminar programs that enhances interaction among individuals from
multiple disciplines. The proposed training program includes 15 faculty from 7 departments; these faculty
currently mentor 11 individuals who meet the program eligibility criteria. Each has NIH or VA extramural
funding; strong institutional support in the form of financial resources, facilities, and equipment; robust
integration with the VCU Center of Health Disparities for recruiting and training minority scientists; and support
for key professional development activities such as presentations and grant and manuscript writing. The
ultimate goal of this T32 training program is to attract and train a cohort of outstanding academic scientists
fluent in the latest developments of CV multidisciplinary translational research, who will then apply this
knowledge to design and lead future studies regarding important questions in cardiovascular health. The

10800437,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the US, for which
treatment remains basically unchanged in the past three decades. Although patients often die from metastatic
lesions, there are no specific diagnostic markers or therapeutic strategies aimed at treating metastases,
particularly due to an almost complete lack of knowledge on the molecular drivers of metastatic progression.
Using differential gene expression analysis of matched primary tumors and metastasis from genetically
engineered mouse models of PDA, a novel functional soft-agar screen, and subsequent validation studies in
human specimens we identified a novel glutathione-related metabolic pathway specifically activated in
metastatic cells. Critically, inducible ablation of two key factors in the pathway, Gstt1 (glutathione S-transferase
theta 1) and the aminoacid transporter Slc38a4, that are specifically expressed in metastatic lesions,
completely halted the growth of metastases without affecting the primary tumors; these genes are only
expressed in normal liver cells, suggesting that metastatic cells co-opt this pathway and repurpose it for
metabolic fitness; furthermore, preliminary data indicate that such adaptation drives a novel conjugating activity
(glutathyonylation) of matrix proteins including fibronectin 1 (Fn1) to allow metastatic cells to better expand
within the extracellular matrix (ECM), all together indicating that these lesions evolve by acquiring non-genetic
adaptations. In this proposal, we will take advantage of biochemistry, cell biology, genetically-engineered
mouse models and samples from human patients in order to molecularly characterize these factors, with the
potential to change treatment for this devastating disease."

Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is a powerful technology now FDA approved for several ablative brain therapies, and
has demonstrated an impressive safety and efficacy profile for treating diseases such as essential tremor.
Beyond ablation, early human studies demonstrate efficacy and safety of noninvasive microbubble-mediated
blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption with FUS for advanced therapeutic applications. In this high-risk, high-
reward biomedical engineering project, we have assembled a uniquely qualified team to explore novel
applications of FUS to improve Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for glioblastoma (GBM)
treatment. CAR-Ts are a promising new treatment platform that allows directed targeting and killing of tumor
cells. Locally administered CAR-Ts have demonstrated promising efficacy against GBM. However, like
chemotherapeutic agents, systemically administered CAR-Ts suffer from limited access to the brain. We and
others have demonstrated applications of focused ultrasound (FUS) with FDA approved microbubbles to amplify
the deposition of ultrasound energy into tissue, inducing a variety of biological effects. Under certain ultrasound
conditions, FUS can temporarily and reversibly alter the permeability of the BBB to deliver exogenous
compounds into the brain, which has been demonstrated in preclinical models and early-stage clinical trials in
humans. We have developed an ultrasound image-guided FUS therapeutic platform specific for rodents, capable
of consistent and accurate targeting of BBB disruption and delivery of therapeutics to the brain, a necessary
requirement for the proposed studies. Furthermore, we have identified the immunoregulatory protein B7-H3 as
an attractive CAR-T target which is highly expressed in clinical GBM isolates but not in normal tissue. We have
developed both murine B7-H3.CAR-Ts, which demonstrate efficacy in xenograft models, and human B7-
H3.CAR-Ts, which are currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials for safety and antitumor activity at our
facility. Our team is therefore in a unique position to study the potential application of FUS to improve CAR-T
therapy for GBM. Specifically, we hypothesize that FUS-mediated BBB disruption will result in increased
trafficking of systemically administered B7-H3.CAR-Ts to GBM tumors; and FUS therapy will improve overall
anti-tumor efficacy of B7-H3.CAR-Ts by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These
hypotheses will be addressed by 1) first establishing the effects of FUS with varying parameters to increase
trafficking of B7-H3.CAR-Ts to GBM tumors, 2) determining B7-H3.CAR-T biodistribution, proliferation and
persistence over time following systemic administration with FUS therapy, and finally 3) a pilot study to determine
the impact of FUS therapy on the tumor immune microenvironment and how those changes augment B7-
H3.CAR-T efficacy. Success of this biomedical engineering project would pave the way for further technology
development as well as exploration and clinical translation of the synergy of these two relatively new and powerful
technologies to make a substantial impact in the lives of GBM patients."

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial groups in the United States, with
over 6 million Americans currently living with congestive heart failure (CHF). Nationally, African American (AA) men
have the highest CHF death rates of all races. AAs have a higher prevalence, a higher 5-year risk of mortality after initial
diagnosis than Caucasians, an increased hospitalization risk, and a 30% increased risk of 1-year mortality if they have two
or more hospitalizations within any year. Prevalence and mortality risk are nearing twice the national average in many
Arkansas counties. Arkansas also has the third highest concentration of CHF death rates of all 50 states. Furthermore, care
delivery systems (i.e., hospitals, and nurses) are struggling to balance the needs of CHF patients against the variability of
unplanned critical care needs in the ongoing, large-scale communicable disease outbreaks. However, the routine,
preventive, and urgent care needs of AAs with CHF can not be deprioritized because of health system inelasticity. If so,
health disparities in AAs will be further exacerbated. Since the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to care delivery (i.e., the same
level of resources provided to all patients) is clinically ineffective and wasteful, the efficient allocation of clinical
resources (e.g., nurses) fuels the need for more innovative, evidence-based and nurse-led approaches to stratifying risks
among AA patients. Risk stratification provides a systematic, equity-driven method of assessing and prioritizing patients,
allocating high-intensity resources for patients who need care the most. Yet, the clinical roles that are heavily associated
with decreasing hospitalizations by 84% (i.e., RNs) are found on the care delivery teams of AAs at a rate of 50% less than
that of Caucasian patients with CHF in Arkansas, a dyer health equity problem. Therefore, the primary objective of this
study is to construct a comprehensive sociotechnical framework for risk stratification (i.e., care delivery team composition
model, risk guidelines, and a usable risk index/score for care delivery), supporting equitable care delivery of AAs with
CHF. Our success will (1) reveal how nurses and care delivery teams influence care outcomes and provide evidenced-
based recommendations on composing care delivery teams/models that are associated with decreased hospitalization,
increased days between readmission, and decreased care charges, and (2) advance the role of nursing practice is stratifying
hospitalization risks of African Americans with CHF."
10793607,"Establishing the influence of pollutants on genome function is essential in defining their impact on
human health. Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxic metalloid that leads to carcinogenesis. The World
Health Organization estimates that over 100 million people worldwide are at risk to drinking arsenic
contaminated water. Recent studies indicate that arsenic alters gene expression leading to tumorigenesis.
Proper gene regulation is essential for normal growth, development and etiology of diseases such as cancer.
Eukaryotic DNA stored as chromatin whose basic repeating unit is the nucleosome, plays an integral role in
gene regulation. Previously, we (and others) showed that nucleosome locations within promoters play critical
roles in chromatin accessibility, thus controlling gene activity. Consequently, chromatin accessibility is an
essential component in gene regulation yet is not fully understood. Chromatin accessibility is modulated by
several key epigenetic factors: histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), DNA methylation, nucleosome
position/occupancy, transcription factors and chromatin architectural proteins (CAPs). We showed recently that
in addition to the above, incorporation of histone variants (the elusive H2B), into chromatin play a significant
role in arsenic-mediated diseases pathology, yet a mechanistic understanding of their impact is unknown.
These histone variants differ by just one to maximally three amino acids from the canonical H2B histone and
are highly expressed in cancers, suggesting that they could act as `oncohistones'. Thus it is critically important
to understand how and why these histone variants get expressed (aim 1); how their chromatin integration
impacts chromatin structural dynamics (aim 2) and integration regulate the chromatin state and gene
expression during arsenic exposure to drive carcinogenesis (aim3). Our interdisciplinary, broad approach will
establish unique comprehensive functional and mechanistic insight into histone H2B variant expression,
chromatin integration and disease pathology. Further it will provide a detailed understanding of the interplay
between arsenic-induced epigenetic changes and chromatin in the mammalian cell. We have developed novel
systems that will provide an unprecedented and unique opportunity to discover the functional and mechanistic

 Currently, about 4 million Americans are living with the effects of stroke, but there is no
effective treatment to improve functional recovery. The stroke-damaged site is especially
cytotoxic to neurons because of the high susceptibility to reactive oxygen species and pro-
inflammatory enzymes. It was recently realized that cellular secretome may be the major
contributor during stem cell therapy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), the membrane-bound
microvesicles, represent an active component of the cell secretome. And a major contributor to
the activity of EVs is the microRNA cargo. Since 2013, derivation of brain organoids from human
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has emerged as a promising approach for mimicking three-
dimensional human brain tissue. However, current knowledge on the therapeutic benefits of EVs
secreted by iPSC-derived brain organoids is limited.
 The objectives of this research are to engineer EVs of brain organoids derived from human
iPSCs (iNPCo) and investigate the impacts of iNPCo-secreted EVs on the survival, biosynthesis
of trophic factors and extracellular matrices, and functional neural differentiation in vitro and in
vivo. The central hypothesis is that iNPCo, unlike naïve iPSCs and monolayer neural progenitors,
secrete EVs carrying brain-specific microRNA cargo that can target ischemic brain tissue both by
providing neuroprotection from injury and by promoting recovery after injury; in particular, heparin-
hyaluronic acid hydrogel encapsulation will allow for the sustained delivery of iNPCo-EVs in the
ischemic environment, promoting their therapeutic effects. Based on these hypotheses, we
propose three aims: (1) Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that iNPCo-EVs express exosomal markers
and promote cell survival under oxidative stress in vitro; (2) Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the
microRNAs in iNPCo-EVs regulate the Wnt pathway and the secretion of trophic factors and
extracellular matrices to stimulate neurogenesis in vitro; and (3) Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
iNPCo-EVs promote in situ neural differentiation and tissue regeneration in an ischemic stroke
model. To date, no EV study has been performed for brain organoids derived from human iPSCs yet.
The novelty of our study in contrast to previous EV study is the use of three-dimensional brain
region-specific organoid system and the tunable heparin-hyaluronic acid hydrogel encapsulation
for therapeutic EV delivery. This project will advance our understanding of the effects of paracrine
signaling on neural regeneration and establish a transformative approach to modulate
extracellular microenvironment to attenuate ischemic-associated neuropathology toward the goal
of promoting neural regeneration through novel therapeutics."

The development of acute kidney (AKI) injury in hospitalized patients may be catastrophic. In general, the in-
hospital mortality rate for patients with AKI has been estimated between 20% to 25%. AKI prolongs
hospitalization, increases costs, and requires the utilization of additional resources. Drugs are implicated in
roughly one-quarter of hospitalized patients who develop AKI, and roughly half of the cases are related to
antibiotics. While broad spectrum antibiotics are essential to treat infections, they carry risk. Clinicians can alter
modifiable risk factors, but many patients are inherently at an increased risk of AKI. The exact molecular
mechanisms of antibiotic induced AKI are unclear, but emerging data supports oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction. Melatonin, a hormonal dietary supplement, has antioxidant properties via the nuclear factor erythroid
2–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway and can also restore mitochondrial bioenergetics. As such, melatonin is an
attractive option for kidney protection.
This proposal will test the hypothesis that melatonin reduces the risk of antibiotic-associated AKI through
activation of the NRF2 transcriptional pathway and balancing of mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. To
test this hypothesis, we propose a translational strategy to investigate mechanism and efficacy in parallel. First,
in our in vitro studies, we will expose human renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells to nephrotoxic antibiotics in the
presence /absence of melatonin. RPT cells will include control cells as well as those with disrupted NRF2 and
KEAP1 function. Analyses will include 1) targeted biomarkers of mitochondrial/cellular health and 2)
transcriptomics to identify complementary and alternative reno-protective pathways. Next, we will enroll 300
hospitalized patients prescribed vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and randomize them 1:1 to melatonin
5 mg or matched placebo. Whole blood will be analyzed for gene expression (NRF2/KEAP1) and plasma to
evaluate antibiotic and melatonin biodistribution. Further, traditional and novel biomarkers of kidney injury and
mitochondrial stress will be assessed. The studies described in the two aims will provide evidence to support
the use of melatonin and provide evidence of the mechanism."
10792749,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Low bone mineral density (BMD) is an innocuous and pernicious disease that eventually results in osteopenia
and osteoporosis, and increased risk for osteoporotic fractures. These fractures result in increased morbidity
due to pain, decreased locomotion, loss of income, and increased healthcare cost. Hip fractures have been
associated with increased mortality, with up to 35% 3-year mortality rate. Unfortunately, most patients at risk
for fractures are not screened for low BMD using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). There is a need to
identify patients with low BMD to institute therapy/treatment to prevent the development of fractures.
Approximately 280 million radiographs are performed annually in the United States. Our central hypothesis is
that deep learning analysis of these radiographs could provide information about the underlying patient bone
quality and predict whether a patient is osteoporotic or osteopenic. The long-term goals are (1) to identify
imaging biomarkers (radiomic features) that are associated with osteoporosis and osteopenia and (2) to
identify imaging biomarkers that predict underlying trabecular bone scores (TBS). This proposal utilizes cutting
edge computational and statistical approaches based on radiographs of patients with concurrent DXA studies.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) determine key reproducible imaging
biomarkers (radiomic features) of bones from radiographs in patients without implanted metallic devices that
could be used to reliably predict whether a patient has osteoporosis or osteopenia; (2) identify imaging
biomarkers (radiomic features) of bones from radiographs in patients with implanted metallic devices that could
be used to reliably predict whether a patient has osteoporosis or osteopenia; (3) determine whether these
imaging biomarkers from radiographs could be used to predict the bone TBS. These aims will be pursued
using novel computational and statistical techniques from the imaging sciences. We will identify imaging
features from radiographs that can predict whether a patient has osteoporosis or osteopenia and who should
go on to further screening with DXA, which would be a significant advancement for clinical healthcare. We also
aim to identify imaging features that can predict TBS, which provides additional information about the bone
microarchitecture and future fracture risk. The impact of this work is that we will have a better understanding of
the manifestations of osteoporosis and osteopenia from radiographs. The results of this work will identify
patients who have undergone radiographs who should go on to have formal DXA evaluation because of their
increased risk for osteoporosis and osteopenia."
10792827,"One of the biggest obstacles for patients seeking to break an opioid addiction is overcoming their physical dependence on the drug, which can cause extreme withdrawal symptoms, including nausea, diarrhea, bone and muscle pain, tachycardia, hypertension, fever, and chills. Relief from withdrawal symptoms is a common cause for patient relapse, and the fear of a negative withdrawal experience is a major barrier to voluntary discontinuation of opioid use (Pergolizzi 2020). Methadone is a commonly prescribed medication for opioid use disorders (OUDs) that has been shown to decrease mortality and improve OUD treatment retention (Suen 2022, Santos 2021), but anywhere from 30% to 80% of patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) respond poorly to treatment (Fonseca et al., 2011). A major reason for this wide range of response is the genetic variability of metabolism. Slow metabolism can lead to drug accumulation and negative side effects, while high metabolism can rapidly deplete therapeutic concentrations of methadone and lead to withdrawal and/or additional drug use (Kharasch, 2017). Individual metabolic differences can result in a 17-fold variation in methadone serum levels for a given dose (Eap et al., 2002), yet current practice is to follow a general algorithm for methadone dose adjustments that restricts dose increases to 5 to 10 mg without regard for metabolism. This proposed FastTrack project aims to develop and commercialize a new science-based approach for methadone dosing adjustments that uses novel, non-invasive point-of-care technology to evaluate small blood samples taken from patients using the well-established finger prick method and quickly evaluate the methadone rate of metabolism via a proprietary sensor to enable better, individualized methadone dosing decisions. In Phase I of the project, we will demonstrate the technical feasibility to accurately detect and measure methadone levels in a small validation study with screen printed electrode-based sensors. In Phase II of the project, we will confirm those results by developing a proof- of-concept device to conduct a small-scale feasibility study that will inform the design of the commercial version. A pre-pivotal clinical study with the commercial-grade device will then be conducted to evaluate device performance. This will be followed by a clinical trial pivotal study to correlate the commercial-grade device’s methadone metabolism measurements with the current gold standard, the cumbersome and untimely trough and peak analysis. Additional activities will take place to prepare the CARI system for regulatory clearance.  If successful, the CARI solution has the potential to dramatically improve the benefit-risk profile of MMT treatment by providing methadone dosing guidance that is much faster, less onerous, and more widely adopted than currently used methods. With more accurate metabolism-informed methadone dosing for OUD treatment, it is expected that patients will experience fewer withdrawal systems, improving their perception of care and patient retention rates, thereby reducing the rates of relapse and overdose."

In the United States, the incidence of urinary stone disease (USD) is rapidly increasing, affecting 8.8% of the
population in 2010, up from 2.6% in 1968, with half of patients exhibiting recurrent episodes. Calcium oxalate
stones comprise approximately 80% of USD cases and oxalate metabolism is provided exclusively by gut
bacteria. The canonical hypothesis for the increase in USD incidence is that a single oxalate-degrading species,
Oxalobacter formigenes, is sufficient to reduce urinary oxalate excretion enough to prevent calcium oxalate
stone formation and is lost due to oral antibiotic use. However, in a paradigm-shifting series of studies, we have
found that 1) O. formigenes is neither necessary nor sufficient to reduce urinary oxalate excretion or prevent
USD; 2) Oral antibiotics increase the risk of USD regardless of their effect on O. formigenes; 3) A functionally
diverse oxalate-degrading microbial network (ODMN) is responsible for oxalate metabolism rather than a single
species; 4) The ODMN prevents the toxic effects of exogenous oxalate on the host and the microbiome; and 5)
The ODMN is negatively associated with oral antibiotics in both animal models and in a clinical cohort of USD
patients. Given these new data, it is critical to further understand how the ODMN maintains a homeostatic
environment relative to oxalate and contributes to the prevention of USD. The objective of the current proposal
is to establish the host-microbe mechanisms through which the ODMN facilitates persistent oxalate metabolism
in vivo to prevent enteric hyperoxaluria. Oxalate can either stimulate or inhibit gut microbial diversity depending
on the baseline composition. Our preliminary work shows that when laboratory rodents with a reduced ODMN
are exposed to exogenous oxalate, urinary oxalate excretion gradually increases over time, there is a loss of
microbial diversity, and signs increased gut permeability are apparent. These effects are reversed in animals
with a robust ODMN. The by-products of oxalate metabolism are formate and CO2. Formate has known toxic
effects for both humans and bacteria. However, acetogenic, methanogenic, and sulfate-reducing bacteria
(AMS), which can use formate and CO2 as carbon and energy sources, are consistently present in the ODMN.
Thus, we propose oxalate-degrading and AMS bacteria exhibit metabolic interactions that synergistically
promote persistent colonization and reduce inflammation of host intestinal epithelium, thereby reducing oxalate
absorption. To test this hypothesis, we will Investigate the mechanistic microbe-microbe and host-microbe
interactions that modulate enteric hyperoxaluria, determine the role of AMS bacteria in preventing hyperoxaluria,
and investigate the mechanisms that drive the loss of ODMN function in a clinical cohort of patients."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly form of primary brain tumor in adults. One feature of
GBM that makes it exceedingly difficult to cure is its diffuse infiltration throughout the brain, as treatment,
including surgical resection of the primary tumor invariably results in recurrence, often remote from the site of
the original tumor. This clinical feature illustrates a key knowledge gap in GBM biology, as the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that drive the migration of tumor cells in the brain remain poorly defined. Recent
studies have shown that GBM progression is tightly linked to neuronal activity and our preliminary studies show
that increased neuronal activity stimulates migration of GBM cells towards hyperactive neurons in the
contralateral hemisphere. To decipher the molecular mechanisms driving activity-dependent, GBM infiltration,
we performed transcriptomic analysis of these tumors, finding enrichment of axon guidance genes and drastic
alterations in immune-related signatures. Functional studies with the axon guidance gene cohort revealed that
overexpression of EphA6, EphA7, or Sema4F in mouse GBM promoted infiltration of tumor cells and
decreased survival of tumor bearing mice. Similarly, we found decreased CD8-Tcells in response to activity-
driven infiltration and preliminary studies suggest that loss of these populations enhances malignant
progression.
 Based on the strength of these preliminary studies we propose three specific aims that seek to uncover
the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving GBM infiltration. In aim 1, we will manipulate the activity of
subsets of neurons in order to dissect which sub-types of neurons promote GBM infiltration. In aim2, we will
determine how EphA6, EphA7, and Sema4F contribute to GBM infiltration and pathophysiology. In aim3, we
will determine how neuronal activity influences immune responses, while determining how CD8 T-cells
contribute to GBM infiltration. Together, these aims will uncover which neuronal populations promote GBM
infiltration, while revealing new roles for axon guidance genes and chemokine receptors in tumor
pathophysiology."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide and results in a reduced quality of life due
to pain from common tasks such as walking or climbing and descending stairs. A particular challenge of OA is
detection of disease at an early and reversible stage before irreversible structural damage has occurred.
However, current imaging methods are performed in a static fashion and have limited sensitivity to joint function
or the tissue response to loading. There is a major need to evaluate the joint response from everyday loading
tasks, and how this response is altered in OA. Further, as age is a key risk factor of osteoarthritis, which
predominantly affects older adults, the role of aging in tissue changes and response to loading stress is of
particular interest.
PET-MRI offers simultaneous evaluation of multiple early markers of OA in all joint tissues. In particular, [18F]NaF
uptake can quantitatively evaluate bone metabolism, including bone perfusion and deposition of [18F] ions into
the bone matrix. Further, we have observed that joint loading acutely alters the bone physiology affecting
[18F]NaF uptake. This suggests that [18F]NaF uptake may be sensitive to increases in the metabolic response of
bone where there is breakdown of the whole-joint unit that results in focal increases in bone loading.
This project aims to develop a novel imaging “stress test”, based on [18F]NaF PET-MRI, that is able to evaluate
at a single time point, both the function of the whole-joint unit after physiological joint loading and multiple early
markers of OA. Our Specific Aims are to (1) develop a rapid, quantitative, dose- and time-minimized [18F]NaF
PET-MRI protocol to
evaluate joint function from a stair ascent/descent exercise “stress” test
; (2) evaluate
[18F]NaF PET-MRI imaging to detect and characterize differences in joint function associated with age and
between sexes; and (3) evaluate tissue response to loading stresses measured with PET-MRI in early OA and
whether abnormal response is predictive of OA disease progression.
The innovation of this project is the development of novel PET and MRI methods to assess the whole-joint
response to loading and evaluation of early degenerative disease changes affecting joint function and future OA
progression. The significance of this work is an imaging method that is able to rapidly assess joint function in
response to physiological loads, and evaluation of how this joint response evolves with age and between genders,
as well as the role of altered joint physiology in OA. This may allow us to detect early joint dysfunction at a single
time point, to not only study OA pathophysiology, risk factors, and phenotypes, but also to develop targeted
interventions."

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus
known to cause the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The disease has been declared as a
global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In the United States, as of January 20, 2021,
we have more than 24 million infected individuals with approximately 400,000 deaths. COVID-19
appears to be more deadly in patients with co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes and
presents many clinical manifestations such as pneumonia, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, etc.
among those infected. Moreover, the number of infections and fatality rate is expected to increase
significantly over the next few months, according to the IHME model. There is an urgent global
need to develop a thermostable and self-administrable vaccine. The spike protein on the surface
of coronavirus is an excellent candidate for developing vaccines, has been used in the currently
EUA obtained vaccines, as it plays an important role in the entry of the virus into the host cell.
Liposomes are excellent drug delivery systems that can present the antigen as particulate in
nature and allow the incorporation of an adjuvant that aids in the generation of a robust immune
response. Further, the liposomes can be designed to be of similar size to that of the virus and the
spike protein can be conjugated to the liposomal surface to mimic the natural presentation on the
virus. The immune cells will internalize and process the antigen like the virus and generate
neutralizing antibody titers. Most of the vaccines currently in the market require cold chain
(refrigeration) to store and distribute the vaccine to maintain the efficacy and require a visit to the
clinic for immunization by trained medical personnel. These serve as bottlenecks in achieving
mass vaccination in a pandemic adding further stress to the hospitals and the supply chain. In
addition, a major limitation is the limited ability of existing manufacturing facilities to manufacture
billions of doses. In this proposal, we aim to develop a thermostable and inhalable dry powder
vaccine that is easy to scale-up, eliminates the need for cold-chain storage and transport, and is
self-administrable by individuals’ at-home by simple inhalation. To achieve this goal, we will
pursue two aims: 1) Formulation of an inhalable and thermostable dry powder COVID-19 vaccine
containing S protein-adsorbed liposomal carriers and 2) Evaluation of neutralizing mucosal and
systemic IgA and IgG antibody titers after aerosol administration of dry powder COVID-19 vaccine
in mice. Successful completion of this project will have a profound impact on the development of
dry powder COVID-19 vaccine, particularly in exploring thermostable and inhalable vaccines that
are easy to manufacture, store, and distribute, characteristics that are critical in pandemic."

Premise and hypothesis: Ozone (O3) is a criteria air pollutant that increases the incidence of chronic
pulmonary diseases. The detrimental health effects upon O3 exposure occur in part through pulmonary
inflammation initiated by alveolar macrophage production of cytokine/chemokines. O3-induced inflammation
in the alveolar macrophage is driven by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), that increases NFB activation and
subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, targeting TLR4 driven signaling in
alveolar macrophages is a viable target to mitigate O3-induced pulmonary inflammation. In this
application, we focus on the role of diet in regulating alveolar macrophage TLR4-mediated
inflammatory responses upon O3 exposure. Specifically, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that is poorly consumed in the western diet, may protect against O3-
induced pulmonary inflammation. Based on strong preliminary data, we propose the central hypothesis
that DHA suppresses and resolves pulmonary inflammation through two distinct mechanisms: 1) Structurally,
we propose that DHA acyl chains of the plasma membrane remodel the size and composition of alveolar
macrophage lipid rafts to suppress downstream signaling and cytokine secretion; 2) Biochemically, DHA
undergoes enzymatic conversion into specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM), which are
highly potent immunoresolvants. As a consequence, DHA-derived SPMs decrease NFB activation
and the production of proinflammatory cyto/chemokines while promoting the clearance of apoptotic
cells termed ‘efferocytosis’. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data to show that DHA
decreases murine O3 induced pulmonary inflammation, augments levels of SPMs while increasing
expression of the SPM receptor ALX/FPR2, and remodels lipid raft size in vitro. Approach: To
define the structural and biochemical mechanisms of DHA, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we
will demonstrate that DHA improves O3-induced pulmonary inflammation and resolution of injury through
the use of DHA supplementation and a DHA-deficient mouse. In Aim 2, we will establish the mechanism
by which DHA remodels the biophysical structure of lipid rafts of alveolar macrophages to suppress
downstream signaling using cutting-edge quantitative imaging approaches. In Aim 3, we will establish
how DHA improves O3-induced pulmonary inflammation through the production of SPMs including the
use of an ALX/FPR knockout mouse. The proposed aims will innovatively merge inhalation
toxicology, nutritional biochemistry, membrane biophysics, and immunology. Impact:
Completion of this proposal will: 1) provide the scientific rationale for clinical DHA supplementation
studies mitigating O3-induced morbidity and; 2) provide key mechanistic links between
environmental pollutant exposure and diet that will inform targeted therapeutic strategies. Collectively, this
application is of high priority given that it sets the basis for long-term improved dietary
recommendations for susceptible populations in nonattainment air pollution areas to mitigate detrimental
health effects."

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease and is expected to become the second
leading cause of cancer-associated-death in the US by the year 2025. Targeted therapeutics have failed to
provide a significant survival advantage over the standard of care. With an intensified focus on immunotherapy,
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies alone have been insufficient for PDAC, which often displays a non-
immunogenic “cold” tumor phenotype that lacks cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration, thus incapable of
invoking an immune response. To this point, we have learned that multiple biological and molecular aspects of
PDAC contribute to ICB efficacy; including antigenicity, immunogenicity, and the tumor microenvironment.
Finding targeted therapeutics to increase these aspects of immunity and increase intratumoral T cell infiltration
are essential for improving immunotherapeutic applications for PDAC.
 Obesity is a prominent risk factor for development of PDAC as well as more advanced disease. Obesity
is well evidenced to drive local adipose inflammation, but also contributes to systemic inflammation. Our recent
findings indicate adipose derived cytokines directly modulate the transcriptional profile of PDAC cells.
Specifically, we found that stimulation of PDAC cells with adipose conditioned media promoted anti-immunogenic
chemokine secretion of tumor-derived CXCL5, which is a ligand of the CXCR1/2 receptors that typically regulates
myeloid recruitment and/or activation. While clinical trials targeting the CXCR1/2 receptors with pharmacologic
inhibitors have entered clinical trials, their efficacy in PDAC is questionable due to broad receptor expression
and conflicting results. In comparison, our studies have demonstrated that depleting tumor derived CXCL5, one
of many CXCR1/2 ligands, is sufficient to promote intratumoral CTL infiltration and prime the tumor for checkpoint
inhibition in the setting of obesity.
 In general, targeting pancreatic cancers with cell-specific biomarkers has presented a challenge to
researchers, as some biomarkers of PDAC are highly expressed in non-cancerous tissues and limiting drug
delivery to non-cancerous tissue is essential for minimizing side effects. The Plectin protein represents an ideal
biomarker for targeted therapeutic delivery. In healthy cells, Plectin maintains a cytoplasmic localization where
it is hidden from targeted therapeutics. Alternatively, Plectin is exclusively externalized in pancreatic cancer cells
where it provides an optimal target for drug delivery. Proof of principle studies have validated PDAC specific
binding of Plectin targeted AAV viral particles. We plan to package shRNA for CXCL5 into the Plectin-AAV
particles to recapitulate our CRISPR studies and induce susceptibility to ICB therapy in an obese setting."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, manifesting in brain
pathology, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. In general, confirmatory
diagnosis of AD involves both pathological hallmarks (such as plaques and tangles) as well
as clinically observed cognitive decline. Whereas most cases of patients with AD pathology
show cognitive and clinical phenotypes, a subset of individuals have pathology suggestive of
AD without the corresponding cognitive impairment. One possible explanation is that these
“resistant” individuals have compensatory mechanisms protecting their cognitive status from
the presence of pathology. Recent work from single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on post-
mortem human frontal cortex tissue suggests molecularly distinct subsets of astrocytes (a
non-neuronal cell type in the brain) are differentially present in “resistant” versus
“susceptible” (cognitively declined with pathology) individuals. However, this observation so
far has been limited to a single brain region in a small sample of primarily Caucasian
individuals. This proposal aims to corroborate and extend this finding by investigating
astrocyte subpopulations, their molecular profiles, and their associations with other cell types
in multiple regions of the brain in an ethnically diverse. Through a combination of single-
nucleus RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and systems
biology, we propose to create a map of the differential distribution of astrocyte
subpopulations in “resistant” and “susceptible” individuals, their spatial relation to pathology
and other cell types, and candidate genes and pathways that involved in astrocyte-mediated
resistance to tau pathology. Ultimately, characterizing the association between specific
astrocyte subpopulations, their interactions, and pathways involved in resistant individuals
may identify therapeutic avenues to mitigate cognitive decline in the presence of AD
pathology."

Over 15 million epilepsy patients worldwide have medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), i.e., they do not respond
to drugs [1]. Successful surgery is a hopeful alternative for seizure freedom but can only be achieved through
complete resection or disconnection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the brain region(s) where seizures originate.
Unfortunately, surgical success rates vary between 30%-70% because no clinically validated biological markers
of the EZ exist. Localizing the EZ has thus become a costly and time-consuming process during which a team
of clinicians obtain imaging data (e.g. MRI, PET) and scalp EEG recordings, which is often followed by invasive
monitoring involving days-to-weeks of EEG recordings captured intracranially (iEEG). Clinicians visually inspect
iEEG data, looking for abnormal activity (e.g. low-voltage high frequency activity) on individual channels
occurring immediately before seizures. They also look for abnormal iEEG spikes that last a few seconds
occurring in between seizures. In the end, clinicians use <1% of the iEEG data captured to assist in EZ
localization (minutes of seizure data versus days of recordings), which begs the question-“are we missing
significant opportunities to leverage these largely ignored data sets to better diagnose and treat patients?”
Intracranial EEG offers a unique opportunity to observe rich epileptic cortical network dynamics, which are only
visible by the naked eye during seizures. But, waiting for seizures to occur is risky for the patient as invasive
monitoring is associated with complications including bleedings, infections, and neurological deficits. Further,
the costs of monitoring are very high, with one estimate quoting that the cost is at least $5,000 per day. In the
proposed study, we aim to leverage iEEG data in between seizures by (ii) testing a new networked-based inter-
ictal (between seizure) iEEG marker of the EZ, and by (i) modulating seizure networks with single-pulse electrical
stimulation (SPES) and analyzing the associated cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). We hypothesize
that patient-specific dynamical network models (DNMs), built from each patient’s inter-ictal iEEG and CCEPs
data, can characterize brain network dynamics and reveal pathological nodes, i.e., the EZ. The DNM
characterizes how each iEEG node (channel) dynamically influences the rest of the network and how the network
responds to exogenous stimuli. Our team has expertise in dynamical systems modeling, signal processing of
iEEG data, electrophysiology, and surgical treatment of epilepsy, and is uniquely positioned to test our main
hypothesis through the following aims: (i) to investigate source-sink properties of DNMs derived from interictal
iEEG data to localize the EZ, (ii) to investigate resonance properties of DNMs derived from SPES evoked
responses to localize the EZ, and (iii) to test whether stimulating suspected EZ nodes with resonant periodic
pulse inputs triggers seizures. If successful, the proposed computational approaches and SPES experiments
have the potential to significantly reduce invasive monitoring times, avoiding further risks to patients and reducing
costs to hospitals by leveraging access to patient iEEG networks during passive monitoring."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality for both men and women in the United States. The
number of new cases of lung cancer exceeds 220,000 yearly; with an appalling five year survival of 16% for
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall goal of the proposed research is to decrease suffering and
improve survival for NSCLCs harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1) or ERBB2 mutations
(i.e., >20% of all NSCLCs; the most common cause of cancer death worldwide). EGFR mutated NSCLCs
comprise diseases with a distinct biology marked predominantly by targetable mutations involving inframe
indels in exon 19 and the point mutation L858R. Some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can effectively inhibit
signaling from these aberrant kinases, disrupt their downstream signaling cascades and induce apoptosis.
TKIs are now clinically available (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib and osimertinib) or in development as palliative
therapies for advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC. However, the third most prevalent group of EGFR mutations in
NSCLC (>10% of cases) is composed of inframe insertions (of 1-4 amino-acids spanning residues E762 to
C775) within exon 20 of EGFR that are insensitive to approved EGFR TKIs. Therefore, the identification of
therapies that can or not abrogate kinase activity for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated NSCLCs are essential to
understand the promises plus limitations of precisions therapies for this cohort of tumors. The close homology
of EGFR and ErbB2 insertion mutations highlights that future therapeutic options for EGFR exon 20 insertion
mutations will be applicable to other cohorts of NSCLC. The proposal will take advantage of our budding
comprehensive models to completely characterize EGFR exon 20 mutants and identify novel therapies for this
genomic subgroup of tumors. Aim 1 will establish robust preclinical models to represent EGFR exon 20
insertion mutations as a homogenous group; with a goal of generating novel models that are necessary to
evaluate therapies against these NSCLCs. Aim 2 will evaluate available and novel therapies against EGFR
exon 20 mutants; with a goal of identifying effective therapies - including EGFR/ERBB2 exon 20 mutant
specific TKIs – and their putative mechanisms of resistance. Aim 3 will support the clinical development of an
EGFR/ERBB2 exon 20 mutant specific TKI; with a goal of confirming the clinical efficacy of such a class of
drugs and designing rational combination therapies to prevent the development of acquired resistance. The
final translational goals of these models are to provide rational concepts that can be explored initially in
confirmatory clinical trials and subsequently in the clinical care of patients. If these goals are met, quality of life
and survival of patients will be extended beyond what is currently available."

Environmental exposures and lifestyle choices can result in cellular oxidative stress,
characterized by the generation of an abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS wreak
havoc on the structure of DNA bases, with guanine modification yielding the lesion 8-oxo-7,8-
dihydroguanine (8oxoG) being particularly prevalent. If not repaired, 8oxoG is mutagenic, causing
G to T transversion mutations that can initiate and promote human disease. Guanine-rich G-
quadruplex (G4) forming sequences are enriched at promoter proximal regions of the genome,
making these regions hot spots for 8oxoG lesions. The repair of 8oxoG by the base excision repair
(BER) pathway on G4 promoter sequences (i.e., VEGF) can modulate transcription, however the
molecular level interactions and mechanistic details of the repair activity within the G4 promoter
context are not well understood. The overall goal of the proposed research is to characterize the
molecular level interactions and coordination events coupling the repair of 8oxoG and gene
enhancement at the VEGF promoter in response to oxidative stress. The experiments proposed
to address this will be conducted in two phases. During the initial mentored K99 phase, X-ray
crystallography, advanced nucleic acid kinetics, single-molecule fluorescence, and a human cell-
based transcription assays will be utilized to characterize the activities of APE1 and Polβ on the
VEGF G4 promoter (Aim 1). While in the mentored phase, the candidate will also take advantage
of the resources available at University of Kansas Medical Center for professional development
and will continuously apply these skills through structured teaching, mentoring, data presentation,
and writing opportunities. During the non-mentored phase (R00) of the project, technical skills the
candidate has gained will be used to elucidate a model for the recruitment of transcription factors
to the VEGF G4 promoter sequence (Aim 2). Also, during the R00 phase the candidate will extend
these approaches to interrogate how BER is completed on the unique G4 substrate and elucidate
the extent of coupling between repair and transcription (Aim 3). These experiments will provide
the candidate with the data required for an early independent publication and preliminary data for
R-series grants. Importantly, during the R00 phase the candidate will develop independence from
their mentor by focusing on the interplay between DNA repair and transcription regulation and
shifting their work to study the epigenetic-like role of oxidative DNA lesions as transcription
modulators through DNA repair."
10795004,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kidney transplantation and home dialysis are the preferred treatment modalities for end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD) given the better quality of life and lower cost of these modalities compared with in-center hemodialysis.
However, in patients with graft failure, rates of preemptive re-listing for a second kidney transplant and use of
peritoneal dialysis (PD) are suboptimal, especially in Black and Hispanic kidney transplant recipients (KTRs).
While barriers in access to transplantation or PD in transplant-naïve patients have been attributed to lack of
patient awareness of their kidney disease, late referral for subspecialty care, and inadequate education, these
factors should not apply to a population that already received a kidney transplant, were likely exposed to
dialysis before their first transplant, and who have access to nephrology care. Disappointingly, only half of
KTRs treated with PD before their kidney transplant choose to return to this modality following graft failure, and
only 15% of patients with graft failure are relisted preemptively for a second kidney transplant. The rate of PD
use and relisting is particularly low in Black and Hispanic KTRs with graft failure. Identifying barriers that can
be addressed to improve access of former KTRs to home dialysis and repeat transplantation will not only
improve the outcomes of patients with graft failure, but also inform our understanding of the roadblocks that are
present even when access to care is unlikely to be the explanatory factor. In Aim 1, we propose to model the
time spent in the advanced stages of graft dysfunction and determine whether there are racial or ethnic
disparities in this time, which is critical for the preparation of patients for the next phase of their disease. We
will then determine if the time spent in the advanced stages of graft dysfunction is associated with access to
PD or re-registration on the waitlist for a second kidney transplant. In Aim 2, we will perform semi-structured
interviews with patients, dialysis providers, and transplant providers to understand their perceptions of the
barriers to PD and preemptive relisting. We will then use the data derived from these qualitative interviews to
develop a survey that will be administered nationally to confirm the importance of these barriers and identify
strategies that can be used to surmount these barriers. In Aim 3, we will examine system-level factors that
may contribute to disparities in preemptive relisting on the national waitlist and PD access, including variations
in the use of objective assessments of frailty during candidacy evaluations and the frequency of follow-up
contact between KTRs and their transplant center peri-graft failure. To accomplish our aims, we will leverage
data from the United States Renal Data System that will be linked to Medicare, Medicaid, and Optum claims
data. In a subset of patients, we will collect more granular local data from electronic health record systems to
enrich these administrative data. The data from this proposal will inform the interventions, best practices, and
policies that are needed to promote access to repeat transplantation and PD."

There are a myriad of new HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug formulations and delivery modalities
under clinical development, and it is expected that a range of biomedical HIV prevention options will soon be
available. To enable these options to have maximum public health impact there is an urgent need to create
biobehavioral infrastructure (i.e., empirically validated knowledge, guidelines, and tools) that will: a) allow the
integration of these new options into existing PrEP delivery systems; b) support adherence and retention in an
emerging HIV prevention service system; and c) promote health equity by ensuring that new prevention
options expand HIV prevention coverage to highest priority populations. However, limited research exists that
integrates lessons from existing implementation efforts for oral PrEP and develops data-driven tools that can
be used by research and clinical practice to accelerate diffusion of proven prevention strategies. In response to
that need, the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Synthesize intervention components of PrEP service
delivery models in seven federally designated Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE) hotspot counties across the
US, representing diverse geographical contexts, patient populations, and delivery settings; (2) Operationalize
a set of PrEP service delivery process and outcome metrics than can be used to assess fidelity to service
delivery models for daily oral PrEP and emerging modalities and measure progress toward enhancing
biomedical prevention uptake, persistence, and equitable coverage; and (3) Define universal and modality-
specific pre-implementation and implementation activities necessary for settings to integrate emerging
prevention options into clinical practice. This project builds on the past work of the investigative team in oral
PrEP demonstration and implementation projects, development/testing of novel prevention modalities, and
dissemination of evidence-based implementation tools for clinical practice. To accomplish our aims, we will
apply two seminal theoretical models from the implementation science literature, and collaborate with seven
clinical partners in seven EtHE hotspots across the US, as well as a CDC-funded Capacity Building Assistance
(CBA) provider who delivers PrEP training and technical assistance to sites across the country. The knowledge
generated by this project will not only advance the field of implementation science, but also create tangible
tools that can help clinics, heath systems, and policy decision makers improve PrEP implementation outcomes
at a population level. This project has the potential to make a significant and sustained impact on the quality of
future implementation efforts, and the speed with which new modalities are effectively disseminated to highest
priority populations."

The University of Michigan (UM), inclusive of its Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMCCC) and
Medical School Departments, requests this UG1 award as an NCI National Clinical Trials
Network Lead Academic Participating Site (NCTN LAPS-UG1). We view this opportunity as an
important component of a large cancer research effort at our institution. We remain committed
to the concept that multi-institutional collaboration is essential to the advancement of cancer
treatment. Our goal as a LAPS site is to make significant scientific, leadership, administrative
and patient data contributions to the NCTN effort to study and improve cancer therapy. The
NCTN process involves the development and conduct of purposeful clinical trials, adoption of
uniform toxicity and response criteria, collection of patient data, and results reporting. NCTN
Group research is the only setting in which sophisticated concepts of combined modality and
interdisciplinary therapy as well as adjuvant therapies can be properly evaluated. NCTN clinical
research has also provided an improved understanding of the important relationships between
prognostic factors, therapy and patient outcomes that could not have been obtained otherwise."

The Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is one of the most complex joints in the human body, with high prevalence
of diseases and trauma. 75% of the injured TMJ condyles in children can regenerate without surgery by an
unknown mechanism, whereas some patients develop ankylosis, leading to restricted mouth opening and
facial aesthetic defects. TMJ is composed of the mandibular condyle, temporal bone, and a disc with abundant
tendon attachments. Tendon has been thought to play the sole function of transmitting muscle forces to
stabilize joints, yet it is largely unclear why tendon undergoes ectopic ossification in trauma or diseases, and
whether it has any direct contribution to skeletal formation. To investigate the full biological significance of
tendon in TMJ postnatal growth and expansion, a series of in vivo experiments were performed. The key
findings are a. the TMJ condyle is composed of a well-established cartilage head and an overlooked bony head
that grows after birth and continuously expands during lifespan; b. the tendon-attached bony head, ramus, and
temporal bone share unique features in mineral pattern, cell morphology, and ECM (extracellular matrix)
profiles, which are distinct from conventional bone (such as periosteum-formed bone, PFB); c. this newly
identified bone tissue (named tendon-formed bone, TFB) originates from Scx+ (scleraxis) tendon cells via an
interface, and invades the adjacent cartilage or bone to form a tight connection beyond a simple attachment
between tendon and bone; d. Hypophosphatemia accelerates cell proliferation and transdifferentiation of the
avascular tendon to TFB, resulting in a malformed TMJ; and e. mature Scx+ tendon cells rapidly and robustly
switch their fate to cartilage and bone cells upon TMJ trauma, giving rise to a self-repair or ankylosis. These
novel findings raise the following central hypothesis: tendon cells, beyond their conventional role in joint
movement, are responsible for the postnatal growth and expansion of TMJ condyle head, ramus, and temporal
bone, as well as a key player during TMJ trauma repair and ankylosis onset. To test this hypothesis, two highly
related, yet independent Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To define novel roles of tendon in forming bone cells of
the bony condyle head and ramus, which are distinct from conventional bone in cell morphology, ECM
components, and mineralization; 2) To define novel roles of tendon during TMJ temporal bone growth, as well
as the plasticity of adult tendon cells that are responsible for trauma-induced TMJ ankylosis. Upon completion of
the proposed work, it is expected to demonstrate that a) Scx+ tendon cells directly contribute to the postnatal
growth and expansion of TMJ bony head, ramus, and temporal bone through a cell transdifferentiation
mechanism; and b) adult tendon cells participate in TMJ repair and ankylosis onset upon trauma by shifting
their cell fate to chondrocytes and bone cells. Findings from this study will fill knowledge gaps in this largely
unknown but vital area, revise the current dogma by raising a new type of tendon-derived bone, and lay the
foundation for developing novel approaches to the restoration of TMJ in trauma and disease."
10795651,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) results from insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose
production, and impaired islet function which is likely a key determinant of whether T2D
develops. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for islet dysfunction are
incompletely defined and largely unknown. To address these challenges, we submit this
application in response to FOA-DK-18-016, Human Pancreas Analysis Program for Type-2
Diabetes (HPAP-T2D). Our collaborative and interdisciplinary team will interrogate T2D human
pancreatic tissue and islets from clinically phenotyped or “staged” donors using the range of
experimental approaches outlined in the RFA and new experimental techniques. Our team will:
(1) Collect and process the pancreas and islets from individuals with; (a) prediabetes, (b) T2D
diabetes treated with only diet and/or oral medications, (c) T2D diabetes treated with insulin,
and (d) from normal controls, and determine their genetic risk for T2D; (2) Use the broad range
of molecular techniques requested by the RFA and integration with new and emerging
experimental approaches to comprehensively phenotype the pancreatic islets isolated from
designated donor groups to understand molecular changes in T2D; (3) Use state-of-the-art
approaches coupled with new cutting-edge multiplexing technology, to comprehensively analyze
pancreatic tissue architecture in cellular and extracellular compartments from designated donor
groups; (4) Integrate data from these studies into the comprehensive, open-access, searchable
PANC-DB database, and help develop this resource to serve the community of scientists
interested in understanding human pancreatic and islet biology in T2D; (5) Create, enhance,
and leverage partnerships with complementary programs like HPAP-T1D, HIRN, IIDP, nPOD,
AMP-T2D, and QUOD. Our group of investigators has been collaborating extensively on studies
of the human pancreas and islets, including T2D pancreatic organs with associated clinical
information as called for in this RFA. We are committed to harmonization, integration, and co-
registration of data from the different approaches with the ultimate output of our efforts being a
comprehensive T2D profile available to all investigators interested in T2D through PANC-DB.
Thus, the successful formation of our proposed program should lead to improved understanding
of the T2D pathogenesis as well as the design of therapies capable of preventing and/or
reversing the disorder."

Nausea is an unpleasant sensation of visceral malaise, with underlying molecular and neuronal pathways
remaining mysterious. Current anti-nausea medications display variable success across patient cohorts, with
nausea being the major reason why cancer patients cannot adhere to treatment regimens. New strategies for
nausea intervention are needed, and may be enabled by a mechanistic understanding of how the sensation of
nausea arises. Classical studies involving brain lesion and stimulation revealed a tiny brain structure termed
the area postrema that mediates nausea responses to several visceral threats. The area postrema is a
circumventricular organ containing brain-resident sensory neurons that are anatomically poised to receive
inputs from both circulating factors and vagal afferents. However, the diversity of area postrema cell types and
receptors was previously uncharted.
In preliminary data, we built an area postrema cell atlas through single-nucleus RNA sequencing, revealing
four excitatory and three inhibitory neuron types. Transcriptome analysis revealed signature genes expressed
in different neuronal clusters, as well as many cell surface receptors that guide cellular responses. We
generated Cre knock-in mice for genetic access to various area postrema neurons, and adapted approaches
for cell-specific chemogenetics, optogenetics, ablation, imaging, and anatomical mapping. We found two
excitatory neuron types (clusters 2 and 4) that provide powerful aversion teaching signals, and one (cluster 1)
that does not. In Aim 1, we will use genetic tools to ask whether cell clusters 2 and 4, and the receptors they
express, mediate behavioral responses to a panel of nausea-inducing stimuli. In Aim 2, we will measure the
responses of cell clusters 2 and 4 to humoral factors, genetically defined vagal afferents, and various nausea-
inducing stimuli. In Aim 3 we will investigate the roles of newly charted inhibitory neurons in the area postrema,
which project locally and are excellent candidates to suppress nausea or other area postrema-mediated
behaviors. Together, these experiments will reveal the basic organization of area postrema circuitry, and
provide a framework towards understanding and therapeutically controlling nausea."

Our laboratory has been focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate progressive
pulmonary fibrosis for over two decades. My contributions to the field of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis research
include using matrix hyaluronan as a model molecule to dissect the molecular mechanisms of progressive lung
fibrosis. We have identified the role of hyaluronan fragments in regulating lung inflammation. We discovered
that hyaluronan and hyaluronan receptors have roles in lung inflammation and in lung stem cell regeneration.
We discovered an invasive fibroblast phenotype in mice as well as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis explants.
We are generally credited with expanding the notion that matrix is more than just glue and has a dynamic role
in regulating lung biology. One aspect of our work that I have been proud of is that we have published much of
our science in non-subspecialty journals of reasonable impact. This suggests that although we study the lung,
the concepts we have put forward have been deemed of interest to a broader audience. The goals of this R35
application are to identify the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that lead to unremitting fibrosis. Specifically,
we propose in this R35 to identify mechanisms for AEC2 failed regenerative capacity in mouse and man, to
identify mechanisms for mesenchymal expansion in mice with impaired AEC2 renewal capacity, to identify the
mechanisms by which beta-arrestin1 and CD44 regulate the invasive fibroblast phenotype, and to identify
mechanisms by which the invasive fibroblast impairs AEC2 cell renewal. Augmenting scientific knowledge in
understanding the underlying mechanisms and the mode of actions of these interactions in lung fibrosis could
significantly aid therapeutic development for patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis. My belief is that we
need a drug that promotes alveolar progenitor cells renewal and a drug that targets pathogenic fibroblasts such
as invasive fibroblasts. The studies that we propose in this R35 application may suggest new leads for
therapeutic intervention we are not yet aware of and we want to have the freedom to pursue them.
Furthermore, the benefit of longer-term funding of this award allows me to train the next generation of
scientists as I have done during my time at Duke University as well as currently here at Cedars."
10795896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Deletions of all or part of chromosome 7 [-7/del(7q)] are among the most common karyotypic
abnormalities in myeloid diseases, particularly high-risk myeloid diseases. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is
a series of clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, leading to peripheral cytopenias and
dysplasia in one or more blood lineages with risk of transformation to acute leukemia. -7/del(7q) is found in 10%
of adult MDS cases and, strikingly, in up to 50% of pediatric MDS cases. The presence of -7/del(7q) is associated
with a poor karyotype and higher risk MDS, and carries a worse prognosis than cases with diploid chromosome
7. -7/del(7q) is often the only cytogenetic finding, and in a subset of pediatric MDS cases is the sole detectable
molecular abnormality, strongly suggesting a driving role for chromosome 7 deletions in disease pathogenesis.
There have been no new therapies for MDS in over a decade, highlighting an urgent need to better understand
the recurrent genetic features of MDS that may lead to new treatment options.
 The lack of synteny between human and mouse chromosome 7 is a major barrier in the development of
animal models of -7/del(7q). In a breakthrough in the field, our lab identified CUX1, a homeobox transcription
factor shown to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, as a haploinsufficient myeloid tumor suppressor gene
located in a commonly deleted region of 7q. Our lab engineered a doxycycline-inducible shRNA CUX1-
knockdown mouse, and mice deficient in Cux1 develop a myeloid disease with trilineage dysplasia and lethal
anemia, hallmarks of MDS. These data strongly support a role for this 7q-encoded gene in MDS etiology.
However, chromosome 7 deletions are often large and span additional genes that alter hematopoiesis or lead to
myeloid disease when deleted in mouse models. These data suggest 7q may be a contiguous gene syndrome
region, in which loss of multiple neighboring genes en bloc contributes to disease development. Our preliminary
data show CUX1 loss in human K562 leukemia cells decreases the repressive epigenetic histone mark
H3K27me3. We further show that combined loss of Cux1 and the 7q gene Ezh2, an H3K27 methyltransferase,
in murine hematopoietic progenitors synergistically increases myeloid cell expansion in vitro, compared to either
gene alone. These data provide support for the hypothesis that 7q is a contiguous gene syndrome region. This
proposal aims to: 1) leverage CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to identify combinatorial 7q gene deletions that
cooperate with Cux1 loss to drive del(7q) pathogenesis; and 2) define mechanisms by which loss of 7q genes
drives del(7q) pathogenesis by characterizing the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of cells deficient in
Cux1 alone or with combined Ezh2 loss. This proposal will advance our understanding of chromosome 7
deletions and provide me with a specialized skill set in myeloid neoplasia and genomics that will propel me
toward a career as an independent investigator."
10795902,"Project Summary: The objective of this proposal is to define the role of damaged RNA in mediating
signaling events during cancer chemotherapy. In the previous funding cycle of this grant, we uncovered a novel
ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway initiated specifically when cells encounter alkylating agents, one of the
most commonly used systemic modalities for cancer treatment. This pathway depends on the RNF113A E3
ubiquitin ligase, which in turn recruits the ASCC DNA helicase complex as well as the ALKBH3
demethylase/dealkylase. To date, most of the studies on alkylation damage, including our own work, has focused
on how alkylated lesions are recognized and repaired on DNA. Yet, damage to RNA is far more abundant than
damaged DNA in any cell which encounters an alkylating agent. Using novel tools to induce or repair alkylated
RNA, we have found that alkylated RNA is necessary and sufficient to activate the E3 ligase function of RNF113A
and recruit the ASCC complex. Our evidence also indicates that RNF113A is a phospho-activated E3 ligase,
and that the CDK12 kinase is responsible for its phosphorylation. This data serves as the basis for our model
that RNA alkylation functions upstream of a kinase (CDK12) that activates an E3 ligase (RNF113A), which in
turn recruits an alkylation repair complex (ASCC-ALKBH3). In this proposal, we will seek to understand the
mechanistic basis for how RNA alkylation recapitulates the activation of the RNF113A-ASCC-ALKBH3 pathway
(Aim 1). We will characterize the role of this pathway in removing damaged RNAs, preventing replication-
transcription conflicts and RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine the functional
consequences of CDK12-mediated phosphorylation in the activation of RNF113A and its role in tumor
chemotherapy responses (Aim 3). Notably, since small molecule CDK12 inhibitors are already available, we will
be able to test whether targeting this pathway will improve alkylation therapy responses. Together, our work will
establish a new paradigm in nucleic acid damage signaling, where RNA damage plays a central role in mediating
DNA repair."
10795904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed research addresses a key patient safety gap among children with medical complexity (CMC)
transitioning between hospital and home—medication related harm. CMC are often on multiple and complex
medication regimens and have intensive healthcare needs. As a result, they experience frequent transitions of
care, across professional roles and care settings and during these transitions, CMC are at great risk for
medication-related harm. Most transitional care interventions have been adopted from adult care settings and
may not be adequate to address the unique needs of CMC and their family caregivers. Interventions that are
grounded in the unique situations and complexities of such patients are needed to improve medication use
safety and family experience of care.
This proposal describes the PI’s plan to transition into an independent investigator by developing expertise in
1) participatory, human centered design to co-develop useful interventions, and 2) implementing and
evaluating interventions. The proposal also describes a 4-year project for developing a prototype care
transition medication safety intervention and generating early evidence on its usability and potential factors
influencing its future implementation.
Aim 1: Patient journey mapping—will be used to elucidate medication safety risks and contexts during the
hospital-to-home transition period. Journey maps will be used to capture and visually represent the medication
use experience of families across professional settings and boundaries. The output of this aim will inform
prototype design under Aim 2.
Aim 2: Participatory, human centered design to co-design a prototype medication safety intervention. Through
multiple, iterative co-design sessions involving healthcare workers and family caregivers, a team will design a
prototype medication safety intervention informed by journey maps from Aim 1, current literature, and
participant elicitations. The result will be a composite prototype ready for usability testing.
Aim 3: Will test usability of prototype intervention with healthcare workers and family caregivers. Additionally,
barriers and facilitators that may be anticipated during future prototype implementation will be explored. Taken
together, all 3 aims will yield a final, refined prototype intervention designed to improve medication use safety
during care transitions.
Future work will include a randomized controlled trial of the prototype medication safety intervention to
formally evaluate it effectiveness in preventing or reducing medication related harm as well as improving the
medication use experience of CMC and their family caregivers."

The US is facing rising suicide rates. Yet, we have only a limited understanding of why some people, but not
others, progress from contemplating to attempting suicide. In the past funding period, we have shown that
depressed older adults whose decision-making is impaired are more likely to progress from suicidal ideation to
action. Specifically, using decision experiments, computational modeling, and fMRI, we have found replicable
deficits in learning and choice processes paralleled by altered ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal abstract
learning signals. In this renewal application, we propose to extend these findings by examining how people at
risk for suicide make decisions under cognitive and emotional demands that are more representative of the
suicidal crisis. In our computational framework these demands include (i) a high information load and (ii)
constraints on information processing imposed by time pressure and impending threats. We have developed
and validated new experimental and computational methods for studying information-processing bottlenecks
during decision-making. Specifically, our reinforcement learning computational model applied to behavioral and
neuroimaging data, enables us to examine how people use their limited neurocomputational resources to make
good decisions under high information load. Our preliminary studies show that decision-making in this context
(i) relies on resource-rational strategies for managing information load, (ii) is subserved by dorsal attention and
cingulo-opercular networks, (iii) is likely disrupted in attempted suicide, (iv) a deficit paralleled by abnormal
dorsal attention network responses to information load. We thus propose to test the general hypothesis that
people at risk for suicide are prone to information-processing bottlenecks arising from alterations in these
cortical networks. We will perform decision experiments and cognitive computational models (Aim 1) in a
discovery sample and a non-overlapping replication sample (n = 200 each) to ensure that findings are robust to
the clinical and cognitive heterogeneity of suicidal behavior. Both samples will include individuals maximally
representative of suicide victims, namely older depressed suicide attempters, about half of whom survived
near-lethal attempts. Functional neuroimaging experiments manipulating information load will interrogate the
neurocomputational dynamics of the dorsal attention network and cingulo-opercular network during decision-
making in one sample (n = 200, Aim 2). A careful characterization of psychopathology, personality, cognition,
psychotropic exposure and brain damage from suicide attempts will allow us to control for key confounds. The
interdisciplinary team has expertise in mechanisms of suicidal behavior (Dombrovski), decision neuroscience
(Dombrovski, McGuire, Hallquist), imaging methods (Hallquist), and suicide risk management (Szanto,
Dombrovski). This work aligns with a key objective of the NIMH’s prioritized research agenda on suicide: “to
identify cognitive dysfunction/neural circuitry profiles … associated with suicide risk” and taps into the
reinforcement learning and limited capacity constructs of the RDoC framework."

expressing 41BB ligand (41BBL), and have demonstrated improved antitumor activity compared to standard B7-
H3-CAR T cells in preclinical models. We now wish to evaluate our approach clinically and hypothesize that
the administration of B7-H3-CAR T cells is safe and results in antitumor effects. Secondary hypotheses
include that carefully orchestrated correlative studies are needed to decipher human CAR T cell biology
and improve their potency. These hypotheses will be evaluated in two interrelated research aims. Aim 1 is
focused on translation, implementing a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and antitumor activity of B7-
H3-CAR T cells expressing 41BBL for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B7-H3-positive solid tumors.
Aim 2 is focused on reverse translation, assessing the in vivo expansion and persistence of B7-H3-CAR T cells.
It will perform single cell (sc) TCR analysis, 10x scRNAseq analysis and whole genome bisulfite sequencing
(WGBS) to determine the clonal structure and functional state of B7-H3-CAR T cells. Tumors will also be biopsied
to determine B7-H3-CAR T cell presence and interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Based on results
of these correlative studies, we will implement one strategy to improve the effector function/antitumor activity of
B7-H3-CAR T cells and evaluate it in preclinical models. Successful completion of the proposed studies in this
R01 application will provide critical information for the field of cell therapy for solid tumors. While this application
is focused on targeting B7-H3-positive pediatric solid tumors, our findings could be readily applied to other B7-
H3-positive pediatric and adult tumors, and CAR T cell therapies targeting different tumor associated antigens."

Clark Atlanta University (CAU) is a comprehensive institution of higher education with a distinct Black-American
heritage, and federally accredited as a historically black college/university (HBCU) by the US. Department of
Education. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established at CAU
in 1999 with support from the NIH/RCMI program focused on research in cancer biology, drug discovery and
social/behavioral aspects of cancer. In 2004, CAU focused the research program on prostate cancer and its
impact in the African-American community. In 2005, the Center was designated as CAU’s 1st university-wide
Center of Excellence with the following objectives: A) Develop a group of internationally known scientists that
will execute high-impact basic research in cancer, and contribute in the development of successful therapeutic,
community and translational strategies for cancer; B) Train undergraduate and graduate students, and
postdoctoral fellows in cancer research, and, hence, develop and produce future generations of African-
American scientists of the highest caliber; and C) Establish educational programming to increase awareness for
prevention, early detection and treatment of cancers, especially those which disproportionately affect the African-
American community. As a consequence of targeted recruitment of faculty and staff over the past 19 years,
CCRTD is currently one of the largest centers of its kind in the nation with a unique and comprehensive program
whole dedicated to prostate cancer. We’ve recruited 9 external tenure-track faculty members to CAU with diverse
expertise in biomedical sciences, and have expanded our social/behavioral faculty with 3 faculty from Social
Work (2) and Public Administration (1). To provide state-of-the art research infrastructure, the CCRTD has
developed research core laboratories to support research activities of faculty, staff and students which have
undergone significant expansion throughout the past several years. We are also actively engaged in the research
training and education of both undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, our community education and
outreach unit has established dynamic educational and outreach programs for African-American men, their
families and caretakers, and community-at-large in Southwest City of Atlanta and beyond. The current proposal
seeks to expand and enhance the research agenda and community engagement activities at CCRTD through
(1)transitioning the basic science research to early and beginning translational outcomes, expanding our
research agenda in social/behavior sciences, recruiting faculty in health disparities research, and developing
robust projects in biomedical or social/behavioral research of prostate cancer activities for junior scientists;
(2)acquire new equipment to upgrade the current research core laboratories, renovate space to house new
equipment and current equipment, and renovate data architecture to accommodate new equipment, and data
needs; and (3) improving community engagement to achieve sustainable outcomes, equitable decision-making
processes, and deepen relationships and trust between the community and the CCRTD."
10796057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The majority of children on the autism spectrum have a co-occurring mental health disorder and emotion
dysregulation is posited to serve as a risk factor for the development of mental health disorders. However,
regulating emotions is a dynamic process that is influenced by the interplay of child characteristics and the
family context and there is a paucity of research examining these processes in children on the autism
spectrum. The long-term goal is to reduce the co-occurrence of mental health disorders in children on the
autism spectrum. The overall objective in this application is to clarify the associations between the family
context and children’s development of emotion regulation. The central hypothesis is that the strength and
direction of the associations between the family context and emotion regulation depend upon children’s
characteristics, including autism diagnostic status and the heterogeneity of autism symptom severity. The
rationale for the proposed research is that once we identify contextual factors associated with emotion
regulation, and for whom they are applicable to, then we can develop appropriate interventions to reduce the
development of co-occurring mental health disorders. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) Identify whether dynamics of emotion regulation differ for children on the autism spectrum
compared to non-ASD children and whether, among children on the autism spectrum, such dynamics vary as a
function of child characteristics; and 2) Identify the extent to which aspects of the family context, previously
identified in NT children, are associated with emotion regulation and whether child characteristics moderate
these associations. The PI’s preliminary studies indicate strong feasibility of recruiting a sample of young
children on the autism spectrum and measuring emotion regulation. The proposed research will include 220
children (110 ASD; 110 non-ASD) and their parents. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant’s
opinion, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by using a multi-method design to
understanding the dynamics of emotion regulation in children on the autism spectrum and identifying which
children are most at risk for difficulties regulating emotions. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to inform efforts to promote healthy emotional development in children on the autism spectrum."

 We propose to use third generation, long-read sequencing (LRS) to resolve inconclusive diagnoses and
maximize the diagnostic yield in patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. The diagnostic yield of whole
exome and genome sequencing stands at 40-50% including a significant proportion of patients receiving an
inconclusive diagnosis. The limitations of the current short-read technologies can be attributed to the negative
and inconclusive molecular diagnoses that prevent us from maximizing the diagnostic yield. Also, the vast
majority of the patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey due to the practice of sequential testing paradigm.
In the proposed study, we will perform LRS in a cohort of patients with heterogenous pediatric disorders to
resolve a) inconclusive diagnoses in patients with a single disease associated variant in an autosomal
recessive disorder gene, and two disease associated variants in the same gene with unknown phase, and b)
variants of uncertain significance or variant of unknown parent-of-origin in patients with epigenetic or imprinting
disorder. We will determine the diagnostic utility of LRS and its impact on uncertainty in diagnoses against the
current standard of care exome/ genome sequencing. We will build upon the existing resources of our clinical
lab and our own cutting-edge genomic and bioinformatic capabilities. We anticipate that our studies will
contribute new knowledge about the increased diagnostic yield from resolution of inconclusive diagnoses and
lead to the faster adoption of long-reads in clinical settings."

Episodic migraine (EM) sufferers can develop a progressive state of their disease with more than 15
attacks per month. This state is referred to as chronic migraine (CM), a disorder that significantly impacts
a patient’s daily life with more frequent sensory and emotional suffering and potential for substance abuse,
especially opiates. Built on rigorous scientific data from our initial R01 on EM, our next goal is to expand
the investigation and modulation of endogenous µ-opioid neurotransmission to more complex CM patients.
We will investigate how this µ-opioid dysfunction impacts other crucial central neurotransmitters (D2/D3
dopamine) and systems (sensory and reward), leading to a worsening of pain/emotional suffering. The
endogenous μ-opioid and D2/D3 dopamine are arguably two of the most crucial molecular mechanisms
responsible for pain and emotional regulation; they are the primary targets for the action of the most potent
exogenous analgesic and psychotic drugs available. Our initial EM study using PET with [11C] carfentanil,
a selective μ-opioid receptor (μOR) radiotracer, has demonstrated a decrease in μOR availability (non-
displaceable binding potential [BPND]) in the brains of EM patients during attacks. Notably, our preliminary
data shows that with the progression to CM, there is a further increase in μ-opioid (peptide) release in the
amygdala that correlates with attack severity and allodynia. The EM attacks were also accompanied by
an increase in DA D2/D3 BPND measured by [11C]raclopride in the basal ganglia, and the longer the
history and recurrence of attacks, the lower the ictal endogenous DA release. We were the first group to
demonstrate that a non-invasive neuromodulatory method targeting the primary motor cortex (M1),
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can immediately modulate the µOR system. We further
developed a M1 high-definition tDCS montage (M11 HD-tDCS) that significantly reversed μOR BPND in
more frequent EM patients and reduced CM-specific clinical endpoints (e.g., moderate/severe days per
month). Built on solid and persuasive data from our prior R01 in EM, our renewal project expands its
relevance by directly evaluating and modulating crucial neurotransmitters, systems/symptoms associated
with pain suffering in the most resilient migraine, CM: Aim1. Demonstrate with PET that patients who
progress to CM display higher dysfunction than EM in endogenous μ-opioid and D2/D3 dopamine
neurotransmission that correlates with their attack frequency and severe pain suffering; Aim2. Evaluate
the impact of CM on the neuronal systems’ connectivity and BOLD signal variability and their association
with dysfunction in neurotransmission and worsening of attacks; Aim3. Investigate whether 20 daily
lab/home-based unilateral and bilateral M11-2 HD-tDCS modulation have different effects on the molecular,
system, and clinical states in CM patients."
10799559,"Heterozygous mutations in two key metabolic genes, isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 and -2 (IDH1/2), are
present in up to 20% of newly diagnosed AML patients. IDH1/2 enzymes convert isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate
(aKG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH1/2 mutations impart a neomorphic enzyme activity, leading to
the conversion of aKG to the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG competitively inhibits aKG-
dependent dioxygenases, which induces profound epigenetic alterations and impaired hematopoietic
differentiation. IDH1/2 inhibitors are now FDA-approved for AML, although these agents typically are not
curative, with complete response (CR) rates and median overall survival (OS) ranging between 20-30% and
~8-12 months, respectively. In addition, primary and acquired resistance to mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors commonly
occurs. The inability to achieve a cure with these drugs as a monotherapy in part can be attributed to their
mechanism of action. Specifically, these drugs act in a cytostatic manner via the induction of differentiation,
which is highlighted by persistence of mutant IDH1/2 clones in the majority of patients, even those who achieve
a CR. These data underscore the need to develop alternative approaches to target IDH1/2-mutant AML.
 Our team recently discovered that IDH1/2 mutations induce a DNA damage response (DDR) defect which
confers sensitivity to poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that
2HG-induced inhibition of the lysine demethylase, KDM4B, results in aberrant hypermethylation of histone 3
lysine 9 (H3K9) at loci surrounding DNA breaks, masking a local H3K9 trimethylation signal that is essential for
the proper execution of homologous recombination (HR), a key DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair
pathway. We also extended these findings to other TCA gene mutations which create oncometabolites, which
we have collectively termed “oncometabolite-induced BRCAness”. Our work suggests that oncometabolite-
induced BRCAness is tumor type-agnostic, and we are now directly translating this work into multiple clinical
trials, which currently are testing the efficacy of PARP inhibitors against IDH1/2-mutant cancers, including AML
(NCT03953898; the PRIME trial; PI: Prebet).
 It is now well-established that IDH1/2 mutations induce DDR defects in AML, and here we propose to
study: (a) the impact of common, co-occurring mutations in AML on the associated DDR defect, which will be
critical for therapeutic targeting; (b) which DDR inhibitors will be most effective, and whether combinations with
other systemic agents in AML will increase efficacy; and (c) the extent to which our DDR inhibitor-based
strategies will be effective against tumors with intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. These studies have
the potential to establish an entirely new therapeutic approach for newly diagnosed and relapsed IDH1/2-
mutant AML, which exploits DDR defects identified by our team. By focusing on drugs which are either FDA-

10799704,"Project Summary (Abstract)
Research: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disorder in the US, affecting about 100,000
Americans, and about 1 in 400 African American live births, incurring annual health care costs of $335 million.
SCD complications lead to significant declines in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), culminating in early
mortality, particularly among adolescents and young adults (AYA). Hydroxyurea (HU) reduces morbidity and
mortality, improves HRQOL and lowers healthcare utilization. Low HU adherence is common and has been
associated with worse health outcomes, poor HRQOL and increased healthcare utilization. Our preliminary
data suggested that low HU adherence was associated with worse HRQOL scores. However, the longitudinal
relationship between HU adherence and HRQOL remains unclear. Our pilot data also suggest that AYA with
SCD are interested in using a multi-function SCD-app to facilitate disease self-management and to improve HU
adherence, which we were able to develop a prototype for (HU-Go app). The specific aims for Dr. Badawy's
research project are to: (1) Determine the longitudinal relationship of HU adherence behavior to health-related
quality of life, barriers to adherence and habit formation among AYA with SCD; (2) Refine the design of HU-Go
using an iterative user-centered design approach and determine the usability and usefulness of the refined HU-
Go app; and (3) Test the feasibility and acceptability of the HU-Go app as an mHealth behavioral intervention
to improve HU adherence among AYA with SCD. Candidate: Dr. Badawy is a pediatric hematologist. The
support of this career development award will help Dr. Badawy become an independent physician-investigator
with the training and experience necessary to improve medication adherence behavior and HRQOL in
adolescents with SCD using mHealth behavioral interventions. Dr. Badawy will use this award to build on his
existing foundation in health services and outcomes research to develop expertise in: (1) mHealth behavioral
interventions research and the application of user-centered design principles; (2) developmental and behavior
change theory as it relates to medication adherence with particular focus on AYA; (3) use of mobile technologies
for clinical outcomes assessment, including, HRQOL; (4) advanced biostatistics; and (5) behavioral clinical
trials for mHealth-based interventions. These skills will enable Dr. Badawy to establish an independent,
programmatic line of research and build a transdisciplinary research team to integrate behavioral and
technological approaches to improve health outcomes and HRQOL in adolescents with SCD. Dr. Badawy will
achieve these career objectives through a 5-year career development plan that involves structured didactics,
patient-oriented experiential research, and intensive mentoring. Environment: The exceptional institutional
environment will be critical to support Dr. Badawy's career development, including the (1) Dedicated resources
from the Department of Pediatrics, (2) Strong research infrastructure at Northwestern University (NU), and (3)
Established collaborations between Lurie Children's Hospital and NU Feinberg School of Medicine."
10799709,"Summary: Prenatal stress is pervasive and negatively impacts both the mother and the developing fetus;
offspring bear an increased risk of aberrant neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, there is a
critical window in utero where neurodevelopment is vulnerable to stress-induced alterations in the intrauterine
environment, including inflammation; how alterations in the maternal milieu are transmitted to the developing
brain, contributing to behavioral alterations, requires scrutinizing. We have established a mouse model of
prenatal stress, which in addition to altering maternal and offspring microbiota, induces inflammation in utero,
including increases in the chemokine C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), resulting in reduced social
behaviors and longstanding neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we have exciting supporting and preliminary data
suggesting that normal neurodevelopment is disrupted by prenatal stress in a microbe- and CCL2-dependent
manner. As a chemokine, CCL2 has a key role in both attracting myeloid cells and enhancing their
inflammatory profile. Within the brain, the myeloid compartment includes microglia, the resident macrophages
of the central nervous system; border-associated macrophages (BAMs), which are found in the perivascular
space, choroid plexus, and meninges; and circulating monocytes. However, the effects of prenatal stress and
CCL2 on the composition of and cytokine production by these subpopulations has yet to be elucidated, and is
critical as cytokine signaling is important for homeostatic functions during neurodevelopment, including
regulating neuro- and gliogenesis. Therefore, the goal of this R01 is to investigate the relationship between
prenatal stress, brain macrophages and monocytes, and social behavior. Our model of prenatal stress will be
used to test the highly novel, and integrative hypothesis that, during prenatal stress, there are alterations in the
composition of brain macrophages and monocytes in the fetal brain, increasing cytokine production, influencing
neurodevelopment. Next, we will determine whether cell-specific elimination of CCL2 production is able to
prevent neuroinflammation and subsequent alterations in social behavior. Finally, in an exploratory aim, we will
test whether alterations in the maternal microbiome are necessary and sufficient to induce the persistent
neuroinflammation and concomitant reduction in social behavior in adult offspring. Our overarching
hypothesis is that prenatal stress leads to fetal neuroinflammation that results in long term behavioral
abnormalities by altering the composition of macrophages and monocytes in the developing brain and
increasing their inflammatory profile, which is driven by disruption of maternal microbes and CCL2.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing these aims: 1) Determining whether prenatal stress alters the
composition of fetal brain macrophages and monocytes 2) Elucidating whether CCL2 drives inflammation in
fetal macrophages and monocytes following prenatal stress 3) Determining whether prenatal stress-induced
microbiome disruptions drive offspring neuroinflammation and reduced social behaviors."
10796294,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with a poor prognosis and accounts for
upwards of 95% of all pancreatic cancers. With the rise in incidence, PDAC will soon be the second leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite recent progress in the development of more
effective combinatorial chemotherapy treatments, survival has remained poor because of chemotherapy-
associated toxicity, inherent or acquired chemoresistance, and the lack of biomarkers to match patients with
specific chemotherapeutic agents. Oncolytic virotherapy (alone or as a part of a combination treatment) is a
relatively new anticancer approach that utilizes replication-competent viruses to infect and destroy cancer cells
(without damaging normal tissues) through virus replication and virus-induced antitumor immune responses.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is one such oncolytic virus (OV) and is already in phase I clinical trials against
different malignancies. In our previous studies, we analyzed various VSV-based OVs against many PDAC cell
lines and made an initial characterization of PDAC lines regarding their general cellular characteristics and
permissiveness to VSV. Our studies demonstrated that VSV is effective against the majority of tested human
PDAC cell lines. However, some PDAC cell lines show various degrees of resistance to VSV and other OVs,
mainly due to residual or upregulated JAK/STAT antiviral signaling or inefficient attachment of viruses to some
PDACs. Our goal is to better understand and target factors determining the success of VSV-based OV therapy,
enhance OV efficacy, overcome the resistance of PDACs to OVs, and broaden the spectrum of PDAC
phenotypes to which this treatment can be successfully applied. This proposal is based on our recently
published and preliminary studies using an experimental evolution approach. Using this approach, we have
generated novel PDAC-targeted oncolytic VSV variants that are better able to infect and kill PDAC cells without
harming non-malignant cells. In Aim 1, we will determine molecular mechanisms responsible for the improved
oncoselectivity of these novel viruses. In Aim 2, we will examine the efficacy and safety of our state-of-the-art
virus VSV-p53-CCSUIT-2 alone or in combination with FDA-approved drug Ruxolitinib (Jakafi, a selective JAK1
and JAK2 inhibitor) and/or anti-PD-1 antibody using clinically-relevant immunocompetent orthotopic mouse
models of PDAC. The triple [VSV-p53-CCSUIT-2/Ruxolitinib/anti-PD-1 antibody] combination is expected to
increase not only VSV replication and virus-mediated direct oncolysis via Ruxolitinib-mediated inhibition of Type
I IFN antiviral signaling, but also anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy via Ruxolitinib-mediated inhibition of JAK-
STAT-mediated tumor-protective responses. Our studies will lead to the development of more effective VSV-
based oncolytic therapies and broaden the spectrum of PDAC phenotypes to which this treatment can be
successfully applied. While this proposal is focused on VSV against PDAC, our discoveries will also be relevant
to other OVs and tumor systems."
10801903,"Healthy aging is a critical goal for the human population, and one solution to this problem is to extend healthspan and
lifespan. In model organisms including rodents and non-human primates, caloric restriction (CR) is the most effective
intervention for improving aging-related deterioration of biological functions and for extending lifespan. However,
despite more than 80 years since its discovery, the underlying mechanisms for how caloric restriction extends lifespan
are still largely unknown. A number of pathways have been associated with longevity including those involved with
nutrient signaling, metabolism, growth, genome stability and oxidative stress. Our laboratories have been studying the
behavioral effects of caloric restriction in mice and have found that CR leads to dramatic changes in the pattern of food
intake. In contrast to normally fed mice, which distribute their food intake over the 24-hour day, mice on caloric
restriction adopt a severe feeding and fasting pattern in which they consume all of their food within a few hours each
day. In order to disentangle the contribution of calories, fasting and circadian alignment of eating on longevity, we
recently showed that CR is sufficient to extend lifespan but that the pattern and circadian-alignment of feeding under CR
acts synergistically to extend lifespan in male C57BL/6J mice. Calorie reduction alone increases lifespan only by ~10%,
while time-restricted CR during the active phase extends lifespan more than 3 times longer (35%). Circadian alignment
of feeding enhances CR-mediated benefits on survival independently of fasting duration and body weight. In Aim 1,
because we have found that CR with time-restricted feeding (TRF) extends lifespan from 10% to 35%, we will test
whether TRF without CR can extend lifespan. In Aim 2, we will test whether enhanced Clock gene expression can rescue
the age-related decline in circadian gene expression and can improve health and extend lifespan. Aging promotes
widespread increases in inflammation and decreases in metabolism in the livers from ad lib (AL) fed mice; whereas CR at
night ameliorates these aging-related changes. In our previous work, we found that the gene expression of the cytokine,
Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), is directly correlated with lifespan across 6 feeding conditions (AL vs. 5 CR groups). In Aim 3,
we will test the hypothesis that IL-1b is necessary for the effects of CR on lifespan and whether calories, fasting and
circadian alignment of feeding differentially effect lifespan in Il-1b null mice. In summary, we will test: whether circadian
interventions such as TRF or genetic enhancement of CLOCK transcription can extend healthspan and lifespan and
whether IL-1b is critical for these effects."

Life, as we know it, has changed due to COVID-19. Existing health disparities among
underserved communities were exacerbated. Latinos and Native Hawaiians and Pacific
Islanders (NHPI) disproportionately experience disparities in health, even when compared to
other minority populations. Both populations have heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as
leading causes of death; and both Latinos and NHPIs have high rates of obesity. As we begin to
recover from the pandemic, we must consider the intersection of continued health disparities,
new social norms and attitudes, and new patterns of health behavior.
The overarching goal of this project is to reduce health disparities among Latinos and Native
NHPIs, considering new health behavior patterns, social norms, and increased technology use
related to COVID-19. The research project specific aims are to: (1) conduct key informant
interviews and focus groups among Latinos and NHPIs, (2) develop and implement a
community health and health behavior survey, and (3) based on community feedback [from
aims 1 and 2], co-design, develop and test new technology, in collaboration with the CSUSM
Innovation Hub, that is meaningful and responsive to community needs and preferences.
Additionally, with commitment to training students underrepresented in biomedical research, we
were purposeful in outlining research capacity specific aims. They are, to: (1) enhance the
research capacity of students underrepresented in biomedical research, especially towards
training future independent health disparity researchers and scholars, and (2) enhance the
research capacity, sustainability, and excellence of CSUSM through meaningful collaborations
between the principle investigator and the CSUSM Innovation Hub, OTRES (for recruitment of
underrepresented students), and other collaborators and community partners.
We will use a Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach and formative
research to co-design, develop and test new technology, an mHealth smartphone application,
based on community insights. Components will likely include strategies to improve obesity-
related health behaviors and mental health. Research capacity: We will evaluate the
demographics and number of students involved in research, including student outcomes (e.g.,
posters, papers, and graduate school application/acceptance rates). We will also evaluate
attitudes, satisfaction, trust, and perceived impact of the collaboration. The proposed research
lays the foundation for purposeful and progressive funding (i.e., this R16, STTR, R21, R01) that
will advance the science and innovation in health disparities research."
10805385,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading cause of stroke and an increasingly prevalent arrhythmia in the United States
due to an aging population with predisposing comorbidities (e.g. heart failure, obesity, diabetes, high blood
pressure, etc.). Although there have been great technological advances in the treatment of AF, current therapies
still remain insufficient due to limited understanding of the mechanisms that drive and maintain AF. Clinical
studies lack reliable functional and structural mapping approaches necessary to resolve the patient-specific
arrhythmogenic transmural substrate, due to the highly complex 3D structure of the human atria. Subsequently,
there remains a significant debate around the mechanisms driving AF, the cause of these drivers, and how best
to locate and treat these patient-specific drivers that can occur in both left and right atrial chambers.
Therefore, our proposal aims to develop a novel, paradigm-shifting translational framework that uses ex-vivo to
in-vivo 3D multimodal imaging approaches to accurately define disease- and sex-specific bi-atrial
arrhythmogenic substrates of AF drivers, so that we can elucidate the “fingerprint” features of AF drivers. Our
preliminary data led us to hypothesize that disease- and sex-specific fibrotic cellular and extracellular remodeling
is heterogeneously present in one or more LA and RA transmural layers (sub-epi, intramural, and sub-endo) and
can form arrhythmogenic substrates for localized reentrant AF drivers and represent personalized targets for AF
treatment. We will test this hypothesis, directly in explanted human atria and a preclinical animal AF model, by
integrating transmural optical mapping, clinical multi-electrode mapping, 3D MRI and PET/CT imaging, and
proteo-transcriptomic analyses to define chamber- and disease-specific signaling pathways and structural-
molecular-genetic fingerprints of arrhythmogenic AF driver substrates. The validated AF driver substrate
fingerprints will be used to train machine learning algorithms to define patient-specific targets in persistent AF
patients for either substrate modulating ablation of reentrant tracks (SMART) or anti-fibrotic therapeutic

mechanism-based, and sex-specific AF treatments whereby driver substrates can be accurately defined,
targeted, and successfully treated to cure the most common arrhythmia in the United States."

The ability to enhance cognition by targeting circulating factors in the systemic milieu provides a unique and
underexplored therapeutic approach to brain aging. We and others have shown that systemic manipulations,
including exposure to young blood through heterochronic parabiosis (in which the circulatory system of a young
and old animal are joined) and young blood plasma administration, revitalize the aged hippocampus and
ameliorate cognitive decline in aged mice. The rejuvenating effects of young blood mirror those observed with
exercise, positing common bloodborne mechanisms of action by which broad systemic interventions exert their
beneficial effects. Preliminary data from our labs indicate that systemic administration of platelet factors derived
from either naïve young mice or exercised mice reverses age-related impairments in adult neurogenesis,
deceases neuroinflammation and restores cognitive function in aged mice. Moreover, using proteomics, our two
groups have independently identified CXCL4/platelet factor 4 (PF4)—a chemokine released from platelets,
involved in coagulation and a variety of immunomodulatory functions—as a potential young blood-derived and
exercise-induced anti-geronic circulating factor. The proposed study will investigate the rejuvenating and
therapeutic effects of platelet factors on the aged brain. Specifically, our hypothesis is that systemic exposure to
platelet factors rejuvenates adult neurogenesis, attenuates neuroinflammation and improves cognition, while
ameliorating neurodegenerative phenotypes. We will test this theory with three specific aims: 1: Determine
mechanisms downstream of PF4 underlying cognitive and regenerative rejuvenation in the aged hippocampus.
2: Examine the rejuvenating effects of PF4 on neuroinflammation in the aged hippocampus. 3: Investigate the
beneficial effects of PF4 in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of these studies will
have significant translational potential, identifying platelet-derived circulating factors as candidate therapeutic
targets to restore age-related cognitive dysfunction and potentially treat dementia-related neurodegenerative
disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease."

Therapeutic advances in vascular disease may have far-reaching public benefits. Arteriovenous malformations
(AVMs) are the common feature of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and cause the high risk of life-
threatening complications. Advanced studies have shown that loss function of mutations in activin receptor-like
kinase 1 (ALK1) are linked to HHT type 2 (HHT2) and ALK1 gene deletion in mice causes AVMs. Previous
studies also reveal that ALK1 is predominantly expressed in arterial endothelial cells (ECs). However, it is
unknown if ALK1 deficiency allows arterial ECs to acquire ill characteristics resulting in AVMs. In present
proposal, we have obtained preliminary data to suggest that the emerging lymphatic endothelial characteristics
in arterial ECs through the induction of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is previously unknown mechanism of
AVMs in endothelial ALK1 deficiency, and we show that the approaches of erasing these undesired
characteristics reduce AVMs. Therefore, we hypothesize that ALK1 deficiency elevates MDM2 to cause AVMs
through the induction of lymphatic endothelial characteristics in arterial ECs, and MDM2 inhibition abolishes
these characteristics to reduce AVMs. In specific Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying arterial
MDM2 induction as a causative factor of AVMs in endothelial ALK1 deficiency. In specific Aim 2, we will
determine the contribution of arterial MDM2 induction to human HHT2. In specific Aim 3, we will determine if
limiting MDM2 reduces AVMs in endothelial ALK1-deficient mice. There is no primary medical treatment to
prevent or reduce the AVMs of HHT2 patients. In this proposal, we discover a novel mechanism that reveals the
unwanted characteristics emerging in arterial ECs driven by ALK1 deficiency, and arterial ECs with these
characteristics cause AVMs. We identify a compound and propose a novel treatment paradigm aiming to
ameliorate AVMs by erasing these ill characteristics from arterial ECs. If succussed, our proposed studies would
reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of alterations in arterial ECs of HHT2 and provide insight into new
opportunities for therapeutic interventions."

Excess reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) from radiation, polluted air, as well as chemicals in food
and water induce oxidative stress and cause direct damage to nucleotide bases. A prominent form of oxidized
damage in the genome and free nucleotide pools is 8-oxoG or 8-oxo-dGTP, respectively. 8-oxoG can hydrogen
bond with adenine, resulting in mutations upon DNA replication. 8-oxoG also produces double strand breaks
(DSBs) that undergo error-prone repair through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). This results in
mutagenesis and genomic instability.
 DNA polymerases mediate repair of oxidative DNA damage. A major obstacle to understanding the
etiology and progression of diseases caused by oxidative stress is that the DNA polymerase mechanism
employed in the repair of oxidative lesions and effects of accessory factors in the DNA repair complex remain
poorly understood. Solving this problem will enable a more complete understanding of the role of DNA
polymerases in cancer, aging and disease. The knowledge gained will enable development of therapies to target
cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and aging.
 I will uncover the impact of oxidative stress-induced DNA repair on genome integrity by determining how
active site contacts and dynamics in polymerases influence repair outcomes. I will also relate my observations
to accessory repair factors and larger repair complexes. To accomplish this task, I will use pH jump
crystallography to determine snapshots that will reveal the active site contacts and dynamics employed by NHEJ
polymerases λ and μ to insert and extend from an 8-oxoG lesion (Aim 1, K99 phase). The functional significance
of these contacts will be verified using kinetic assays and mutant enzymes. I hypothesize that these contacts
regulate the unique behavior of these polymerases in promoting productive and accurate synthesis and provide
insight into the role of 8-oxoG in mutagenesis. I will then employ a combination of transient kinetics and time-
lapse crystallography to determine the atomic level contacts and dynamics employed by polymerases λ and μ
to perform translesion synthesis past and proofreading of the 8-oxoG lesion (Aim 2, R00 phase). The structural
intermediates determined in this aim will allow understanding of the structural requirements for mutation prone
bypass of 8-oxoG. Building on the results of the latter two aims and training during the K99 period, I will determine
the role of substrate channeling among accessory factors during oxidative DNA damage induced NHEJ (Aim 3,
R00 phase). Cryo-EM studies will enable determination of how the dynamic and heterogenous populations of
NHEJ repair complexes impact oxidative DNA damage repair. I will also determine the structural basis for 8-
oxoG processing by Artemis during oxidative NHEJ repair. Completion of this aim will require training in Cryo-
EM that will be provided by Dr. Mario Borgnia.
 The knowledge gained as a result of the work on how polymerases impact repair of oxidative damage
and how this mediates productive repair will provide a significant advance in the understanding of how
environmental agent induced DNA damage repair. I will gain expertise in state-of-the-art methods such as
crystallography, transient kinetics, cryo-EM, DNA replication and DNA repair that will help me achieve my career
goals and establish an independent laboratory."

10787041,"Abstract
It is well established that aging is accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation that correlates well with
mortality and morbidity, but the association between aging and inflammation is not well understood. Similarly,
changes in DNA cytosine methylation occur reproducibly with age, suggesting that DNA methylation contributes
to the aging process, but the biology remains unclear. Certain families of transposable elements (TEs) are
repressed in somatic cells via DNA methylation; moreover, TEs are activated in aging mice and in cultured
human cells undergoing replicative senescence, and increased TE expression leads to DNA damage, mutations
and inflammation. These consequences have all been observed in cells from aged individuals, but the underlying
mechanisms are obscure. Understanding the mechanistic basis for the association of aging with inflammation
and changes in DNA methylation will be essential to design rational interventions for age-associated disorders.
Here we tackle the question of how changes in DNA methylation relate to inflammation during aging. DNA
methylation is regulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and TET methylcytosine oxidases, which control
DNA methylation and demethylation respectively. DNMT deficiency predictably results in decreased DNA
methylation, but TET deficiency is paradoxically also associated with a striking loss of DNA methylation in hetero-
chromatin. Moreover, TET and/or DNMT-deficient cells show increased TE expression and cell-intrinsic
inflammation, similar to that observed in cells from aged humans and senescent cells in culture. We will test the
hypothesis that aging involves a progressive decrease in TET and/or DNMT activity with age, leading to selective
losses of DNA methylation in heterochromatin where repressed TEs reside, and hence in increased TE
expression and cell-intrinsic (“sterile”) inflammation. In Aim 1, we will define the DNA modification (5mC, 5hmC)
status of transposable elements in immune cells (CD4+ T lymphocytes and monocytes) of young, middle-aged
and old healthy subjects from the BLSA and GESTALT cohorts at NIA, and relate them to the observed increase
in expression of TEs as a function of age. These studies probe the hypothesis that decline of TET and/or DNMT
activity with age dysregulates TE expression. In Aim 2, we will correlate increased TE expression in immune
cells from the BLSA and GESTALT cohorts with signatures of inflammation and serum levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines during aging. In Aim 3, we will perform complementary studies in genetically tractable mouse models
of clonal hematopoiesis, a malady of both aging and inflammation. Using mice deficient in Tet2 and/or Dnmt3a,
we will define the development of heterochromatic DNA hypomethylation and inflammation in immune cells of
these mice with age, and determine the relation to increased TE expression. Our studies will test the novel
hypothesis of a link between TET/DNMT deficiency, loss of heterochromatic DNA methylation and increased TE
expression with age, and deepen our understanding of the elusive mechanisms that connect heterochromatin
dysfunction with inflammation, aging and oncogenesis."

 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients make up 90-95% of all diagnosed diabetes mellitus and show
serious cognitive and mood deficits that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, poor self-care,
and decreased life quality. These deficits are linked to brain tissue changes, potentially resulting from impaired
blood brain barrier (BBB) function. However, it is unclear whether BBB function can be repaired in T2DM
adults, reducing impaired cognition and mood functions and early risks of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
The BBB restricts diffusion of microscopic objects (such as bacteria) and large (e.g., antibodies and many
drugs) or hydrophilic molecules (e.g., salt) from crossing into brain tissue and protects from harmful
substances. Although multiple methods, including positron emission tomography, single photon emission
computed tomography, and contrast-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can examine BBB function,
they are either invasive or pose significant health risks on humans. Using non-invasive MRI based diffusion-
weighted pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DW-pCASL), BBB function status can be examined, which
has been validated to examine BBB breakdown in pre-clinical and in pilot T2DM studies. Several pre-clinical
studies suggest the possibility for BBB function repair, including low-cost thiamine intervention. Thiamine is an
essential component for carbohydrate metabolism and adequate or higher levels promote aerobic metabolism.
In addition, reduced thiamine levels are shown contributing to impaired endothelial cell functions, leading to
BBB dysfunction, and higher doses improve endothelial functions. Although the majority of T2DM adults show
thiamine deficiency that may contribute to impaired BBB function, but it is unclear if the thiamine treatment can
improve BBB function. Therefore, using 52 T2DM adults with randomized clinical trial, the specific aims are to:
1) compare BBB function, using DW-pCASL, and blood serum BBB (S100β levels) biomarkers in T2DM adults
with and without thiamine treatment and 2) examine cognition (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and
Learning 2 and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and mood (Beck Depression Inventory II and Beck Anxiety
Inventory) between T2DM adults with thiamine treatment compared to T2DM adults without thiamine
treatment. In summary, low-cost thiamine treatment will be performed to assess whether impaired BBB
function and mood and cognition deficits are improved in T2DM adults. If successful, the information from this
clinical trial might serve as a novel and innovative treatment strategy to repair BBB function, affecting less
cognition and mood function, and hence better outcomes in T2DM adults. This R21 clinical trial study will
provide required data regarding the benefits of a low-cost thiamine intervention that could be implemented on a
large-scale clinical trial to repair BBB function, and thus, decrease early dementia and Alzheimer’s disease,
reduce morbidity and mortality, and increase quality of life in T2DM adults."

 The goal of this proposed project titled “Sympathetic Activation of Renal Dendritic Cells during
Hypertension” is to investigate the role of renal dendritic cell (rDC) adrenergic receptor (AR) activation in
mediating cytokine-induced increases in sodium (Na) transporter activity and blood pressure (BP). Increased
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is known to play a role in hypertension (HTN). Additionally, there is
an accepted role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of HTN. However, there is little data linking all these
physiological mechanisms in salt-sensitive HTN.
 DCs cells secrete interleukin 6 (IL-6) producing a pro-inflammatory milieu. Our preliminary data show
that rDCs are necessary for salt-sensitive HTN (SS-HTN) and intra-renal IL-6 levels. Using RNAseq analysis of
whole kidney homogenates, we observed a change in the enrichment/Reactome pathway regulating AR
expression and signaling mechanisms. These changes were observed in mice lacking rDCs, suggesting a role
for AR in SS-HTN. Our robust in vivo data suggest that IL-6 infusion increases phosphorylated (pT53) NCC and
ENaC activity. We also show that IL-6, plus high salt (HS, 4%), increases BP after 3 days following an immediate
(day 1) reduction in urinary Na and total urinary volume. Together, these data strongly support a role for rDC-
mediating local IL-6 levels, IL-6 increasing Na transporter expression and/or activity as well as Na-dependent
BP. In this proposal, we hypothesize that SNS-mediated AR activation on rDCs increases intrarenal IL-6 levels,
activating distal tubular Na transporters and increasing blood pressure. We will investigate this using an
immortalized DC line (DC2.5), as well as freshly isolated rDCs. We will use radiotelemetry and mice lacking renal
DCs in a norepinephrine infusion model of HTN, as well as renal denervation during SS-HTN. These in vivo
studies will show dependence on rDCs for sympathetically-mediated HTN and renal innervation for renal IL-6."
10793467,"Regulation of bone homeostasis and remodeling by long noncoding RNA Malat1
Bone homeostasis is maintained by constant and dynamic remodeling between osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption and osteoblast/osteocyte-mediated bone formation. The balance of bone remodeling process,
however, is often disrupted in pathological conditions, such as in osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.
The mechanisms that regulate bone remodeling are not fully understood. Recent genomic studies have
unveiled functional long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and targeting lncRNAs provided exciting new
diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for human diseases. The lncRNAs involved in bone remodeling,
however, are underappreciated. Malat1 is one of the most conserved and abundant nuclear lncRNAs. The
function of Malat1 is unknown in bone homeostasis and remodeling. We revealed, for the first time, that
Malat1 KO mice exhibit significant osteoporotic bone phenotype characterized with enhanced osteoclastic
bone resorption, but reduced osteoblastic bone formation in vivo. Thus, Malat1 deletion uncoupled the
normal bone remodeling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Malat1 acts cell-autonomously in
osteoblasts to promote osteoblast differentiation, but suppresses osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous
manner in vivo. Moreover, Malat1 modulates crosstalk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Mechanistically, Malat1 deficiency significantly reduced nuclear localization of β-catenin during
osteoblastogenesis. The genes enriched in pathways of osteoblast signaling, ossification, and Wnt/β-
catenin pathway were selectively and significantly suppressed in Malat1 KO osteoblasts. These findings
identify lncRNA Malat1 as a novel bone remodeling regulator that impacts skeletal homeostasis by
controlling both bone formation and resorption.
 In this application, we will apply robust genetic approaches to investigate the functional importance
of Malat1 in osteoblast lineage and the mechanisms by which Malat1 regulates osteogenesis and
osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk. Specifically, we will 1) dissect and define the function of Malat1 in
osteoblast lineage at various stages of differentiation in vivo using genetic approaches; 2) investigate the
mechanisms by which Malat1 regulates osteogenesis and osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will introduce functional lncRNAs into bone field, yield novel insights
into lncRNA-mediated mechanisms that regulate bone homeostasis and remodeling, and will provide a
rational framework for developing lncRNA-based new or alternative therapeutic approaches for skeletal
diseases."

Epigenetic variation, especially DNA methylation, has been associated with numerous complex diseases.
Epigenetic age is a fairly recent measurement that is associated with an individual’s biological age, and has
recently been shown to contribute to general mortality, specifically with cardiovascular disease. Abundant
evidence demonstrates that specific interventions (e.g., exercise, diet, smoking cessation) can alter, and more
importantly improve, an individual’s epigenetic age acceleration. Although research has addressed attitudes
and uptake of specific genetic tests, we do not know whether patients would want information about their
epigenetic age or, among those who want their results, how they would respond to receipt of results.
Furthermore, we are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of understanding perspectives held by
underrepresented populations about the use and implementation of genomic technology. However, such
knowledge is often limited. To address this gap in knowledge and to ensure that perspectives of underserved
minorities are not overlooked, we will conduct semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 40 1st and 2nd
generation Mexican immigrant adults for whom their existing epigenetic age has already been determined as
part of a currently funded grant (# R01 MD017006). The interviewer will elicit detailed responses from the
participants about perceived benefits and drawbacks of being informed about their epigenetic age, and ask
whether they want to receive their epigenetic age test result. Those who opt to receive their epigenetic age will
receive them, and then will immediately be asked to briefly respond to a few open-ended questions. Three
months later, all participants will engage in a final semi-structured, in-depth interview about the perceived
benefits and drawbacks of being able to receive one’s epigenetic age. Through systematic analysis of interview
transcripts, we will (1) delineate the perceived benefits and drawbacks to receiving results of epigenetic age
test results reported by 1st and 2nd generation Mexican immigrant adults prior to receipt of test results, and (2)
identify and delineate the perceived benefits and drawbacks to receiving results of epigenetic age test results
reported by 1st and 2nd generation Mexican immigrant adults immediately, and three months after, receipt of
test results. We will also determine if responses vary by the difference between each participant’s biological
and chronological age."

 The purpose of the proposed study is to test the short-term efficacy of a cancer parenting education
program for child-rearing parents diagnosed with non-curable cancer, called Enhancing Connections-Palliative
Care Program (EC-PC). The program consists of fully scripted intervention sessions that will be delivered by
telephone by a specially trained patient educator. The EC-PC has been pilot tested and is ready for efficacy
testing. Parents will be eligible if they are diagnosed with non-curable cancer [determined by TNM Stage IV
cancer for hard tumors or 2 or more cycles of treatment failure with disease relapse in non-solid tumors]; read,
write and speak English as one of their languages of choice; have a child between the ages of 5-17 living in the
home at least 50% of the time with the ill parent and another non-ill parent or parent surrogate; and have access to a
telephone. Study participants will be recruited from 4 study centers: University of Washington/ Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance; Georgetown University/ Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of Hawaii/ Hawai’i
Cancer Center, and Southeast Oncology/University of South Carolina. After completing signed informed
consent and baseline measures, parents will be randomized to an experimental or alternative treatment control
group. The experimental group will receive 5 telephone-delivered educational sessions every 2 weeks by
specially trained patient educators. The control group will be mailed “What Should I Say to the Children?”, a
guide for parents with advanced cancer, and be phone contacted by a specially trained patient educator who
will use a script to guide the parent on ways to gain the most information from the booklet. Primary endpoints
for testing efficacy will be assessed at 3-months post-baseline using Linear Mixed Models using an intent to
treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis. Five primary outcomes will assess efficacy: parents' anxiety and
depressed mood; parents' skills in helping their child manage the toll of the parents' cancer; parents' self-
efficacy in talking with their child about the child's cancer-related concerns; and the child's anxious/depressed
mood. The stability of changes will be described and evaluated at 6- and 9-months. With estimated Effect sizes
of .33-81 on the primary outcomes, the study will have greater than 0.80 power to detect a significant
difference between the experimental and control group, p=.05 (2-tailed).
 Our sample for analysis will be 492 diagnosed parents and their 492 non-ill coinhabiting partners/parent
surrogates of children ages 5-17. In addition to testing efficacy, the proposed study will test the theoretical
model of the intervention using structural equation modeling with confirmatory factor analysis; evaluate the
impact of the intervention on children’s behavioral-emotional adjustment whose parents die during the study
using Linear Mixed Models on data obtained from the non-ill parent; and examine the moderating effects of
parents' symptom burden and family environment on treatment outcomes using Linear Mixed Models."

This R61/R33 project will develop an advanced technology for non-invasive recording of whole-brain physiology
with synchronized video-tracking of movement for use in children with intellectual disability and will use it to
elucidate the brain-circuit electrophysiology of intellectual development. The technological advances will have
immediate benefits for pediatric neurology and will be widely applicable to many neurological disorders in which
safe and convenient, non-invasive recordings of brain physiology are desired to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and
treatment. The R61 phase will be performed by FieldLine Medical (Boulder, CO) which will contribute their recent
advances in optically-pumped magnetometer magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG), a transformative
technology for safe, physiological brain imaging that greatly increases sensitivity to brain electrical signals as
compared to SQUID-MEG and EEG and provides greater coverage than invasive electrophysiology. FieldLine
will: 1) expand the capabilities of their HEDscan OPM-MEG system, as a “wearable” brainwave scanning
technology, for high-fidelity MEG recordings in freely moving children; and 2) integrate synchronized video-
tracking of voluntary movements for kinematic analysis to create a technology named HEDscanV. The R33
phase will deploy HEDscanV in two pediatric neuroscience laboratories at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
and Seattle Children's Research Institute. After validating HEDscanV in children against SQUID-MEG, the R33
phase will leverage advances in autism research enabled by sensory, motor, and associative learning paradigms
that were developed by the MPIs to identify intellectual disability with high accuracy. By disseminating HEDscanV
and sensory-motor paradigms across clinical sites in Philadelphia and Seattle, we will work together to identify
the bandwidths of electrical activity coherence in brain circuits at the interface of movement and cognition that
promote intellectual development. Our success will be ensured by the support of two nationally-recognized
autism centers at the University of Washington and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where high-fidelity clinical
assessments and diagnostic testing will be conducted. By establishing the locations and bandwidths of activity
coherence in the brains of children that promote intellectual development, the project will begin to lay the
essential groundwork needed to establish therapies intending to normalize brain pathophysiology and facilitate
intellectual development in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."

TAM receptors are a clinically important and mechanistically under-studied RTK subfamily. These receptors have
a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through the clearance of apoptotic cells and control of
inflammatory and immune responses. Linked to their important regulatory roles, dysregulation of TAM
receptors is implicated in numerous disease states including cardiovascular disease, hereditary blindness,
infertility, autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammation and cancer. In addition, TAM receptor mediated
signaling pathways can be hijacked by viruses to gain entry into host cells. While there is growing interest in
TAM receptors as therapeutic targets, their multiple roles in homeostatic processes create challenges for
developing therapeutic strategies. Understanding TAM receptor activation mechanisms is important for further
investigation of the potential development of targeted therapies. While these receptors are commonly believed
to be activated through classical receptor-induced dimerization, my preliminary work presents the first in-depth
study of the biochemistry and suggests that this simplified view may not be applicable to TAM receptors.
Importantly, to fully understand how TAMs are activated, I intend to utilize a combination of structural,
biophysical and biochemical approaches to investigate TAM oligomerization and cross-talk with other receptors.
These studies will guide the development of informed theories of TAM receptor activation and provide
important insights that may be used for the development of new therapeutics in cancer and viral and
autoimmune diseases. The laboratory of Dr. Kathryn Ferguson at the Yale Cancer Biology Institute provides a
supportive and innovative research environment to conduct this research, as well as mentorship that is aimed
at improving skills necessary for a transition to independence. With access to a wealth of resources and to

T cell exhaustion is a differentiation state that is marked by the loss of effector function and increased
expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1. Although virus-specific CD8 T cells are commonly considered
as a homogeneous population that gradually become exhausted over time, recent research has clearly
demonstrated that a CXCR5hi TCF-1hi subset is serving as a self-renewing progenitor population that can give
rise to a more terminally exhausted CXCR5lo TCF-1lo subset. To better dissect the heterogeneity of “exhausted”
CD8 T cells, the lab applied single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to the chronic LCMV infection and identified
three major subsets of virus-specific CD8 T cells that are phenotypically, functionally and transcriptionally
distinct. Not only had the lab validated the existence of these subsets of T cells experimentally by flow
cytometry, more advanced computational analyses were also performed to further predict their core
transcriptional networks and developmental trajectories. Collectively, the findings reveal that a TCF-1hi
progenitor subset can give rise to either a truly exhausted PD-1hi subset or a newly identified functional effector
population that is named CX3CR1hi subset. This discovery laid a solid framework that allows testing of how
extracellular signals and intrinsic genetic circuits regulate the formation and function of these three subsets of
CD8 T cells. More importantly, it provides unprecedented opportunities to explore the possibility of generating
more functional CX3CR1hi cells from TCF-1hi progenitors to overcome T cell exhaustion. This conceptual
breakthrough is obviously applicable to control over chronic viral infection as well as cancer. Intriguingly, the
preliminary study has also demonstrated that CD4 helper T cells, possibly through producing IL-21, are critical
for TCF-1hi  CX3CR1hi transition. This led to the hypothesis that inflammatory cytokines (such as CD4-
derived IL-21) modulate the cellular, functional and transcriptional diversity of virus-specific CD8 T cells during
chronic LCMV infection. Blocking antibodies, RNA interference and genetic deletion models will be used to
further dissect how inflammatory cytokines and transcriptional networks regulate heterogeneity in T cell
exhaustion. Furthermore, the lab proposes to redirect CD8 T cell differentiation away from “exhaustion” by
providing additional “CD4 help”, either alone or in combination with PD-1 blockade. The lab will test if providing
IL-21 producing CD4 T cells through adoptive transfer could drive TCF-1hi progenitor cell differentiation into
functional CX3CR1hi effector cells. Overall, knowledge gained from this research will provide mechanistic
insights into how to redirect the formation of functional effector T cells and simultaneously limit T cell
exhaustion for improved viral control over chronic infection."

 Type I interferons (IFN1, including IFNα and IFNβ) are critical regulators of intestinal epithelial
cells proliferation and of anti-tumor immune responses. Accordingly, pharmacologic IFN1 were
used in treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) alone or combined with the 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-
based chemotherapy. However, these approaches yielded underwhelming results indicating that
the endogenous pathway mediating IFN1 effects is somehow inactivated in CRC. Importantly, all
effects of endogenous or pharmacologic IFN1 require the IFNAR1 receptor chain, which is also
essential for the efficacy of the anti-cancer treatment regimens including radio- and
chemotherapies. Intriguingly, we recently found that the IFN1-IFNAR1 is indeed inactivated in
CRC. Our recently published data demonstrate that (a) IFNAR1 undergoes ubiquitination and
rapid degradation in response to tumor microenvironment factors such as tumor-derived vesicles,
(b) IFNAR1 is often downregulated in malignant and benign tumor cells in human CRC, and (c)
low levels of IFNAR1 correlates with poor survival of CRC patients who received standard
chemotherapies. Our additional pilot experiments were then focused on ability to overcome the
loss of IFNAR1 to restore the efficacy of chemotherapy. Data from these experiments showed a
promise for reactivation of the IFN1-IFNAR1 pathway using several approaches. These include a
novel and exciting small molecule sumoylation inhibitor TAK981, as well as reserpine, a
hypotensive drug preventing the effects of tumor-derived vesicles. In addition, exciting results are
obtained using a novel and unique mutant recombinant IFN1 (sIFN-I) that exhibits an increased
affinity to IFNAR1 and can act even at low IFNAR1 density. These recently published and pilot
data provide a firm support for an overarching hypothesis that the loss of IFNAR1 in CRC
undermines its treatment and, conversely, reactivation of the IFN1 pathway will increase the
efficacy of CRC chemotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we propose to (i) determine the
importance of IFNAR1 loss in responses of colorectal adenocarcinomas to 5-FU-containing
regimen (FOLFOX) with or without novel sIFN-I; (ii) reactivate the IFN1-IFNAR1 pathway using a
novel sumoylation inhibitor TAK981 to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy; and (iii) prevent
the loss of IFNAR1 by interfering with the effect of tumor-derived vesicles using reserpine to
increase the efficacy of FOLFOX. Completion of these studies should reveal a novel role of
inactivation of IFNAR1 in the sub-optimal efficacy of CRC therapy and to overcome this problem
through using the means to reactivate the IFN1-IFNAR1 pathway."
10795109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer, and more than 80% of lung cancers and lung cancer deaths are
caused by cigarette smoking. Lung cancer screening with annual low‐dose computed tomography is
recommended for long‐term current and former smokers, yet as few as 2% of 7.6 million eligible patients
receive lung cancer screening. Most of these patients are current smokers, yet few receive effective tobacco
treatment, with even larger care gaps among African American populations. This problem requires solutions at
multiple levels, as uptake of lung cancer screening and tobacco treatment are driven by both physician orders
and patient receipt of care. Novel, personalized efforts that target physicians and patients may boost uptake in
lung cancer screening and tobacco treatment. We propose a multi-level intervention featuring a precision risk
tool designed to stimulate guideline-concordant care by motivating behavior change and facilitating patient-
centered discussions between primary care physicians and medically underserved patients at risk for lung
cancer. This innovation is motivated by two key findings: 1) clinical and genetic factors inform precision risk for
lung cancer and smoking cessation, and 2) high desire for personal genetic risk feedback signals its potential
to activate behavior change. Building on important genomic advances, our team developed RiskProfile, a
physician- and patient-facing tool that can incorporate genetic risk feedback to promote evidence-based care
and cancer risk-reducing behaviors. The overarching goal of this study is to test the impact of RiskProfile,
either with or without genetic information and in comparison to usual care, on uptake of lung cancer screening
and tobacco treatment. We propose a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial of 75 physicians and 825
screen-eligible patients (11 per physician) from a diverse primary care setting. Physicians and patients will be
randomized to usual care vs. RiskProfile-Clin (based on clinical factors) vs. RiskProfile-Gen (based on clinical
and genetic factors) to evaluate the effect of precision risk interventions on lung cancer screening and tobacco
treatment. In Aims 1 and 2, we will test the effect of RiskProfile on physician orders and patient completion of
lung cancer screening and tobacco treatment. We predict that RiskProfile-Gen will outperform RiskProfile-Clin,
and that both groups will outperform usual care. Primary outcomes will be ordering and completion of lung
cancer screening among screen-eligible patients. Secondary outcomes will be ordering and receiving tobacco
treatment among screen-eligible current smokers. In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of RiskProfile on
potential mechanisms of behavior change (physician perceptions, patient cognitive or engagement factors, and
physician-patient interactions) that may increase uptake of lung cancer screening and tobacco treatment. By
targeting both physicians and patients and addressing both cancer screening and cessation care, this precision
risk feedback tool has potential to drive down lung cancer incidence and mortality in underserved populations."
10795110,"The long-term goal of this project is to develop respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidates for
elderly populations. RSV is a significant pathogen of the elderly rivaling influenza in its impact on the health of
this population. Currently it is estimated that RSV infections in the elderly result in 11,000 to 17,000 deaths per
year in the US and ten times that number of RSV associated hospitalizations. The worldwide population over
age 60 is predicted to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, more than a 20% increase over the current number. Such an
expansion in this population over the next few decades will pose a greatly increased public health burden
making development of elderly RSV vaccines an important priority.
 This project will develop novel virus-like particles (VLPs) as an RSV vaccine for elderly populations.
These VLPs contain the RSV pre-fusion F protein and the G protein and are built on the core proteins of the
avian Newcastle Disease Virus. They have been shown to be an effective vaccine in mice and cotton rats
(CR). Importantly, they induce high titers of anti-RSV neutralizing antibody titers in animals previously infected
with RSV (RSV primed), which mimics the adult human population. They are also effective as a maternal
vaccine protecting offspring of immunized animals from RSV challenge.
 In this project, we hypothesize that using an immunologically superior form of VLP associated pre-F
RSV protein in a reproducible and representative human model of RSV infections, we will be able to produce
enhanced protective RSV immune responses in the elderly that will surpass those of standard pre-F RSV
protein vaccines.
 Using RSV experienced, elderly cotton rats as human surrogates, we propose three specific aims to
develop these VLPs as an RSV vaccine for elderly populations.
 Aim 1: to ascertain if pre-fusion F VLP immunization of elderly CRs will recall RSV memory induced in
young CRs.
Aim 2: to determine if pre-fusion F VLP immunization of RSV primed, young CRs can result in
protective antibodies in elderly CR with or without a second VLP boost immunization.
Aim 3: to assess if VLP induced protective responses in elderly CRs can be further augmented by
adjusted doses of VLPs, route of immunization, or addition of adjuvants."
10795019,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The cornea is the most highly innervated structure in the body, supplied by the ophthalmic branch of the
trigeminal nerve. As part of the peripheral nervous system, corneal nerves respond to pain, temperature,
mechanical and chemical stimuli. They also secrete various trophic and growth factors, which are essential to
the health and function of the cornea. However, corneal nerves are highly susceptible to injury through various
mechanisms that include trauma, infections, metabolic imbalances, and therapeutic interventions such as
refractive surgeries. Once injured, they fail to reestablish their baseline density or morphology, contributing to
corneal dysfunction. Currently, there are no targeted treatments specific for corneal nerve regeneration. The
long-term goal of this proposal is to develop therapies for corneal nerve regeneration. The objective is to
determine key molecular mechanisms involved in corneal nerve regeneration to help inform new experimental
and therapeutic interventions. The central hypothesis is the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), a type of
glutamate receptor, help restore corneal nerve density and morphology, and therefore, corneal function. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that NMDARs have been shown to enhance nerve regeneration in other
analogous peripheral nervous systems. However, their role in corneal nerve regeneration remains unknown.
Additional justification for investigating the role of NMDARs in corneal nerve regeneration is based on other
published findings: 1) NMDARs are expressed throughout the nervous system, including the trigeminal nerves;
2) they have been shown to regulate neuronal maintenance and plasticity; 3) they regulate Schwann cell activity,
which are supporting cells essential to nerve regeneration; and 4) NMDARs cooperate with other signaling
molecules that have been shown to regulate corneal nerve regeneration such as LDL-receptor-related protein-1
and Ephrin type-B receptor 2. Therefore, we propose three aims to support our hypothesis. AIM 1 will determine
the role of NMDAR in corneal nerve maintenance and regeneration by conditionally deleting NMDAR in sensory
nerves and Schwann cells independently. AIM 2 will determine the effect of modulating NMDAR levels on corneal
nerve regeneration. AIM 3 will determine key downstream effectors, including the EphB2-Sox2 axis, with spatial
transcriptomics, correlated with protein levels and morphologic changes during corneal nerve regeneration. We
will pursue these aims using innovative genetic mouse models, intravital imaging, and spatial genomics. The
proposed aims are significant because they will define new molecular pathways that will inform the development
of future therapies. The immediate expected outcome of this work is rigorous interrogation of key pathways in
corneal nerve regeneration in vivo and contribution to our fundamental understanding of peripheral nerve
regeneration. The results will have an important direct positive impact because they will interrogate new
experimental approaches and inform the development of targeted therapies for corneal nerve regeneration."
10795641,"A growing body of research has now demonstrated that inhibitors targeting bromodomain and extra-terminal
domain (BET) proteins, which mediate mRNA transcription, have anti-tumor effects against pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). BET inhibitors can also normalize the PDAC stroma by suppressing the activation of
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). However, BET inhibitors induce Rac1-mediated activation of MNK
kinases, which mediate mRNA translation. Importantly, targeting MNK kinases and the MNK effector hnRNPA1
enhances the efficacy of BET inhibitors. Significantly, MNK inhibitors induce CD8+ T cell infiltration, but their
effector function is suppressed by the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Notably, BET inhibitors can
decrease the infiltration of TAMs. The objective in this application is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the
combination of BET and MNK inhibitors demonstrates anti-tumor responses against PDAC. The central
hypothesis is that the combination effectively targets the cancer cells, modulates the tumor immune
microenvironment, and normalizes the pancreatic stroma to suppress PDAC growth. Three specific aims are
proposed: 1) Define and target negative feedback loops to enhance the anti-tumor effects of BET inhibitors in
vivo; 2) Evaluate the effects of the combination of BET and MNK inhibitors on CD8+ T cell infiltration and
activation; 3) Determine the effects of the combination of BET and MNK inhibitors on the pancreatic stroma.
Under the first aim, the mechanisms by which MNK effectors hnRNPA1 and CYFIP1, which can function
downstream of Rac1, limit the efficacy of BET inhibitors will be evaluated. Further, the efficacy of co-treatment
with BET and MNK inhibitors will be evaluated in organoid and transgenic mouse models of PDAC. For the
second aim, the effects of the combination therapy on CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation and macrophage
abundance and polarization will be evaluated. In addition, the contribution of MNK kinases and the MNK effectors
hnRNPA1 and CYFIP1 in macrophages to limiting the efficacy of BET inhibitors will be evaluated. In the third
aim, the effects of the combination therapy on the stromal reaction will be characterized in the transgenic mouse
model. The contribution of MNK kinases, CYFIP1, and hnRNPA1 in pancreatic CAFs to limiting the efficacy of
BET inhibitors will also be evaluated. In addition, the relationship between BET and MNK kinase activity, MNK
effectors, and stromal reaction will be evaluated in human PDAC tumor specimens. There are several innovative
elements in this proposal, including the novel therapeutic approach to enhance anti-tumor responses in PDAC
patients; novel concepts on how the combination therapy of BET and MNK inhibitors modulates the tumor
immune microenvironment and the stromal reaction for synergistic anti-tumor responses; and the unique
combination of complex models of PDAC, including in vivo orthotopic, organoid, and transgenic mouse models.
This proposed research is significant because it will have important clinical-translational implications and should
result in the development of novel combination therapies for PDAC patients."
10800092,"We propose to study extracellular vesicles (EVs) as novel mediators of the pathogenesis of radiation cystitis
(RC), which affects approximately 15% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with radiotherapy (RT).
Bladder radiotoxicity impacts the lives of PCa survivors, most notably older patients, and there are no
predictive markers associated with its incidence, nor are there durable molecular therapies capable of
preventing RC. There is an urgent need for the development of effective medical countermeasures against RC
and the identification of molecular diagnostics to aid in mitigating this debilitating treatment-related
complication. EVs are lipid-bound nanoparticles that mediate intercellular communication by delivering cargo
molecules to neighboring or distant cells. Studies have shown that RT induces EV release and alters the
composition of these EVs. However, most research to date has been conducted in cell lines, with limited
preclinical studies and no human research. Using preserved samples collected from a genome-wide
association study (GWAS), we reported for the first time a link between urinary EV (uEV) levels and the future
onset of hematuria, providing a promising biomarker that may enable more timely treatment of at-risk patients
to mitigate the development of late bladder toxicities. The prognostic utility of EVs in serum was less robust.
This is further supported by an animal study showing a correlation of uEV particle counts with RT-induced
bladder toxicity. Critically, post-RT uEVs derived from PCa patients who developed late hematuria induced
substantial oxidative stress in normal bladder recipient cells, further supporting a functional link between EVs
and radiotoxicity. Proteomic analyses of 12 uEV samples revealed that those EV cargo proteins were
profoundly altered by RT. Notably, we identified 60 RT-toxicity signature uEV proteins including many with
functions associated with innate immunity and neutrophil activity, highlighting potential mechanism(s) of action.
Based on these studies, we hypothesize that RT induces the release of EVs and alters their composition, and
the resultant RT-EVs carry immunologically active biomolecules, thereby inducing additional cellular damage.
The kinetics of RT-EV release and RT-EV cargo molecules can serve as predictive biomarkers for RT-induced
toxicity that will allow for early intervention to mitigate RT toxicity. We propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To
define the roles of radiation-induced extracellular vesicles in mediating RT-induced bladder damage in vitro
and in vivo. Aim 2: Characterization of RT-EV cargo molecules and their roles in mediating radiotoxicity. Aim
3: To establish body fluid-derived EV-based predictive biomarkers for RT-induced toxicity. Accomplishing the
proposed studies will define the functional roles of RT-EVs as mediators of RT toxicity. RT-induced EV release
kinetics and alterations in EV cargos will represent sensitive, noninvasive urine/blood-based EV biomarkers
that can predict clinically relevant RT outcomes before the onset of late toxicities."
10800095,"Our central hypothesis is that targeting regulatory genes of cancer progression will impede tumor growth and
prevent disease recurrence. Our study goals are two-fold: to discover cancer regulatory genes with HER2/Neu-
expressing Diversity Outbred (DO) F1 mice; and to test intervention strategies directed at actionable targets such
as LILRB4, a myeloid antigen-presenting cell (APC) checkpoint molecule. The development of spontaneous
mammary tumors in HER2/neu-transgenic mice captures the substantial interactions among tumor, stromal, and
immune cells, and provides a translational research platform. We will use (BALBxDO)F1 NeuT mice and
(FVBxDO)F1 d16HER2 mice to encompass the complete biological process of HER2/Neu-induced tumor in mice
of individually distinct genetic background. The R-based R/QTL algorithm associates tumor growth phenotypes
with each mouse’s unique haplotype to reveal Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). Candidate genes in the QTL are
identified with our bioinformatics pipeline and vetted with human clinical outcome data. Actionable targets are
selected by integrating scRNA transcriptomic findings with functional pathway analysis.
 LILRB4 emerged from the panel of candidate molecules because it is expressed by myeloid antigen
presenting cells (APC) and is correlated with poorer survival in human breast and lung cancer patients. Antigen
presentation is the foundation of immune activation and an under-utilized opportunity for modifying anti-tumor
immunity. LILRB4 activation blunts the antigen presentation machinery and signals the production of immune
suppressive molecules. LILRB4 blockade may restore or enhances myeloid cell antigen presentation to prime
and expand T cells, unlocking their anti-tumor activity.
 To test our hypothesis of targeting cancer regulatory genes for disease control, we will
Aim 1 Identify candidate genes that regulate cancer progression
1A Identify and validate QTL that regulate tumor onset age and growth rate in (FVBxDO)F1 d16HER2 mice
1B Identify and vet candidate genes in each QTL using the established bioinformatics pipeline
Aim 2 Define candidate gene expression profiles and select actionable targets
2A Deconvolute gene expression profiles in mouse mammary fat pads by scRNA-Seq
2B Identify actionable target genes by integrating gene expression profiles with functional pathway analysis
2C Associate enhancer accessibility with differential gene expression to capture additional candidate genes
Aim 3 Test the hypothesis that LILRB4 blockade will expand tumor immunity to impede tumor growth
3A Evaluate the role of LILRB4 in tumor immunity by genetic knockout or antibody blockade
3B Test anti-tumor immune activation by combining LILRB4 blockade with a-HER2 mAb therapy or active
vaccination"
10797009,"RAS mutations drive a large proportion of deadly human tumors but no targeted therapies have
advanced to clinic. We and others have shown that certain oncogenic RAS mutations have unique
biochemical properties and have shown that functional classes of RAS mutations are differentially regulated,
opening the door to RAS allele-tailored treatment approaches. RAS allele-specific therapies have the potential
for rapid clinical translation and would be worthwhile because (1) RAS mutation status is already routinely
assessed in current clinical practice for multiple common cancers, (2) potent and selective small molecules
targeting members of RAS signaling pathways, or regulators of those members are already available, and (3)
RAS mutations occur frequently enough in cancer that a significant number of patients would benefit even
though therapies apply to subsets of RAS mutation-positive tumors. This proposal seeks to develop direct and
indirect therapeutic strategies based on the unique mode of activation and resultant signaling properties of
KRAS A146T and other RAS exchange mutants. This study has translational therapy implications given that
KRAS A146T is already screened for in clinical practice, but no targeted therapies currently exist."

 This is a renewal of NIH grant DK031036, the original grant to the Kahn lab, which is now in its 38th year
and was granted MERIT status at the last renewal. Since inception, this grant has focused on the insulin and
IGF-1 receptors, their signaling pathways and their alterations in physiologic and pathologic states. Over the
past decade, we have made tremendous progress in understanding the signaling and biological roles of these
receptors through both in vitro and in vivo studies. These include extensive studies using gene targeting to
create single and combinatorial knockouts of insulin and IGF-1 receptors (IR and IGF1R); combinatorial
knockouts IR with post-receptors effectors of insulin action (IRS and FoxO proteins); and tissue-specific and
inducible knockouts to determine the role of IR and IGF1R in individual tissues in normal physiology and the
pathophysiology of diabetes. In addition, in vitro we have defined differential signaling by insulin and IGF-1
receptors, and unique actions of insulin and IGF-1 in different cell types. As a result, since the last competitive
renewal, this grant has provided support for 88 published papers which have led to new insights into the
complex nature of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling network, the contribution of insulin resistance in different organs
to diabetes and metabolic syndrome, as well as evidence on how tissues communicate with one another in
insulin resistant states. In addition, we have made novel observations regarding the role of insulin action in
non-classical target tissues, like the brain, intestine, endothelial and iPS cells; the presence of novel insulin-like
peptides in viruses, and potential for signaling by unoccupied IR and IGF1R. During the coming grant period,
our aims are to continue to expand our understanding of insulin/IGF1 action by 1) defining the differential roles
of the extra- and intra-cellular domains of IR and IGF1R in signaling in vitro and in vivo using three
complementary strategies [mass spectroscopy based phosphoproteomic analysis of insulin/IGF-1 receptor
mutants and chimeric receptors in vitro; creation of a new generation of knock-in mouse models in which IR is
replaced by IGF1R, by chimeric insulin/IGF-1 receptors or by substitutions in the juxtamembrane domain of the
receptor important in differences in IR vs IGF1R signaling, and use of newly discovered viral insulin-like
peptides (VILPs) to explore differences in IR/IGF1R signaling]; 2) determine the nature of signaling by the
unoccupied insulin and IGF-1 receptors involved in control of gene expression, autophagy and apoptosis and
identify the domains of the receptors mediating these effects and the signaling proteins that interact with them
and 3) continuing to define the role of insulin signaling in brain on astrocytes vs neurons using global and
region-specific IR knockouts; insulin regulation of gene expression and metabolite levels in brain; and the
interaction of insulin resistance in brain with genetic risks in pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease. Together
these studies will continue to help unravel new aspects in the mechanisms of insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling
and their alterations in diabetes, metabolic and neurodegenerative disease."
10795201,"ABSTRACT: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a progressive, female-predominant, cystic lung disease
caused by mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex genes. In a recent phase 3 trial, treatment with sirolimus
was shown to stabilize lung function (FEV1) decline and improve quality of life in patients with LAM. However,
treatment with sirolimus is suppressive rather than remission inducing and doesn’t work for everyone,
highlighting the need to develop new therapies in LAM. Pivotal trials of such therapies must overcome the ceiling
effect of FEV1, as sirolimus-containing combination regimens are compared with sirolimus alone. For these trials
to be successful, two critical needs must be met: 1) the development of a cohort enrichment strategy to identify
patients at risk for progression and suboptimal treatment response; and 2) the identification of a sensitive clinical
outcome assessment (COA) for use as an endpoint.
 There is wide inter-individual variability in disease progression and response to sirolimus in patients with
LAM. Developing a modeling-based prediction system that make accurate, dynamic predictions of future FEV1
can aid individualized prognostication, foster timely therapeutic decision-making, and identify patients at greatest
risk for progression or suboptimal treatment response to enrich future trial cohorts. Given the relative stability of
lung function on sirolimus, FEV1 decline is unlikely to be a practical primary endpoint in future LAM trials. We
submit that a reliable, valid, responsive, LAM-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that assesses
symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is likely to be the most meaningful COA to meet this need.
 The Multicenter International Durability and Safety of Sirolimus in LAM (MIDAS) Registry contains
longitudinal physiological and patient-reported HRQOL data on ~400 LAM patients with an average length of
follow up of ~4 years. We postulate that: 1) by employing novel stochastic modeling we can accurately identify
impending FEV1 decline in untreated patients with LAM and predict the likelihood of response to treatment in
patients on sirolimus, and 2) successful validation of a LAM-specific PROM that captures clinically meaningful
outcomes will result in the development of a high-tier novel endpoint for future therapeutic trials in LAM.
 To test our hypotheses, we will use the MIDAS data to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Characterize
heterogeneous treatment effects and develop a data-driven approach to optimize treatment initiation in patients
with LAM, and 2) Validate the use of a LAM-specific PROM to identify clinically meaningful outcomes. Successful
completion of Aim 1 will facilitate optimal treatment decisions and provide a mechanism for cohort enrichment in
LAM trials. Successful completion of Aim 2 will yield systematic analysis of a LAM-specific PROM’s measurement
properties and support its reliability, validity, and responsiveness for capturing patient-centered outcomes. This
project is highly significant as it will usher in a new era of personalized medicine by providing precise prognostic
predictions and facilitate the design of rapid, efficient, and adequately powered, patient-centered trials in LAM."
10795434,"Imaging plays an increasingly important role in studying development and complex tissue formation across
molecular, cellular and tissue levels. Fluorescence 3D time-lapse imaging allows every cell in a tissue or entire
organism to be imaged, tracked and measured over hours and days to analyze lineage differentiation and
dynamic cell behaviors. Other modalities, e.g., electron and expansion microscopy reveal fine structural
phenomena, while emerging genomics technologies, e.g., spatial transcriptomics, seek to merge with
microscopy to further provide systematic molecular information. Effective tools of image analysis are crucial to
extract, integrate and interpret the information. We propose to leverage the power of deep learning to develop
image analysis tools for systematic in vivo single-cell analysis, and to leverage such analysis to study collective
cell behaviors in tissue morphogenesis, with three Aims. First, we will develop deep learning methods for
accurate cell tracking, which is the essential first step to trace cell lineages and measure dynamic cell
behaviors. We aim to produce a tool that can deliver substantial cell lineages with hundreds to thousands of
cells imaged over hours to days in a wide range of model organisms and organoid cultures. Second, we will
automate landmark-based image registration, which is crucial for cross-modality data integration. We propose
a generalizable approach that uses statistical templates and Neural Networks to address the unique challenge
in developmental images, namely heterochrony of developmental processes that creates combinatorial
configurations of landmarks and complex systematic co-variance. Third, we study a novel Planar Cell Polarity
(PCP) scheme in C. elegans, which we discovered through cell tracking and deep learning of cell movement
patterns. By dissecting the compound polarity scheme and context specific regulators, we aim to understand
how the conserved core PCP pathway can coordinate with different polarity pathways in order to orchestrate
diverse motile behaviors in diverse developmental processes. By integrating technology development and
hypothesis driven research, our proposal will further our understanding of embryogenesis and complex tissue
formation."

Leveraging decades of NCI investments in clinical trials, data infrastructure, and cancer screening research, the
I-SCREEN (Improving Strategies for Cancer Reduction through Early-detection and ENgagement) ACCESS Hub
is well-positioned to efficiently and effectively address pressing issues around the emergence of new
technologies for cancer screening. These include evaluating the benefits and harms of new cancer screening
technologies and their impacts on cancer-related health disparities. We will build on the University of Colorado
Cancer Center's (UCCC) successful administration of large cancer screening trials, including the Prostate, Lung,
Ovarian, & Colorectal (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), along with
their well-established Colorado Cancer Screening Program (CCSP), a statewide cancer screening network
reaching under-resourced communities. UCCC's network of rural health centers will be complemented by Kaiser
Permanente Colorado's (KPCO) inclusion of Hispanic members from Colorado's Front Range and extend
existing collaborations between UCCC and KPCO in the NCI-funded Colorado Implementation Science Center
for Cancer Control (COISC3). We will also build on the synergy between KPCO and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii
(KPHI) as the only two sites in NCI's Population-based Research to Optimize the Screen Process (PROSPR)
Consortium that are also part of the Connect NCI Cohort Initiative and the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Research
Bank (KP's national biobank), both recruiting healthy patients and collecting blood biospecimens. The I-SCREEN
Consortium consists of an NCI-designated Cancer Center, two integrated care delivery systems, one federally
qualified health system, and one rural critical access hospital system. I-SCREEN will recruit some of the most
under-represented populations in clinical trials, including Hispanics, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (NH/PI),
Asian subgroups, and rural populations. Our long-term goal is to reduce cancer-related mortality by rapidly
investigating emerging, novel screening technologies in diverse study cohorts to ensure that efficacious new
technologies have a broad reach to help decrease, and not widen, cancer-related health disparities. To
accomplish this goal, we will: 1) collaborate with NCI, the CSRN Centers and ACCESS Hubs to build an
ecosystem to evaluate new cancer screening technologies and strategies in diverse clinical settings; 2) Develop
and
screening
execute the Vanguard feasibility study to inform the design of trials to evaluate new technologies for cancer
in under-represented populations; and, 3)increase the impact of CSRN by collaborating with NCI to
build a robust data/biospecimen repository available to CSRN investigators and external investigators. Through
centralized Administrative, Recruitment and Biospecimens, Engagement, and Data Cores, we will ensure
ACCESS Hub collaboration, communication, and progress towards CSRN deliverables. I-SCREEN will be a
model for high-impact, translational research to test emerging cancer screening technologies and reduce
disparities in cancer mortality."

 Genomic variants in an individual may be either inherited (i.e., transmitted through the germline) or
generated by mutagenesis in post-zygotic cells, which results in no two cells in any individual having the same
genome. Clonal hematopoiesis is the phenomenon of age-related outgrowth of somatic clones in the blood. Such
an outgrowth has been associated with increased all-cause mortality, risk of blood cancer and cardiovascular
diseases but reduced risks of Alzheimer’s disease. In the proposed project we will discover and analyze somatic
CNVs using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in the All of Us cohort. We will apply CNVpytor to all All of
Us WGS data to discover somatic CNVs and provide discovered CNVs as a resource to researchers in the All
of Us Researcher Workbench. The resource will include a tiered list of CNVs, processed and small sized files
for instant manual inspection of CNVs, and documentation and video tutorial with examples how to access,
inspect, analyze and visualize the discovered CNVs in IGV. Additionally, we will include stratification of CNV
types (i.e., deletions, duplications, LOHs) by age, defining their likely age of occurrence, determining their precise
breakpoints, and analyzing sequences at the breakpoints to reveal their likely origin. Completing the described
project will result in a large-scale assessment of somatic CNVs in the blood of individuals in the All of Us cohort
and will provide a new insight into the etiology of such somatic CNVs. The developed methodologies can be
applied to data generated in the future, as All of Us expands the collection of samples.

More than 2 billion people are projected to be overweight and 1 billion to be obese by 2030. In addition to its
specific co-morbidities, obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic diseases and cancer. Emerging approaches
utilizing brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and thermogenesis have the potential to be safe, effective,
sustainable, and affordable for treating obesity-related metabolic diseases. However, currently imaging methods
for BAT metabolic function have limitations. Recent studies found, through the futile creatine cycling, creatine
promotes adrenergic activation of BAT and thermogenesis in a manner that is independent of mitochondrial
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). We have made breakthroughs in extracting the molecular Chemical exchange
saturation transfer (CEST) contrasts from high-resolution Z-spectral imaging of adipose tissues, particularly the
creatine CEST (CrCEST) as an endogenous and clinically translatable MRI. Our preliminary animal studies
demonstrated that dynamic CrCEST MRI detected significant BAT adrenergic activation in response to a β3-AR
agonist CL-316243 (CL). Our central hypothesis is that endogenous CrCEST MRI measures metabolic function
of adipose tissues through adipocyte creatine, the mediator of adrenergic activation. Aim 1. To investigate the
molecular origin of CrCEST MRI for BAT metabolic function, including characterizing the percentage contribution
of creatine to CrCEST and the longitudinal repeatability with and without respiratory gating. Aim 2. To validate
CrCEST MRI for the assessment of BAT metabolism in genetically modified mice. We will develop fast dynamic
CrCEST MRI based on key-hole technique. We will assess the metabolic balance of UCP1-KO mice through
futile creatine cycling. Mice will receive daily saline, Cr supplement, or β-GPA (a Cr kinase inhibitor) for 2 weeks,
while dynamic CrCEST MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT will be performed with biopathological measurements in the
end for validation. We expect, Cr supplement will boost the adrenergic activation of BAT in UCP1-KO mice while
β-GPA blunt the adrenergic activation. Similarly, we will study adipose-specific Cr transporter knockout (CrTKO)
mice and expect that CrTKO impairs adrenergic activation in BAT and disable the effect of Cr supplement. Aim
3. To evaluate longitudinal Z-spectral MRI for monitoring BAT activation and WAT beiging during the prevention
or treatment of obesity. In the prevention study, young mice on high-fat diet (HFD) will receive saline, Cr
supplement, mirabegron (a β3-AR agonist), or the combination in the diet for 8 weeks and be monitored every
two weeks with Z-spectral MRI producing CrCEST and amide proton transfer effect. In the treatment study,
obese mice will be treated similarly and monitored for 8 weeks followed with biopathological measurements. The
successful development and validation of CrCEST MRI in adipose tissues will provide 1) real-time non-invasive
functional imaging of adipose tissues; 2) a better understanding of creatine in BAT adrenergic activation and
white-fat browning, and its potential for preventing and treating metabolic diseases."
10797304,"ABSTRACT
Endometrial cancer is the 4th most common cancer diagnosed and 6th leading cause of cancer death among
United States (U.S.) women. Today, there are more than 891,000 endometrial cancer survivors in the U.S.,
making it the second largest cancer survivor group among women (after breast). Black women are more likely
than White women to have endometrial cancer recur and are twice as likely to die. Disparities in endometrial
cancer outcomes are multifactorial; contributors likely include, but are not limited to, an inequitable distribution
of worse-prognosis biologic subtypes, variation in symptom recognition and receipt of guideline-concordant
cancer treatment, and differential survivorship care. We propose a comprehensive approach to understand
underlying racial disparities in outcomes within a population-based endometrial cancer survivorship cohort. The
Carolina Endometrial Cancer Study (CECS) will prospectively recruit women with newly-diagnosed endometrial
cancer in North Carolina using the statewide Central Cancer Registry’s rapid case ascertainment program.
Black women will be oversampled by design in order to enroll ~667 Black women within the planned cohort of
~1,700 women. Baseline data collection includes retrieval of tumor paraffin blocks and medical records for
detailed diagnostic and treatment history, collection of buccal samples, and administration of questionnaires
offered in written, phone, or online formats. We will conduct follow-up interviews every 18 months and retrieve
medical records for any additional endometrial cancer treatment or reported disease recurrence. Our aims
include: 1) To assess variation in the distribution of endometrial cancer histologic and molecular subtypes that
are associated with poor prognosis among Black and White women evaluated by centralized pathology review;
2) To assess variation in presenting symptoms and receipt of guideline-concordant endometrial cancer
treatment among Black and White women and; 3) To assess variation in experience and provider assessment
of guideline-recommended symptoms for surveillance visits and survivorship care among Black and White
women. The proposed cancer epidemiology survivorship cohort uses a population-based platform and
combines detailed tumor biology and patient-reported survey data to investigate endometrial cancer biology,
medical care, and experience. We collect detailed information on individual-level molecular tumor
characteristics; behavioral and lifestyle factors; cancer treatment, follow-up care, and recurrence information
abstracted from medical records; and have an established infrastructure to link participant records to
administrative insurance claims and area-level social determinants of health and health system factors. The
multidisciplinary investigative team and patient advocacy support facilitate investigation of not only the
proposed aims, but create a resource and infrastructure for ongoing research to advance the science of
endometrial cancer survivorship."
10797603,"In head and neck cancer (HNC) and many other solid tumor types immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
approaches are effective in just a subset of patients (e.g. 15-20%). Our in-depth analysis of multiple smoking-
related malignancies has revealed that tumor derived factors, both genetic and metabolic, may be far more
important in dictating a permissive tumor immune microenviroment (TIME) than previously appreciated. As
we continue to move forward with a plethora of new clinical trials trying different regimens of ICIs layered
upon standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation we may very well be missing the mark by not
considering more strongly the genomic background and individual cancer biology underpinning the very
tumors being treated. We believe the next revolution in immune-oncology is more likely to stem from
combination therapy that directly targets the hidden biology of tumors that makes them dodge the immune
system rather than discovery of yet another ICI molecule. Specifically, we have accumulated a large body of
evidence that points to Nrf2 pathway activation as a major driver of cancer biology and immune escape. This
pathway in the context of immune checkpoints holds great theranostic promise for improving ICI outcomes
and at the same time for overcoming resistance to orthogonal standard of care chemotherapy and radiation.
 Here we will link tobacco exposure and Nrf2 across the biological spectrum of HNC by measuring the
temporal kinetics of tobacco exposure effects on Nrf2 activation in HNC (Subaim 1.1). Using a layered
approach we will measure the level of Nrf2 activation following chronic tobacco exposure and identify
downstream drivers of survival to oxidative stress generated by tobacco exposure in selected cell lines
(Subaim 1.2). Using established immunodeficient murine models of HNC we will then link tobacco exposure
to Nrf2 activation in vivo (Subaim 1.3) and demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of Nrf2 can reduce
tobacco exposure effects on downstream gene activation. In Aim 2 we will define the mechanisms by which
Nrf2 activation regulates TIME. We previously identified one key Nrf2 target, Gpx2 as a driver of a suppressive
TIME using human data and murine models of HNC. We will measure immune effects of acute and chronic
tobacco exposure as a function of Nrf2 activation and Gpx2 activity (Subaim 2.1) in vitro and using
immunocompetent HNC murine models as it relates to functional immunocytes (CD8+ T cells) and suppressor
MDSCs (Subaim 2.2). Finally, we will define the impact of tobacco induced Nrf2 activation on immune
checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness in HNC. We will measure the impact of chronic smoke induced Nrf2
activation on ICI effectiveness in immunocompetent HNC models (Subaim 3.1) and test whether either direct
reversal of Nrf2 activity (ML385) or indirect inhibition of downstream effects via the glutaminase-1 (GLS1)
inhibitor IACS6274 can restore maximal ICI effectiveness in against HNC tumors (Subaim 3.2)."
10805522,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Oral and oropharyngeal cancers result in over 10,000 deaths each year in the United States. Although
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients with localized disease have survival rates of up to 80%, about
two-thirds present clinically with regional and distant metastases associated with five-year survival rates of 50%
and 35%, respectively. Despite advances in immunotherapy, the five-year mortality rate for OSCC has remained
constant over the last several decades, underscoring the importance of early detection and intervention.
 The majority of OSCCs arise from pre-cancerous lesions called oral epithelial dysplasias (OED), only
some of which will progress to invasive cancers. Patients with OEDs that will progress would likely benefit from
more aggressive treatment early on; however, the morbidities associated with aggressive treatment are
significant, preventing their broad use in all patients. While this general outlook is similar across many cancers,
the accessibility of oral cavity lesions also provides a unique opportunity for detailed analysis to understand the
biological processes that contribute to or protect against progression into invasive and malignant cancer.
 We will test the hypothesis that the immune response to OED regulates the risk of progression.
The immune system responds to disruptions and danger in tissues. Significant evidence supports the important
role of the immune system in responding to early lesions in the oral cavity, including an abundance of immune
cells infiltrating these tissues, elevated risk in immunosuppressed individuals, and loss of MHC class I antigen
presentation machinery in many OSCC tumors. However, features of the immune response are not currently
utilized to define treatment strategies or to stratify risk in OED or OSCC patients, presenting an unmet
opportunity. The recent development of multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) enables unprecedented detailed
analysis of archival pathological tissues. This technology, which we recently implemented with the help of an
NIH Instrumentation Grant, uses antibodies conjugated to heavy-metal reporter ions to quantify up to 50 proteins
simultaneously at subcellular (400nm) resolution in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We have collated
a substantial number of archival tissues from OED patients with detailed clinical and follow up data, including
progression to OSCC. Here, we will leverage MIBI to conduct a detailed analysis of immune responses in these
tumors, providing new insight into the immunological mechanisms and cellular interactions in these
microenvironments. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the types of immune cells present and their
activation states are distinct between OEDs that went on to progress versus those that have not. In Aim 2, we
will test the hypothesis that the architecture and cellular neighborhoods within the tissue are distinct in OEDs
that progressed to OSCC. In Aim 3, we will use these data to identify immune features associated with and
predictive of risk of progression. These studies will harness a new imaging technique to answer fundamental
questions about the immune response and to guide precise treatment decisions for patients with OED."
10805527,"Abstract. Transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) is critically important for heart and vascular development
and repair. TGF-β2 dysregulation is seen in patient TGF-β2 mutations, systemic sclerosis, and Kawasaki
disease, which have cardiovascular sequelae such as aortic aneurysms and cardiac fibrosis. TGF-β1, 2 and 3
are synthesized as proproteins that dimerize and associate with milieu molecules that regulate TGF-β tissue
localization, such as the transmembrane protein glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) and latent
TGF-β binding proteins (LTBPs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Proconvertases cleave between the
prodomain and growth factor (GF) domain; however, the prodomain dimer remains non-covalently associated
with the GF in a proTGF-β–milieu molecule complex after secretion. ProTGF-β–milieu molecule complexes are
inactive because the prodomains encircle the GF and prevent binding to TGF-β receptors. ProTGF-β1 and 3
activation is mediated by binding of integrins αVβ6 and αVβ8 to an RGD-motif in the prodomain and requires
proTGF-β association with a milieu molecule. How proTGF-β2, which lacks an RGD-motif, is activated remains
a mystery. Aim 1 will define the structure of proTGF-β2 to understand its mechanism of latency. Aim 2 will
determine proTGF-β2/milieu molecule complex structures by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM to define how
milieu molecules bind and alter TGF-β2 latency. We will generate antibodies to use as crystallization
chaperones in addition to using already developed nanobodies to proTGF-β2. Complementary unfolding
studies will test the hypothesis that milieu molecule binding stabilizes proTGF-β2. Aim 3 characterizes TGF-β2
activation. Follow-up studies will identify cell-lines that natively activate TGF-β2 and characterize the
physiologically relevant process. The results of this grant will enhance our understanding of TGF-β2 latency
and activation in extracellular milieus and lay the foundation for developing therapeutics that target proTGF-β2
and its physiologically relevant complexes with milieu molecules."
10801167,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune disease which affects 2.5 million people in the US,
many of which are VA military personnel. One in four veterans has arthritis (25.6%), compared to one in five
civilians. RA is a chronic, disabling autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its tissues. As RA progresses,
performing simple daily activities becomes increasingly difficult for patients suffering from the disease. Presently,
there is no cure for RA and up to 50% of patients diagnosed with RA do not respond to current treatments or
lose their responsiveness over time. Findings that lead to new therapy will benefit the VA personnel by reducing
the cost of medical and surgical care; in addition to the secondary RA complications including depression,
cardiovascular disease, and psychosocial stress. Consequently, effective RA therapy will improve the pain & the
life quality of veterans.
The goal of this project is to identify novel therapeutic targets for patients that do not respond to current
treatments. As such, we have uncovered novel pathways that can markedly alleviate pannus formation by
disconnecting the unique networks interconnecting RA inflammatory macrophages to joint neovasculature via
metabolic reprogramming. Unlike the current RA standard of care, the mechanism of action is not limited to a
specific inflammatory factor and its function will impact multiple cell types in the RA pannus and their metabolic
crosstalk. We are proposing a unique way of negating RA pannus formation which has not been examined
previously.
Initially, we will examine the inflammatory & metabolic profiles of RA circulating blood and synovial tissue
macrophages in response to an identified endogenous factor to delineate if blockade of hypermetabolic activity
will reverse the inflammatory phenotype by RNA-sequencing and CyTOF. Next, the impact of the endogenous
factor will be determined on endothelial cell metabolic reprogramming and their cross-regulation with RA
macrophages by comparing cells in monoculture with the coculture condition employing isotype labeling of
carbon flux, mitochondria tracker, and real-time ATP assay. Last, we will utilize disaggregated or non-
disaggregated RA synovial tissues as well as those cultured in a 3D format to determine the effectiveness of
blocking the metabolic intermediates activated by the endogenous factor compared to anti-TNF and anti-IL-6R
antibodies through phenotyping the metabolic and oxidative signatures and analyzing the tubular formation. The
instigators and the mechanism by which glycolytic RA macrophages escalate vascularization & pannus formation
is unclear. Hence there is an unmet need to elucidate the mechanism by which endothelial cells adapt to RA
macrophage metabolic misfunction to promote pannus hyperplasia in VA patients. The outlined studies will
reconceptualize how disconnecting the shared network between RA macrophages and endothelial cells will
attenuate pannus in VA patients."
10801611,"Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are common during military conflict, and these exert significant adverse effects
on the health of service members involved in warfare. The onset of a GI disorder can be triggered by severe
stress and infections of the digestive tract. It is becoming more evident that high levels of anxiety that military
personnel face during war may contribute to the increased risk of developing GI disorders such as irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The GI tract is lined with a protective monolayer of
epithelial cells that separates the host from the hostile environment of the GI tract and increased intestinal
permeability has been linked to chronic GI symptoms in Gulf War veterans. The mucosal epithelial layer is
densely innervated by nerve fibers originating from the enteric nervous system (ENS), which is essential for GI
motility, ion secretion, fluid absorption, and epithelial barrier permeability. Unraveling the mechanisms of
epithelial and ENS interactions remains technically challenging, and much work remains to be done regarding
our understanding of how ENS influences intestinal epithelium. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a simple bioactive
phospholipid that exhibits numerous biological functions acting through six widely distributed G protein-coupled
receptors, LPA1-6. Our studies using mice with global loss of the LPA1 receptor have indicated a role for LPA1
signaling in intestinal epithelial barrier function and wound healing. Other have shown that the LPA1 receptor is
a critical mediator of neurological function so that the lack of LPA1 receptor leads to stress hypersensitivity,
anxious-depression phenotype, and dysregulation of pain perception. The proposed study is based on our
preliminary findings that mice lacking the LPA1 receptor in the ENS (Lpar1ΔENS) display dysregulated GI motility
and reduced numbers of enteric neurons and glial cells. Additionally, we observed that inhibition of the LPA1
receptor in enteric glial cells causes intestinal epithelial barrier defects. We hypothesize that LPA1 receptor
signaling in the ENS plays a role in the regulation of GI motility and intestinal barrier function and that the loss of
LPA1 function in the ENS leads to intestinal inflammation associated with increased levels of stress. We will use
established cell lines, primary cells, and novel mouse models to explore the role of LPA1 receptor in the
regulation of enteric neuron and EGC survival and intestinal motility (Aim 1). Aim 2 will examine the role of enteric
neuroglial LPA1 receptor in the regulation of epithelial barrier function. In Aim 3, we will study whether the loss
of LPA1 in the ENS increases the susceptibility of intestinal inflammation."
10801618,"Project Summary
 Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe, a leading cause of nosocomial
infection in the United States, and a significant problem for Veterans receiving care in Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) facilities. The disease state is most often preceded by disruption of the host microbiome in
response to antibiotic treatment and is characterized by mild to severe (and often recurrent) diarrhea. Left
untreated, C. difficile infection (CDI) can be life threatening with sequelae that include antibiotic-associated
pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and sepsis.
 CDI is dependent on the secretion of one or more AB-type toxins: toxin A (TcdA), toxin B (TcdB), and the
C. difficile transferase toxin (CDT, or binary toxin). While TcdA and TcdB are considered the primary virulence
factors, multiple studies suggest that CDT increases the severity of CDI. The increasing prevalence of CDT
containing clinical isolates and the potential for developing CDT as an effective vaccine antigen necessitate a
deeper understanding of the CDT mechanism of action.
 CDT consists of two proteins: a cell binding and pore-forming protein (CdtB) which guides the delivery of
an ADP-ribosyltransferase (CdtA) into the host cytosol. CdtA-mediated disruption of actin cytoskeletal structure
has been associated with the formation of microtubule protrusions that could play a role in C. difficile adherence
to the epithelium. CDT is also associated with the suppression of an otherwise protective eosinophil response,
although the mechanism for this function is unclear.
 The over-arching goal for this project is to provide the mechanistic foundation for understanding
the role of CDT function in pathogenesis and the tools to advance this knowledge into effective vaccine
development strategies. The first aim and step toward achieving this goal is to define the dynamics of toxin
production and C. difficile adherence in a mouse model of CDI. We are developing quantitative capture ELISA
assays that allow for the quantification of TcdA, TcdB, CdtA, and CdtB protein levels in stool. We will leverage
these assays to monitor toxin levels over the time course of murine infection. We will also leverage these
reagents for the generation of sensitive and specific toxin imaging reagents. This will allow us to visualize toxin
production over the length of the intestinal tract and ultimately identify the cell types affected in the context of
infection. The second aim is to define the role of CDT in the context of CDI pathogenesis. We will evaluate a
panel of defined and isogenic toxin deletion strains in a murine model of infection. We will examine hypotheses
from the published literature and our preliminary data, with a directed focus on the possible role of CDT in
promoting C. difficile adherence, inflammasome activation, and mucosal-associated invariant T cell activation.
We will focus on understanding the dynamic changes occurring in the early stages of infection and the potential
of synergistic activities with TcdA and TcdB."
10801020,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Poor maternal cardiovascular health (CVH: behaviors + factors) in the peri-pregnancy period contributes to poor
offspring CVH over the life course, especially in socially disadvantaged groups. Many interventions have targeted
maternal CVH behaviors during pregnancy, but to improve offspring outcomes, targeting maternal CVH during
preconception may be more effective due to critical early gestational events. However, preconception maternal
CVH is understudied because half of pregnancies are unplanned, and clinical care among individuals of
childbearing age is inconsistent. Pediatric clinical settings offer a novel access point for maternal preconception
CVH, since >60% of births annually are to mothers who already have children. Leveraging this access to inves-
tigate key timing and drivers of maternal-child CVH across the entire peri-pregnancy period (preconception,
pregnancy, and postpartum) could reveal opportunities to break intergenerational cycles of cardiovascular dis-
ease and related disparities. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies that optimize CVH from the beginning
of life. Our objective here is to characterize key timing and drivers of maternal-child CVH across peri-pregnancy
to inform future person-centered interventions. We will leverage our Young Hearts study of diverse children from
clinics across Chicago to enroll and follow mothers who are likely to have another pregnancy, as well as fa-
thers/co-parents and subsequent offspring, and study them from preconception through postpartum. Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that 1) preconception is a sensitive period for the impact of maternal CVH
on offspring CVH, 2) specific social and psychological factors shape maternal capacity, opportunity, and motiva-
tion for healthy lifestyle and CVH, and 3) parents and clinicians desire specific intervention strategies to optimize
maternal and child CVH. We will test our hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) Compare the contributions of
preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum maternal CVH to child outcomes; 2) Map the contributions of social
and psychological factors to maternal CVH; and 3) Determine parents’ and clinicians’ preferences for intervention
characteristics to optimize maternal-child CVH. We will analyze data from online surveys and electronic medical
records among ~650 families to address Aims 1 and 2, and we will interview ~40 mothers (twice), 20 fathers/co-
parents, and 30 clinicians to address Aims 2 and 3. We will then integrate quantitative and qualitative findings
into a theory-based logic model for change and guiding principles for intervention. Key innovations are a novel
approach to access preconception, pragmatic technology-enabled cohort design, and integration of health psy-
chology theory and person-centeredness in a refined mixed-methods approach. The outcomes of this research
on when to intervene, what to intervene on, and how to intervene will help direct public health resources and will
provide a strong evidence base to develop novel interventions that promote optimal maternal-child CVH in di-
verse psychosocial contexts. The proposed project will thus enable significant progress toward eliminating ma-
ternal-child health disparities and launching future generations of children with optimal CVH."
10801023,"ABSTRACT
The number of overdose deaths caused by stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine has increased at an
alarming rate over the last decade. Yet, unlike other addictive substances, such as alcohol, nicotine, and opioids,
there are currently no FDA-approved medications for stimulant use disorders, leaving millions of Americans
without an effective therapeutic treatment. Growing evidence indicates that the α3β4 subtype of the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an integral role in drug addiction and that selective inhibition of these
receptors reduces the addictive properties of cocaine, methamphetamine, and other drugs of abuse. However,
existing classes of α3β4 nAChR antagonists suffer from poor selectivity, are not brain-penetrant, or induce partial
activation of the receptor, which hinder their clinical development. The objective of this proposal is to develop a
novel class of α3β4-selective nAChR negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) based on the alkaloid aristoquinoline
and demonstrate their effects in animal models of cocaine use disorder. Preliminary data generated in our lab
indicate that aristoquinoline and its derivatives potently and selectively inhibit α3β4 nAChR activation and
significantly reduce drug-seeking behavior in an animal model of cocaine relapse. The proposed studies will
build upon these results by testing the central hypothesis that α3β4 nAChRs NAMs based on the aristoquinoline
scaffold can safely and effectively reduce the addictive properties of cocaine. Aim 1 will optimize the α3β4
potency and selectivity of aristoquinoline by generating a collection of rationally designed derivatives and
evaluating their affinity and functional activity. Aim 2 will locate the aristoquinoline allosteric binding site, define
the mechanism of action, and identify off-target liabilities. Aim 3 will translate these results in vivo by prioritizing
lead compounds with optimized drug-like properties and advancing them into preclinical safety studies and
efficacy models of cocaine self-administration and relapse. This research is innovative, as it seeks to address
and overcome the limitations of existing α3β4 antagonists by investigating an understudied class of nAChR
ligands with a unique mechanism of action. The results from these studies will be significant because they will
produce the ideal pharmacological probe for investigating the function α3β4 nAChRs in vivo and deliver
promising drug leads for the treatment of cocaine use disorder."

Metastasis is a significant cause of mortality for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), with a median
overall survival of less than one year. The introduction of immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic
treatment of metastatic cancer. However, there are underlying resistance mechanisms that limit response to
immunotherapy in TNBCs. Increased PD-L1 cell surface expression is associated with improved response to α-
PD-L1 or α-PD-1 therapies. One potential mechanism by which tumor cells acquire resistance to immunotherapy
is by reducing PD-L1 expression in the cell membrane. Furthermore, recent reports have demonstrated that
internalized (non-membranous) PD-L1 participates in oncogenic/pro-metastatic signaling within cancer cells
without much mechanistic understanding. It is known that lipid metabolism and signaling alterations play a role
in cancer cell migration/invasion and tumor metastasis, including reductions of bioactive sphingolipid ceramide
that mediates pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative signaling. We recently showed that reductions in ceramide
synthase 4 (CerS4)-generated long-chain C18-C20-ceramides induce TNBC migration and metastasis by
activating the TGF-β/Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling axis. However, the regulatory components of this
mechanism remain unknown. Based on our published and unpublished preliminary data, this application is
designed to test a novel overall hypothesis that the reduction of CerS4-generated ceramide signaling enhances
PD-L1 internalization, induces pro-metastatic signaling and facilitates resistance to immunotherapy in
TNBC. There are two Specific Aims proposed: Aim 1 is designed to define the mechanism by which reduced
CerS4/ceramide signaling regulates PD-L1 internalization and its intracellular metastatic signaling. Aim 2 is
designed to determine how CerS4/ceramide signaling regulates the PD-L1/Caprin-1 complex to control TNBC
metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy. Overall, this application describes a novel resistance mechanism
to immunotherapy and intracellular PD-L1-dependent pro-metastatic signaling driven by lipid/ceramide
metabolism alterations. Combination therapies targeting this signaling network could reduce the metastatic
burden and improve metastatic TNBC response to immunotherapy, collectively addressing clinically unmet
needs in this application."
10801497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) has been decreasing, the
COVID-19 pandemic may have halted or reversed that trend. This project will quantify the effects of the
pandemic and of attendant public health and social measures on the cognitive status, mortality, and well-being
of persons living with ADRD and of the older population in general. Persons living with dementia were
especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because many were living in nursing homes, and even those residing in the
community were disproportionately vulnerable because of caregivers coming to their homes. Further, those
initially not living with dementia may have experienced accelerated cognitive decline because of COVID-19
infections, as well as due to disruption of daily routines, social isolation and stress. Subpopulations by race,
ethnicity and socioeconomic status were impacted unequally.
 This project has three specific aims. The first is to use a new and updated model of cognition to estimate
trends in ADRD prevalence, incidence, and mortality prior to the pandemic. We will use data from the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS), a large, nationally representative, longitudinal survey of the U.S. population over
age 50. The HRS has a wide range of information on cognitive abilities, mortality, dementia risks, and physical
and mental health, but only a subsample of the HRS from the Aging, Demographic, and Memory Study
(ADAMS) has a clinical assessment of dementia. In prior research, we used ADAMS to develop a model of the
probability of dementia to estimate the cognitive status of the entire HRS sample. In this work, we will expand
this model to estimate dementia incidence and mortality as well, and incorporate recently released data from
the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol, further increasing precision so as to permit the study of
changes in ADRD resulting from the pandemic in subpopulations, such as race and ethnicity, marital status,
and socioeconomic status.
 Second, we will document changes associated with the pandemic in mortality, well-being, use of formal
and informal care, and other outcomes. We will incorporate variation in state policies to assess their effect on
individual outcomes. We will compare these effects among those who were living with dementia prior to the
pandemic to those whose cognitive function was normal. We will use innovative models and data from various
HRS supplements focusing on COVID-19 to estimate these effects with precision.
 Third, we will estimate the incidence of dementia and dementia mortality after the pandemic through 2026
and find the extent to which COVID-19 altered pre-pandemic trends. We will assess whether ADRD incidence
differed by individual characteristics, such as geographic location, race, socioeconomic status, and living
arrangements. The developed cognition measures will be made publicly available to enhance future research."

 The heart combines several cell types and lineages to form a functional unit. The pericardium forms the
pericardial cavity and outer-most epithelial layers around the heart. Often regarded as mere heart-surrounding
mesothelium, the highly specialized pericardium provides mechanical support to the heart, sustains heart
muscle and coronary vessel growth, coordinates the response to inflammation, and supports myocardial
remodeling upon injury. Pericardial defects remain underdiagnosed and result in severe complications upon
heart or lung surgery. Decoding the mechanisms of pericardium formation is critical to understanding
congenital heart anomalies and improve regenerative approaches for heart injury and post-surgical healing.
What developmental mechanisms endow the pericardium with its unique properties, how it controls its dynamic
interaction with the heart, and how we can harness its plasticity in therapeutic settings, remain understudied.
Studying pericardium formation has remained challenging due to missing means to visualize, track, and isolate
earliest embryonic cells leading to its development.
 The goal of our research proposal is to uncover the mechanisms that drive pericardium development
in coordination with the heart from lateral plate mesoderm (LPM); we will combine our unique in vivo tools
in zebrafish for in toto live imaging, lineage tracing, enhancer discovery, and single cell-based transcriptome
analysis. The zebrafish is an ideal model to study cardiac development with genetically malleable, visually
transparent embryos. We established leading genetic means to observe, track, and isolate the earliest LPM
progenitors, and we have used these advances to image first steps in LPM emergence, heart development,
and mesothelium formation. Uniquely suited to pursue pericardium development, we now lineage-mapped and
live-imaged its origin not among cardiac, but mesothelium progenitors, challenging our view of the pericardium
as heart lineage per se. With single-cell approaches, mutants, and gene-regulatory experiments, we found that
expression and function of the transcription factor Hand2 supports pericardial progenitors in the LPM, in part in
cooperation with canonical Wnt signaling. We hypothesize that the pericardium forms as mesothelial
lineage with input from Hand2 to convey unique properties in development and disease.
 In Aim 1, we will test the distinct lineage origins of pericardial versus heart progenitors using photocovertible-
and multispectral Cre/lox-lineage labeling plus single-cell multiomics to define the gene-regulatory trajectory of
pericardium formation. In Aim 2, we will test the synergy of Hand2 with canonical Wnt signaling and will pursue
how individual target genes are controlled. Our work advances our concepts of pericardial orgins and
mechanisms of its development, regeneration, and pathologies. Our molecular insights help guide and
improve the in vitro generation of pericardial cells for regenerative applications."

The formation of discrete chromatin-chromatin interactions in the genome during the
differentiation of mammalian cells leads to the specific insulation of repressed chromatin domains
from those actively engaged in transcription. This partitioning thwarts the inappropriate invasion
of actively transcribing regions into those that must stay repressed⏤this process is highly
regulated and diversified during development, giving rise to the specific gene expression profiles
reflective of and inherent to markedly distinct cell types. The key proteins recognized as fostering
chromatin-chromatin interacting structures are cohesin, CTCF, and the newly recognized MAZ.
Cohesin is believed to extrude a loop of chromatin such that the endpoints of this loop merge with
two chromatin-bound CTCF proteins, thereby anchoring cohesin. CTCF and MAZ interact
independently with cohesin and exert their function through binding to specific pairs of CTCF and
MAZ DNA elements, respectively. Notably, CTCF also interacts with RNA which leads to its
multimerization and CTCF mutant in any of its RNA binding domains [Zinc Finger 1 (ZF1), ZF10,
and RBRi] gives rise to disrupted chromatin loop formation. Of particular interest in this study is
the CTCF mutant in its ZF1 as it retains all other CTCF functions. The approach here exploits the
mammalian HoxA-D clusters as an ideal model for investigating the process of insulation as a
function of differentiation as they exhibit linear and temporal regulation during development. This
project proposes to expand upon previous successful investigations of Hox gene regulation, which
led to the discovery of MAZ as a DNA-site-specific insulation factor, our recent findings of another
possible “site-specific insulator”, PATZ1, the key role of CTCF/RNA interaction in fostering the
integrity of chromatin boundaries, as well as the construction of synthetic HoxA clusters that when
placed ectopically exhibit all the regulatory features inherent to the endogenous version. With this
foundation, investigations of the features requisite to chromatin boundary formation as a function
of differentiation will include: genetic manipulations in vivo in conjunction with molecular biological
approaches to define the roles of MAZ and PATZ1 in insulating a portion of the HoxA cluster, the
identification of other potential insulating proteins that function at the HoxA cluster posterior to
that of MAZ and PATZ1, and an investigation as to whether RNAs interacting with CTCF are
determinant to particular chromatin boundary formation. The results from these multi-pronged in
vivo and in vitro approaches will reveal the regulatory and mechanistic basis by which chromatin
boundaries are organized, thereby dictating appropriate gene expression."
10801660,"PROJECT SUMMARY
New strategies to combat pneumonia caused by different pathogens are urgently needed. Inflammatory
macrophages play an essential role in clearing bacteria, fungi, and viruses during infections; however,
hyperinflammatory responses mediated by these cells can cause severe side effects, including death.
Immunotherapy that modulates macrophage polarization has shown promise in suppressing hyperinflammatory
responses while retaining the capability of macrophages to clear pathogens. To achieve successful
immunotherapy with RNA therapeutics, the following obstacles must be overcome: (1) rapid clearance of RNA
therapeutics by RNase in tissues; (2) poor cellular uptake of free RNA therapeutics; and (3) loss of RNA
therapeutics to non-infected tissues and potential off-target side effects. We previously discovered and
successfully transitioned to industry two nanotherapeutic systems that addressed these limitations for bacterial
infections. The elements of the nanosystems relevant to the present proposal are: high loading capacity for RNA
therapeutics; an ability to protect the RNA payload from degradation in vivo; and highly selective targeting of the
macrophages via pendant peptides. The proposed project hypothesizes that this approach may be generally
applicable across a spectrum of pathogens, and it aims to investigate treatment of viral and fungal pulmonary
infections. To address these goals, a deeper understanding of macrophage function and nanoparticle
interactions is needed, particularly in the context of pathogenic infections. Through three Specific Aims, we
propose to optimize and then evaluate three major nanoplatform-based systems that have shown promise for
nucleic acid delivery, and investigate the in vivo biological interactions of the targeted nanoplatforms to obtain
deeper understanding of macrophage polarization in combating pulmonary infections:
(1) Develop a targeting strategy for macrophage homing in infected lungs. We hypothesize designs that will allow
the nanoparticle to reach the infected regions of the lungs while preserving the potency of the RNAi therapeutic,
either by i.v. or by direct pulmonary delivery of nanoplatforms. This Aim will focus on screening for new peptides
that target macrophages in lung infection models, using the existing macrophage-targeting peptide CRV as a
benchmark. We will focus on well-established mouse models of pneumonia induced by carbapenem-resistant
K. pneumoniae, A. fumigatus, and influenza A.
(2) Develop, evaluate, and then downselect from three broad classes of nanoplatforms (i.e., lipid nanoparticles,
tandem peptide nanoparticles, and fusogenic porous silicon nanoparticles) to load RNA therapeutics. These
nanoplatforms will be targeted to macrophages in the infected lungs using peptides from Aim 1. Cytotoxicity,
gene knockdown efficiency, and macrophage polarization will be evaluated in vitro. Pharmacokinetics including

 Transcription of antiviral factors by the host cell is a fundamental aspect of innate immune responses to
virus infection. We recently discovered a novel transcriptional response in humans termed the “FACT-ETS-1
Antiviral Response (FEAR)” Pathway that restricts the replication of vaccinia virus (VV), a large DNA virus
belonging to the poxvirus family. Activation of this pathway requires the FACT complex, an ancient histone
chaperone that is conserved from yeast to humans. The human FACT complex is comprised of two protein
subunits, hSpt16 and SSRP1, that function together to regulate cellular gene transcription. Our work discovered
that FEAR pathway activation requires a novel, SUMOylated form of hSpt16 that is normally found in the
cytoplasm of cells but that translocates to the nucleus upon virus infection to form specialized FACT complexes
that activate expression of ETS-1. The ETS-1 protein is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors that
arose in multicellular animals ~600 million ago during evolution. Our previous work demonstrated that FACT-
induced ETS-1 expression is required for the restriction of VV in human cells. However, the VV-encoded A51R
protein functions as a FEAR pathway inhibitor by directly binding to SUMOylated hSpt16 and tethering it to
cytosolic microtubules. More recently, we discovered that both FACT and ETS-1 are also required to restrict the
replication of the RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Moreover, we found that the VSV-encoded matrix
(M) protein promotes the specific depletion of SUMOylated, but not non-SUMOylated, hSpt16 subunits during
infection. However, a mutant VSV strain encoding a single amino acid substitution in its M protein both fails to
deplete SUMOylated hSpt16 subunits during infection and strongly induces ETS-1 expression. These data
suggest that the FEAR pathway may also both restrict, and be antagonized by, RNA viruses. However, the
human genes that are regulated by ETS-1 during infection that contribute to RNA virus restriction are unknown.
Our preliminary data suggest that that genes upregulated by ETS-1 during VSV infection are largely distinct from
the interferon response, a well-characterized antiviral transcriptional response that inhibits diverse viruses.
Notably, we have also discovered that RNA viruses unrelated to VSV, such as paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses,
also specifically promote depletion of SUMOylated hSpt16 subunits during infection. We hypothesize that VSV
and these other RNA viruses encode FEAR pathway antagonists that deplete SUMOylated hSpt16 levels to
prevent FEAR pathway activation and expression of ETS-1-regulated antiviral genes. Thus, our study goals are
to: 1) Identify the human genes regulated by ETS-1 during RNA virus infection that are involved in virus restriction
and 2) Determine if the FEAR pathway restricts other RNA viruses besides VSV and whether these viruses
encode FEAR pathway inhibitors. Our long-term goal is to understand how the FEAR pathway broadly restricts
DNA and RNA viruses and how virus-encoded FEAR pathway antagonists contribute to viral pathogenesis."

Over the last decade, suicidal ideation and suicide death have increased significantly across all age groups, but
have shown the most dramatic rise in teens and young adults. There is clear evidence that greater access to
mental health care is associated with reduced suicide risk, but increasing mental health care using conventional
models faces multiple barriers; ensuring access to mental health care in rural areas is especially challenging.
Accordingly, innovative approaches to provide mental health care, and especially crisis intervention, to teens are
essential.
 SafeUT is a text-messaging app developed in conjunction with state government agencies that links Utah
teens who have a mental health crisis to a counselor who can provide support, assess suicide risk, triage to
emergency services, and refer for additional treatment. Our project will utilize a large, rigorously anonymized
repository of text-message data (>130,000 encounters and >2.3 million messages) contained within SafeUT to
predict important outcomes of using the app, such as being referred to emergency services, staying
engaged with the counselor, and receiving a thorough risk assessment. We will examine SafeUT data with
cutting-edge machine-learning techniques, including natural language processing, to develop ways of
predicting SafeUT users’ outcomes. These predictive systems will, ultimately, be used to produce real-time
feedback systems that monitor and help improve the quality of SafeUT services.
 The current proposal squarely addresses Notice of Special Interest NOT-MH-22-110 (Priority
Research Opportunities in Crisis Response Services), which emphasizes the importance of projects
addressing crisis care in children and which requests applications focused on the development of “assessment
strategies and decision-making aides (e.g., predictive algorithms) that incorporate demographic, clinical…and
contextual data…to guide tailored strategies for resolution of distress, referral, and engagement in appropriate
follow-up services.” These are precisely the goals of the project described here. Evaluating SafeUT’s impact is
essential to improving the service over time through counselor training, policy changes, and in future, the
development of real-time decision-support systems that enhance counselors’ interventions."

Data science methods provide an exciting opportunity to significantly improve the reproducibility and
replicability of rehabilitation research. However, a key barrier to implementing data science methods in
rehabilitation research is a lack of fundamental programming knowledge. In particular, many clinical and basic
scientists have not received formal training in programming skills required for data science. For this target
audience, the most efficient way to get started in data science is to receive personalized guidance from an
experienced mentor who can provide hands-on assistance and identify which skills are the most beneficial given
a specific research goal. However, many rehabilitation researchers do not have access to these types of mentors.
The proposed program (Reproducible Rehabilitation, or ReproRehab) addresses this need by providing
personalized, rehabilitation-specific, hands-on training in data science skills with direct, weekly support
from experienced mentors. The ReproRehab program will blend hands-on assistance, personalized
mentorship, and a uniquely rehabilitation-focused curation of online resources for self-guided learning, with three
specific aims. Aim 1 is to build a national workforce of rehabilitation researchers equipped to apply data
science skills to their own rehabilitation research. To accomplish this Aim, over the 5-year grant a total of
100 learners will undergo a personalized, 6-month program consisting of a 2-month TA-guided, hands-on
bootcamp in which learners are assigned to small groups with similar research needs, followed by a 4-month
self-guided learning segment to integrate the skills into their own research. By the end of the program, learners
will demonstrate the implementation of this knowledge into their own research, including but not limited to the
sharing of open-source rehabilitation datasets, open-source analysis code or methods, and more rigorous
research products. Aim 2 is to develop data science rehabilitation researchers who have the capacity to
teach and train others. To accomplish this Aim, over the grant’s 5 years a total of 40 TAs will refine their
teaching skills by administering bootcamps and providing hands-on training to learners. In addition, while the
learners pursue self-guided learning, TAs will develop and host their own bootcamps in their rehabilitation
communities, thereby fulfilling a train-the-trainer model for exponential growth and dissemination of data science
skills. Aim 3 is to broadly disseminate knowledge by creating an online repository of curated,
rehabilitation-specific data science resources, organized by rehabilitation research area, including
program materials. To accomplish this Aim, the leadership team will develop a public web database of existing
online data science resources, including training materials, public data archives, and all course materials from
this program, organized by specific rehabilitation research areas and needs. Successful accomplishment of
our aims will increase capacity in data science across the rehabilitation research community and will
improve the rigor, reproducibility and replicability of research needed to move the field forward."
10910196,"Project Summary: The Rocky Mountain Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RMRBL) at Colorado State
University (CSU) has been responsive to the national RBL mission to: 1) “Conduct research on biodefense and
emerging infectious disease agents”; 2) “Be available and prepared to assist national, state, and local public
health efforts in the event of a bioterrorism or infectious disease emergency” since its opening and full
commissioning in 2008. Researchers at the RMRBL and their collaborators rapidly pivoted in response to the
emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), working on host-derived
therapeutics, vaccines, and identifying other potential zoonotic reservoirs as spillover opportunities in wildlife
and domestic animals. Our researchers similarly pivoted this past year to work on countermeasures in
response to the re-emergence of Mpox, while also continuing to address high consequence pathogens that
have chronically plagued public health systems, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of
Tuberculosis. Beyond our demonstrated ability to rapidly address research and research service needs on
pathogens with pandemic potential, our team contributes to training, outreach, and access of our facility via
sponsored fellowships, visiting scholars’ programs, workshops, conferences, and through collaborations.
Despite these gains, our RMRBL BSL3 suites are aged, requiring constant investments to maintain safe,
secure and compliant BSL3 facilities. RMRBL BSL3 researchers, support staff, and biosafety professionals are
vulnerable to the strain of the work environment, limited resources, funding gaps, and opportunities to engage
in less risky fields equipped with cutting edge technologies. In this application, we respond to the challenges
facing the RMRBL BSL3 laboratories with 3 Cores. Core 1 includes an improved management structure,
systematic replacement of deprecating scientific instruments, and comprehensive and proactive maintenance
of existing facilities needs to ensure compliance and continuous functioning. Operation of the RMRBL BSL3 is
additionally enhanced to improve the working environment and increase consistency for operations research
support and animal husbandry staff. Core 2’s initiatives seek to develop training programs responsive to adult
learning and education best practices, ensuring improved safety and safety compliance in persons working in
the BSL3. Biosecurity upgrades will improve the safety and security climate in anticipation of new national
standards, and integration between research teams and the office of Biosafety in constructing and training in
technical standard operating procedures will accelerate safe performance and technical competence. Finally,
Core 3 synthesizes our research strengths to develop a uniquely qualified Biocontainment Research
Resources Core, bringing together opportunities to exploit team talent and perform innovative research.
Combined, our three Cores ensure that the RMRBL BSL3 facilities are always ‘warm ready’ – to face and
combat the next pathogenic pandemic threat."
10792230,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adversity, economic deprivation, poverty-induced stress, prolonged exposure to trauma and parental
distress increase the risk of child maltreatment and may severely undermine the mental health functioning of
children. While there are efficacious interventions targeting individual, family, and structural-level factors
associated with children’s emotional and behavioral well-being, it is unknown how these interventions interact
and complement each other and whether their effects can be synergistic (i.e., if the interventions’ combined
effects are greater than the sum of the individual effects).
 To improve mental health outcomes among children aged 7–14 from low-income families in Azerbaijan, the
proposed study will refine and test three evidence-based intervention approaches: (a) family-strengthening
intervention; b) trauma-focused mental health care for parents; and c) economic empowerment in the form of
Child Savings Accounts. These interventions have been adapted to the context of Azerbaijan. The adapted
interventions will be tested with 600 child-caregiver dyads in a trial using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy
(MOST) to compare different intervention components and identify the most optimal combination. Given the
limited human and financial resources in the LMICs, it will be important to identify whether each of these
interventions is necessary and/or sufficient for improving the mental health of children. The study will test the effects
of each intervention component on children’s clinical mental health outcomes (symptoms of depression,
anxiety; disruptive behaviors; post-traumatic symptoms;) and on cognitive and social processes associated
with these outcomes (e.g., attention, inhibitory control, working memory, emotion recognition bias). The study
will also examine the mediating pathways associated with each intervention component. If successful, the
study results could inform the National Mental Health Care reforms implemented by the Ministry of Health,
WHO, UNICEF and other organizations in Azerbaijan and other post-Soviet countries. The proposed study
addresses the NIMH’s Strategic Plan Objective 3.2.A by tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes,
and targets two top challenges within the NIMH Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal B (Advance
prevention and implementation of early interventions): 1) to develop locally appropriate strategies to eliminate
childhood abuse and enhance child protection and 2) to develop interventions to reduce the long-term negative
impact of low childhood socioeconomic status on mental health. Through training, mentoring and collaborative
research, the project also aims to strengthen local research expertise in: 1) the core components and
mechanisms of change of psychosocial mental health interventions for children and families living in conditions
of chronic adversity; 2) the adaptation of multilevel evidence-based interventions and measurement tools to the
new socio-cultural context of a post-Soviet country; and 3) methodological and statistical techniques for
evaluating complex interventions with multiple components."
10794248,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is consistently ranked as one of the top five most expensive conditions billed
to Medicare and has been the target of several cost containment measures, including Medicare’s Hospital
Readmissions Reduction Program. To improve outcomes after AMI hospitalizations, payers have implemented
public reporting, financial penalties, and alternative payment models that incentivize the assumption of financial
risk such as capitation. These measures have not been accompanied by evidence-based guidelines on how
health systems can improve outcomes after hospitalization. An impediment to such guidance has been an
incomplete understanding of patient-level factors that may influence the effectiveness of strategies to improve
post-AMI hospitalization outcomes as applied in real-world settings. Notably, 30% of patients hospitalized for
AMI are age ≥ 75. These patients have lower physiologic reserve and more functional impairments, including
those in cognition and physical capabilities, than younger patients. In the SILVER-AMI study, we enrolled 3041
patients age ≥ 75 hospitalized for AMI at 94 hospitals. The primary objective was to evaluate the contribution of
functional impairments and geriatric conditions to improving risk prediction for mortality within 6 months of
hospital discharge. The premise of the SILVER-AMI study was that risk prediction at the time of discharge could
identify high-risk patients who might benefit from more intensive post-hospital care. Findings from SILVER-AMI
have demonstrated that functional impairments substantially improve risk prediction for important outcomes. We
did not obtain Medicare data in this study so could not examine strategies being deployed in an effort to improve
post-AMI outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to refine our understanding of the impacts of
home health care (HHC) (Aim 1), early outpatient care (Aim 2), and Medicare Advantage (MA) (Aim 3) after AMI
hospitalization by examining their effects in the context of functional impairments and illness severity. We will
focus on outcomes of primary importance to older patients, including “home days” (days alive out of the hospital
and other inpatient facilities) and health status, as well as disease-specific outcomes of relevance post-AMI. We
will merge data from the SILVER-AMI study with Medicare data to achieve our aims. Combining these data
sources will afford us the unique opportunity of accounting for an array of rigorously assessed covariates that
are not generally available in studies using only administrative data and to identify patients who may benefit most
from post-discharge services. In addition to accounting for a rich array of measured confounders, we will employ
advanced statistical techniques to address bias from unmeasured confounding. We have assembled a team with
a track record of collaboration and expertise in cardiovascular outcomes, home health care, outpatient care
delivery, epidemiology, and biostatistics. This hypothesis-driven research will leverage the most comprehensive
set of data on functional impairments and geriatric conditions collected during AMI hospitalization on a large,
national cohort to inform strategies to improve outcomes of importance to older patients."

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common structural birth defects in humans and result in long-
term disability or even death; yet, the underlying genetic causes remain largely unknown. Addressing this gap in
knowledge is best achieved in the context of understanding the mechanisms mediating both normal and
abnormal development. Experiments conducted nearly 40 years ago indicate that expansion of the cranial
mesenchyme, a cell population that resides beneath the neural plate, is required for elevation of the cranial
neural folds and neural tube closure. Yet, little is known regarding how expansion of the cranial mesenchyme
drives neural fold elevation and how this process can be disrupted to cause NTDs. Moreover, few genes have
been implicated in this process.
In this proposal we present a novel mouse model of NTDs with a mutation in the Hectd1 gene and describe
approaches that will significantly advance our understanding of how cranial mesenchyme expansion can be
disrupted contributing to NTDs. Based on our previous and preliminary data we hypothesize that eHSP90
secreted from Hectd1 mutant NC-CM stimulates increase movement of the CM interfering with expansion
of the PM-CM and disrupting neural fold elevation (Specific Aims 1 & 2). We further hypothesize that
HECTD1 sequence variants associated with human NTDs employ the same pathogenic mechanism
(Specific Aim 3). We will test these hypotheses using a combination of innovative tools including: (1) advanced
imaging approaches to visualize, at unprecedented resolution expansion of the cranial mesenchyme in real time
during neural fold elevation, (2) fluorescently labeled eHSP90 probes to elucidate spatial and temporal patterns
of pathogenic eHSP90 production, (3) an ex vivo cranial mesenchyme explant assay amenable to experimental
manipulation, (4) a novel allelic series of mouse lines and (5) pharmacological inhibitors to test whether eHSP90
mediates failure of cranial mesenchyme expansion and neural fold elevation in Hectd1 mutant embryos. These
innovative tools will be combined with well-established conditional genetic, histological and embryological
approaches to delineate, in unprecedented detail, expansion of cranial mesenchyme in normal neural fold
elevation and how this process goes awry during failed cranial mesenchyme expansion responsible for NTDs in
the Hectd1 mutant embryo. This information will be used to determine the impact of predicted pathogenic
sequence variants of HECTD1 identified in human NTD cases and ascertain if variants disrupt HECTD1 function
and contribute to NTDs in human patients."

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths and
the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. Despite the advantages
of polyp screening for early detection, treatment options for advanced CRC rely on
aggressive chemotherapy. Therefore, targeted therapy for the treatment of CRC is
critically needed. Strikingly, clinical evidence has shown that compared to normal
intestinal tissue, human colorectal tumors exhibit a down-regulation of gene expression
of all components of the circadian clock molecular machinery. The circadian clock is the
endogenous biological pacemaker which controls several physiological, endocrine and
metabolic processes that operate to maintain organismal homeostasis within a strict 24-
hour period. Several lines of evidence suggest that disruption of circadian rhythms
results in cancer, yet the precise molecular mechanisms and detailed signaling
pathways have yet to be elucidated. Moreover, the crosstalk between the circadian clock
and proliferative pathways in the intestine is not fully elucidated, and more specifically,
how this crosstalk is involved in CRC initiation and progression in vivo remains
unresolved. To address this knowledge gap, we have generated a novel genetically
engineered mouse model (GEMM) to elucidate the effects of circadian clock disruption
on intestinal cell proliferation and CRC. We propose that genetic disruption of the
molecular clock machinery aberrantly drives Wnt/b-Catenin signaling in the intestine.
One goal of this proposal is to delineate the role of the circadian clock on Wnt-
dependent proliferation pathways in the intestine, including pathways that govern
cancer-initiating cell populations. A second goal of this proposal is to define the
molecular mechanism of how the circadian clock impinges on Wnt/b-Catenin dependent
transcriptional and epigenetic pathways. Our studies have important clinical implications
in understanding how disruption of the biological pacemaker, on the molecular level,
alters tumor initiation and disease progression to CRC. These findings provide novel
insight into the potential for therapeutic targeting of the circadian clock for treatment of
CRC, in addition to other tumors types dependent on activated Wnt signaling."

Endometriosis is associated with significant clinical, social, emotional, and financial burden on women and their
families. Endometriosis is a complex gynecologic disease affecting about 10% of women but remains poorly
understood at the molecular level. Endometriosis results from the establishment of ectopic islands of endometrial
tissue/cells on pelvic organs via retrograde menstruation. Although eutopic endometrium consists of a mixture
of stromal and epithelial cells, ectopic endometriotic tissue is comprised primarily of stromal cells that lack any
mutations but with widespread transcriptional and epigenetic defects. The transcription factor GATA2 is
physiologically expressed in normal endometrial cells, whereas GATA2 is deficient and replaced by GATA4 and
GATA6 (GATA-switch) in endometriotic stromal cells. However, the role of this “GATA-switch” in establishment
of transcriptomic, epigenomic, enhancer activity, and cellular states in normal endometrium and in endometriosis
is mostly unknown. Using eutopic endometrial samples from endometriosis-free women and patients with
endometriosis, and unique genetically altered human normal endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells, we
will establish distinguishing epigenomic, transcriptomic, and 3-D chromatin organization features of the
endometrium from endometriosis-free women, and endometriosis itself driven by GATA factor switch. Our study
will also define, at the integrative epigenome and transcription factor level and with mechanistic depth, whether
enhancer malfunction and the GATA transcription factor switch interact and whether this is a key contributor to
the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Using clinically relevant human samples, and unique mouse
endometriosis induction models, we will test our hypothesis in a setting that is closely related to the in vivo
condition, thereby significantly enhancing the relevance, novelty, and significance of the proposed studies. The
proposed studies are highly significant because they will also directly address the basic mechanism of
endometriosis using clinically relevant human samples, thereby removing a key barrier to knowledge. Execution
of the proposed research in an exceptional environment by scientific leaders with complementary expertise
studying complex gynecologic diseases, and genome-wide analyses will further enhance the impact of the
proposed work. This work is expected to reveal the common and distinguishing features of endometriosis with a
strong disease predictive value. Finally, new results stemming from our studies will identify actionable
epigenomic, and cellular features that can be targeted for future therapeutic interventions in endometriosis."

Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest associated with macromolecular damage and
secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which includes cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors. The SASP provides immune surveillance that recruits immune cells to clear senescent cells;
however, persistent senescence or enduring SASP production that exceeds immune clearance aggravates
inflammatory injuries. Ageing is a major driver of tissue senescence. Age-related accumulation of cellular
senescence is a major pathogenic factor responsible for the decline of tissue function and the increase in age-
related pathologies, but little is known about the molecular mechanism that drives tissue senescence. On the
other hand, age-unrelated senescence and its pathophysiological impact are understudied. For example, very
little is known about metabolic control of colonic senescence, its molecular mechanism and pathophysiological
consequences. Our goal is to tackle these questions and fill the knowledge gaps. Our preliminary studies
demonstrated that colon epithelial acetyl-CoA deficiency triggers robust p53-dependent colonic senescence,
and the accompanying SASP induces severe mucosal and systemic inflammation leading to premature death
in mice. Further investigation revealed that epithelial senescence and SASP are closely associated with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in both mouse colitis models and human patients. We also discovered that
gut microbe-derived acetate helps maintain host's epithelial acetyl-CoA pool to prevent colonic senescence.
Our data suggest that the acetyl-CoA status of colonic epithelial cells is determined by host ATP-citrate lyase
(Acly), acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (Acss2) and microbe-derived acetate; as such, gut dysbiosis, in the presence
of Acly and Acss2 down-regulation, leads to acetyl-CoA deficiency that triggers colonic senescence. Our
findings shed new lights on the development of age-unrelated colonic senescence and its pathogenic
connection to mucosal inflammation and colitis, and suggest that colonic senescence presents a novel
therapeutic target for IBD. To extend this investigation, we propose three Aims. In Aim 1 we will assess the
effect of acetyl-CoA deficiency in intestinal stem cells on colonic homeostasis. In Aim 2 we will elucidate the
molecular mechanism whereby nuclear/cytosolic acetyl-CoA deficiency triggers colonic senescence. In Aim 3
we will explore colonic senescence as a pathogenic driver as well as a novel therapeutic target of IBD. There
are vast knowledge gaps about age-unrelated colonic senescence and its pathological effects. There are huge
unmet needs for IBD therapy. This project will provide new mechanistic insights into metabolic control of
colonic senescence, and unveil the critical roles of acetyl-CoA and microbe-derived acetate in the regulation of
colonic senescence. For translational value, this project will uncover the link of colonic senescence to IBD
pathogenesis and prove senescence not only as a novel biomarker of IBD but also as potential therapeutic
target for IBD management."

Mental side effects of chemotherapy reduce quality of life and treatment dosing, thereby increasing mortality.
Current supportive care treatments are ineffective, thus identifying new interventions to prevent or reduce these
adverse side effects are crucial. We and others have recently hypothesized that gut dysbiosis may contribute to
the behavioral side effects of chemotherapy. Our long-term goal is develop novel microbial-based treatments for
the devastating side effects of the large and growing populations of chemotherapy-treated patients. The gut
microbial community is dramatically altered by chemotherapy and has recently been shown to communicate with
the brain to affect behavior. Indeed, we have previously published that altered composition of the gut microbiota
due to chemotherapy in mice drives central and systemic inflammation resulting in selective behavioral side
effects. Thus, the overall objective here is to determine the potential and feasibility of using fecal microbial trans-
plant (FMT) as an intervention for chemotherapy behavioral side effects. Three specific aims are proposed to
study this objective using our murine chemotherapy model (Aims 1 & 2) and a feasibility pilot clinical trial in breast
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (Aim 3). Aim 1 will quantify the efficacy of healthy FMTs in ameliorating
sickness and cognitive behaviors during chemotherapy. Efficacy of autoFMT, alloFMT, or saline delivered in a
preventative or therapeutic paradigm on sickness and cognitive behaviors will be assessed during chemotherapy
treatment in mice after mammary tumor resection. Aim 2 will identify the systemic and neurobiological correlates
of FMT interventions during chemotherapy. The efficacy of the FMT treatments on systemic and central inflam-
matory signals, and the specific role of microglia, will be assessed during chemotherapy in mice after tumor
resection. Aim 3 will pilot the feasibility of investigating the therapeutic potential for FMT to alleviate behavioral
and gastrointestinal chemotherapy side effects in early-stage breast cancer patients. A small group of patients
receiving chemotherapy will undergo an autoFMT or standard of care. Side effects will be assessed before and
after FMT. The proposed research is conceptually innovative and our interdisciplinary team will be the first to
use novel therapeutic FMT for chemotherapy-induced behavioral side effects in a combined basic and clinical
approach. This research project will provide the necessary mechanistic and clinical foundation for future pro-
posals focused on larger clinical FMT trials. This is the first step along a microbial research arc that has the
potential to alter how common chemotherapy drugs are administered."

Activation of  T cells is the mainstay of host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and
tuberculosis disease (TB). For decades,  T cells were thought to recognize solely peptide antigens bound to
polymorphic antigen presenting molecules encoded in the MHC locus. However, the discovery that human
CD1 proteins present mycobacterial antigens to T cells provides fundamentally new perspectives on the role of
T cells in host defense. First, the foundational studies for this R01 proposal showed that CD1 proteins present
mycobacterial glycolipids, phospholipids and lipopeptides to  and  T cells. Thus, lipids must now be
considered a diverse class of natural antigens for the human immune system. Second, whereas the MHC
locus is the most polymorphic of the human genome, the non-polymorphic nature of CD1 genes creates a
situation in which T cell responses are not restricted to an individual’s genotype. Such ‘donor-unrestricted T
cells’ have simplified patterns of antigen recognition and T cell receptor usage that could be exploited for
therapy. Building on substantial published and unpublished data, this human-focused renewal proposal seeks
to test a general model of antigen recognition in which T cell receptors (TCRs) bind onto a roof structure in
CD1, or shift away from the roof to contact bacterial antigen. Using recently validated human CD1a, CD1b and
CD1c tetramers, we will discover new conserved TCRs that are equivalent to NKT TCRs in the CD1d system.
We propose to determine the effector functions of newly discovered innate T cell types in humans, focusing on
genes that define an innateness gradient and the known effector functions needed to protect the host against
Mtb. Finally, we combine newly produced reagents, including tetramers, transfectants and monoclonal
antibodies, to use the guinea pig as a tractable model for study of host T cell responses in the lung and over
time. These studies contribute to an innovative view that the human T cell system recognizes and responds to
lipid antigens."

Deficits in goal-directed behavior are the hallmark of many neuropsychiatric diseases. The dorsomedial
striatum (DMS) has emerged as a key mediator of goal-directed actions, serving as a critical node for
integration of sensorimotor, motivational, and cognitive information. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms
mediating these fundamental behaviors remain largely unclear. We have recently discovered that the low
threshold spiking interneuron (LTSI) subtype within the DMS is a key regulator of early goal-directed actions.
Performing the first in vivo imaging of this cell type during behavior, we uncovered robust reward-related
activity that was down-regulated as animals learned an instrumental response task. Via subsequent neural
circuit manipulations, we demonstrated that this reduction in LTSI activity could drive learning, while sustained
activity slowed learning. In this proposal, we follow up these initial studies to explore the cellular and neural
circuit mechanisms of these effects. We hypothesize that downregulation of LTSIs enhances the
responsiveness of striatal circuits, a key step in driving behavior during early learning. We suggest LTSI
downmodulation enhances striatal gain via two synergistic mechanisms: (1) increased local striatal dopamine
levels and (2) enhanced corticostriatal input to SPNs via reductions in feedforward inhibition. Preliminary work
demonstrates that LTSI inhibition can enhance striatal DA release, which may be an underlying mechanism
driving enhanced acquisition. We will test whether LTSI inhibition enhances striatal DA during learning via
calcium imaging of DA neuron terminals and virally-expressed DA sensors. To better understand the
mechanism of this modulation, we will employ acute slice electrochemical measures of optically-evoked
dopamine release during manipulation of LTSI activity. Finally, we will use circuit-targeted manipulations of DA
neurons projecting to DMS to test whether enhanced striatal DA release is a mediator of the enhanced learning
accompanying LTSI down regulation. Existing literature and preliminary data also suggest that LTSI are
engaged in feed-forward control of SPN dendrites – a key site for the integration of incoming neural signals.
First, we describe both anatomically and electrophysiologically, how LTSIs integrate within key cortico- and
thalamostriatal circuits. Next we use 2-photon microscopy to zoom into the level of SPN dendrites and synaptic
spines, to understand how LTSIs regulate calcium signaling in these important compartments. In parallel, we
explore long-term synaptic changes that accompany learning. Finally, we test whether LTSI-mediated gain
changes within specific striatal circuits accounts for altered learning. When completed, these aims will provide
our first glimpse into how striatal LTSIs gate learning, improving our understanding of the cellular mechanisms
modulating goal-directed behavior."

 Improving the family environment, service access, and behavioral adjustment of children
with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has high relevance both for the children and their families
as well as for health care and service payors. Family environment is a critical influence on ASD
children’s adjustment: Poor parent adjustment increases behavior problems in ASD children,
reduces parents’ capacity to access and adhere to critical services, and dampens or eliminates
the benefits of early intervention. However, due to the stressors of navigating ASD-related and
medical services, as well as managing child behavior challenges, parents of children with ASD
report low levels of individual and couple adjustment. Parents report high levels of depression
and anxiety, and low levels of parental efficacy and couple relationship quality compared to
parents of typically developing children. To address the dual needs of parents for support in
navigating ASD services and maintaining positive family functioning, we propose to test Autism
Parent Navigators (APN), an innovative in-home, peer support model for parents with a young
child recently diagnosed with ASD. APN was designed to be feasible and scalable by relying on
parent peer mentors to conduct sessions. Extensive pilot work over the past 3 years has
generated evidence of feasibility, acceptability, and impact. This pilot work has allowed us to
fine-tune the parent mentor training, participant recruitment, delivery, and fidelity monitoring
procedures.
 Aim 1. To assess the efficacy of APN in a randomized trial with 180 families. Aim 2. To test
the mediating pathways through which APN impacts outcomes: We will test whether impact on
proximal targets (ASD-related appraisals; coparenting; parent self-efficacy about accessing
services; and peer mentor support) influence parent mental health, parenting, and treatment
engagement, and if these in turn influence child outcomes. Aim 3. To assess whether baseline
parent characteristics (financial stress, mental health, relationship conflict), child characteristics,
or program processes (fidelity, parent engagement) moderate outcomes."

mothers with HIV have been HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU). While HEU infants and children are known to
be at increased risk of adverse health outcomes, the long-term implications of in utero HIV/ART exposure into
adulthood have not been well explored. The candidate has generated novel preliminary data to show an
increased prevalence of obesity in HEU adolescents and young adults versus well-matched controls. These
findings convey the compelling need to characterize the extent of metabolic and immune dysregulation among
HEU young adults, and to delineate molecular pathways that may underlie this phenotype. Candidate: Dr.
Fourman is an endocrinologist and clinical investigator at Harvard Medical School dedicated to identifying
novel mechanisms and treatment strategies for metabolic disease. Her work thus far has centered on
metabolic complications of HIV. Her overarching career goal is to become an independent R01-funded clinical
investigator committed to preventing and treating obesity and metabolic disease in the rapidly growing HEU
population, as well as in other groups exposed to abnormal intrauterine environments. Training: To achieve
this goal, Dr. Fourman has developed a career development plan that will provide targeted training in
developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD), immunologic aspects of metabolic disease, design and
interpretation of epigenetic studies, and social and behavioral determinants of health. Mentors: The
candidate's career development and research plans will be overseen by her primary mentor, Dr. Steven
Grinspoon, who is an internationally recognized leader in metabolic disease research in HIV. The applicant
also will be supported by a highly invested team of co-mentors and advisors with expertise in DOHaD,
epigenetics, immunology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Research: Dr. Fourman will
leverage her background in endocrinology and HIV to test the innovative hypothesis that the HIV intrauterine
environment influences fetal development to confer an increased susceptibility to metabolic and immune
dysregulation later in life. Specifically, she will conduct the first prospective study that compares long-term
health outcomes in HEU young adults versus well-matched controls. In Aims 1-2, Dr. Fourman will delineate
the downstream metabolic and immune sequelae of in utero HIV/ART exposure among HEU young adults. In
Aim 3, she will investigate the contribution of epigenetic modifications to the HEU phenotype. This project
stands to establish in utero HIV/ART exposure as a previously unrecognized risk factor for metabolic disease.
Only by defining long-term metabolic and immune perturbations among the HEU population can screening and
prevention strategies be optimized for this group. Furthermore, this Award will launch Dr. Fourman on an
independent career trajectory, distinct from that of her mentors, to not only advance the health of the HEU
population, but also to investigate the developmental origins of metabolic disease in diverse clinical contexts."
10800186,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions in the central nervous system, affecting
~0.5% of the population. CCM patients experience debilitating neurological problems, which worsen as lesions
expand and progress. CCMs are triggered by endothelial cell germline and/or somatic mutations in one of the 3
genes (i.e. KRIT1, CCM2 or PDCD10) that encode components of the CCM complex. Disruption of the CCM
complex in endothelial cells drives clonal expansion and an “epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like” transition, resulting
in CCM formation. Symptomatic CCMs are usually treated by surgical removal, which is invasive and risky.
Pharmacological treatments for CCM are being tested. However, significant physical barriers exist for the
transport of systemically-administered drugs to the CCM microenvironment, especially for so-called “biologics”,
which typically exceed 1KDa in molecular weight. Indeed, human CCMs have little to no vascular access via the
CCM “lumen”. Growing CCMs do recruit a microvasculature that offers an alternative drug access route;
however, it retains significant blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, which will limit drug delivery.
 Here, we will develop MR image-guided strategies for targeted drug delivery to CCMs via transient
permeabilization of this perilesional microvasculature with focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles (MBs).
To set a foundation for this project, we previously developed and characterized transgenic mouse models of
CCM that recapitulate hallmarks of human disease, optimized longitudinal MR imaging to monitor CCM
progression, and confirmed via MRI that perilesional microvessels retain barrier function. In newer preliminary
studies, we deployed MRI-guided FUS+MBs to safely permeabilize perilesional microvessels. Furthermore, we
determined that, remarkably, CCMs exposed to FUS+MBs alone are chronically stabilized, providing a powerful
platform that may offer therapeutic synergy with augmented drug delivery. Given this premise and these
preliminary data, we are well-positioned to propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a robust MR
image-guided approach for the safe and effective delivery of drugs to the CCM microenvironment with FUS and
MBs. We will define relationships between acoustic feedback control systems, contrast agent delivery, and
safety. In Aim 2, we will leverage this information to define CCM-drug exposure curves for anti-angiogenic [Anti-
VEGF-A; 3TSR (Thrombospondin-1 fragment)] and anti-neuroinflammatory (Anti-CSF1R) biologics we
hypothesize will be efficacious in controlling CCMs, using ImmunoPET imaging. In Aim 3, we will control CCM
progression and its associated neuroinflammation via FUS+MB-mediated delivery of these biologics. Based on
the ImmunoPET measurements from Aim 2, we will tailor and implement protocols for delivery of each drug to
the CCM microenvironment. CCM progression, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and survival will be
examined. Given our FUS infrastructure and expertise, as well as our experience with translating FUS treatments
to clinical trials, we are exceptionally well-positioned to translate successful results to the clinic."
10800271,"Defining how phospholipid signaling networks control Th17 differentiation and effector function
Autoimmune diseases represent a substantial public health burden, affecting over 7% of the population (23.5
million people) and incurring costs upward of 1 billion dollars per year in the US alone. The adaptive immune
system generates an autoreactive response when self-tolerance mechanisms are broken. In this autoreactive
cascade, proinflammatory CD4+ T cell populations develop, damage host tissues, and cause disease pathology.
In autoimmune diseases, including MS and rheumatoid arthritis, the ratio of proinflammatory Th17 to regulatory
T cells (Treg) skews towards elevated Th17. Recent work suggests that reestablishing a healthy Treg/Th17
balance has therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases. The required cytokines and transcription factors that
program Treg versus Th17 differentiation are well established. Much less is known about the intracellular
signaling networks that drive Th17 differentiation. Identifying signaling proteins essential for Th17s and
dispensable for Tregs represent “vulnerable liabilities” to target with small molecule inhibitors. In our recent
publication, we systematically apply phosphoproteomics to profile kinase signaling during Treg versus Th17
differentiation. Our foundational phosphoproteomics datasets identify many new signaling circuits representing
new basic T cell biology and provide possible targets for drug therapies to block proinflammatory Th17 cells
while maintaining Treg function. We determined that phosphatidylinositol kinase, PIKFYVE, was differentially
regulated during Treg versus Th17 differentiation. Our biochemical analysis reveals that PI(3,5)P2 synthesis, the
product of PIKFYVE, is upregulated explicitly during Th17 differentiation, arguing that PI(3,5)P2 is an essential
signaling molecule specific to the Th17 differentiation program. Blocking PIKFYVE diminished Th17
differentiation and disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Our findings serve
as a solid rationale for mechanistically defining how PIKFYVE/PI(3,5)P2 promotes Th17 differentiation and EAE
disease. Inhibiting PIKFYVE is as effective at diminishing EAE disease as some FDA-approved therapeutics for
MS, establishing PIKFYVE/PI(3,5)P2 as a high impact target. Based on our published and preliminary data, we
propose the central hypothesis that PIKFYVE/PI(3,5)P2 is required for Th17 differentiation and EAE pathology.
We will determine how PIKFYVE/PI(3,5)P2 regulates immune cell function in the EAE model. This analysis will
determine if genetic deletion of PIKFYVE in CD4+ T cells downmodulates Th17 differentiation in the EAE model
and reduces neuroinflammation. We will also determine if blocking PIKFYVE diminishes effector T cell function.
Additionally, will determine the molecular mechanisms by which PIKFYVE/PI(3,5)P2 regulates Th17
differentiation. This analysis will identify how PIKFYVE regulates kinase networks and transcriptional programs
to support Th17 differentiation. Completing this work will define the importance of PIKFYVE in T cell biology and
inform therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases caused by Th17 cells."
10795890,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genomic deletions, including both focal and large arm-level chromosomal deletions, are frequent genetic events
that promote cancer initiation and progression. Focal deletions have yielded significant insights into mechanisms
underlying tumorigenesis by helping identify tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) residing in the deleted loci. In
contrast, little is known about the biological and phenotypic impacts of large chromosomal deletions in cancer
despite their occurrence 30 times more frequently than focal deletions. We and other researchers have shown
that such deletions impact the activities of multiple neighboring TSGs and constitute a driving force in
tumorigenesis. Additionally, concomitant loss of multiple genes triggered by broad-scale deletions can create
phenotypes that differ fundamentally from those arising from the loss of a single TSG, and may offer
unanticipated therapeutic opportunities. These losses should therefore be considered as distinct genetic events
and their analysis should be focused on the integrated effects of chromosomal deletion rather than the impact of
a single critical TSG. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models provide an ideal tool for investigating the
consequences of genetic aberrations in tumor biology. However, due to the limited cloning capacity of targeting
vectors (~300 Kb) and the rarity of on-target homologous recombination events in traditional gene-targeting
technology, modelling large chromosomal deletions in mice has proven highly challenging, and the in vivo role
of such lesions in tumorigenesis has therefore been significantly understudied. To fill this critical gap, we have
developed an innovative approach to chromosomal engineering over large genetic distances through
CRISPR/Cas9 technology in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The resulting ES clones carrying the desired
genome edits make possible the creation of conditional knockout mice that accurately mimic cancer-associated
large deletions. Given the prevalence and significance of large chromosomal deletions in prostate cancer, here
we propose to utilize our innovative approach to generate and fully characterize two novel GEM models that
each harbor a common but distinct prostate cancer-associated large deletion, with a goal of validating and
credentialing these models as genetically and biologically robust representations of human prostate cancer. In
Aim 1, we will develop conditional mouse lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target commonly deleted large
chromosomal loci in human prostate cancer.
In Aim 2, we will develop mouse models of prostate cancer harboring
large chromosomal deletions to analyze their biological and phenotypic impacts on prostate cancer development.
Taken together, these models and their characterization will meet multiple goals of this grant opportunity.
Successful completion of these investigations will not only contribute greatly to the implementation of precision
oncology research but also enhance the applicability of animal models to translational research."

10795686,"ABSTRACT
Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a chronic and progressive condition that currently affects over 6 million patients in
the US. It accounts for over $35B in annual healthcare expenditure and is responsible for over one million
hospitalizations each year. CHF is a chronic and progressive condition in which the heart is unable to pump
enough blood to maintain adequate circulation - the heart is failing to meet the body’s needs. Approximately half
of all patients with CHF have a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40% and are categorized as having
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF ≥ 50%) or mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF, 40%
≤ EF < 50%). The prognosis for these patients is poor: due to a paucity of treatment options, patients have 5-
year and 10-year mortality rates of 50% and 90%, respectively. Although existing pharmacological therapies
have demonstrated symptomatic improvement and mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF there are currently
limited FDA-approved treatment options (pharmacological or device-based) for the HFpEF patient population.
The concept of interatrial shunting has gained attention as a potential therapeutic option for patients with CHF.
By creating a connection between the high-pressure left atrium to the low-pressure right atrium elevated left atrial
pressure (LAP) may be effectively lowered thereby relieving CHF symptoms. Recently, several implantable
interatrial shunt devices have been shown to enable left atrial to right atrial blood flow, resulting in left atrial
decompression, a reduction in CHF symptoms, and improved quality of life in a number of promising human
clinical studies. Nonetheless intracardiac implants carry proven clinical risks including clot formation device
fracture, migration, and implantation failure. There is currently no device available that can provide therapeutic
left atrial decompression without the long-term clinical risks and concerns of leaving behind a foreign body in the
heart. Alleviant Medical has developed a novel transcatheter approach to relieve left atrial pressure by creating
an interatrial shunt without the need for a cardiac implant. Alleviant’s received FDA IDE approval following results
from device verification testing and results from the first-in-human clinical study to investigate the safety and
efficacy of a no-implant interatrial shunt for patients with heart failure. The goal of this proposal is three aims: (1)
to complete the testing of the ALV1 System, (2) develop necessary clinical screening and device procedure
training programs, and (3) submit a US PMA application to market the ALV1 System for alleviating symptoms
associated with elevated LAP in the HFpEF/HFmrEF patient population. To achieve this goal, Alleviant will
establish key verification test data demonstrating the reliability of the device in accordance with all internal risk
management and design control procedures and regulatory requirements. The Alleviant System is Class III in
the US and requires PMA approval. The methodology for this proposal will follow a risk-based product
development process and ISO Standard testing. Successful execution of this Phase IIB proposal will result in an
FDA PMA submission and commercialization of the ALV1 System."
10934578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common life-shortening genetic disorder, affects primarily Black youth in
the United States. SCD has its first health impact in infancy, but more severe complications (e.g., organ
damage, chronic pain, risk for early mortality) emerge in adolescence. Further, these racialized youth face
social determinants of health (SDOH)-related barriers (e.g., discrimination, access to care, financial hardship)
that may impact their access to care, resulting in missed opportunities to prevent complications and a higher
risk for disease progression. Effective disease self-management is essential to improving care and outcomes
and lowering healthcare costs for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD. However, there is limited
research available describing the specific factors that need to be addressed to improve self-management and
health outcomes for these youth. Our multidisciplinary team used a socioecological framework to develop a
novel ehealth self-management intervention for AYA with SCD called SCThrive. SCThrive combines group
sessions with a therapist with a companion mobile app. Our pilot work demonstrated improved patient
activation (knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy) and self-management behaviors in AYA with SCD compared to
a control condition. In addition, those who use the app more frequently showed more improvements. Older
AYA used the app less and reported more SDOH-related barriers to self-management. Thus, we will maximize
the clinical benefit of SCThrive by 1) adding app engagement strategies for older AYA, 2) conducting a more
systematic assessment of SDOH-related barriers, and 3) integrating ways to address these barriers into the
intervention. The objective of this proposed project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
adolescents with SCD across four SCD centers. Our aims are to examine the impact of SCThrive on patient
activation (primary outcome; Aim 1) and self-management behaviors, functional disability, health-related quality
of life, and emergency room visits (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment and follow-up (Aim 2). We
hypothesize that adolescents randomized to SCThrive will have greater improvement in patient activation
(primary outcome) compared to those randomized to standard care (control condition). We will also explore the
relationship between SDOH-related barriers (e.g., stigma, access to care) and treatment response (i.e., patient
activation and self-management behaviors). The team has expertise in SCD, patient activation, behavioral
interventions, ehealth/mhealth, adherence and self-management, health equity, RCT and statistical analyses
and has collaborated on pediatric SCD intervention studies that lay the foundation for this proposal. The study
is significant because it addresses the need for targeted, culturally tailored interventions to improve self-
management in adolescents with SCD. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates a robust
assessment and intervention strategy for SDOH-related barriers to self-management in SCD."
10796285,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity remains epidemic in the United States, with some of
the highest rates seen in older adults. While this phenomenon is certainly multifactorial, a good
deal of evidence suggests that insufficient physical activity (PA) contributes significantly. Pilot
data recently collected in our laboratory indicates a strong, inverse relationship between daily
step counts and body fatness and cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors when step counts are
expressed relative to fat mass in young adults. This expression of PA may be especially
predictive of body composition because it is influenced by factors that influence appetite and
energy intake, energy expenditure, and the energy “reservoir” that is represented by body fat
stores, all three elements of the “settling point” model of body weight. The strength of this
relationship suggests that prescription of step counts that consider current body weight and
composition, and weight loss goal, may yield predictable changes in weight and CMR in adults
eating ad libitum. The long-term objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between
daily step counts and body composition in young, middle aged, and older adults who are
overweight/obese and develop a regression model that can be used to prescribe physical
activity (daily step counts) for achieving a specific target body weight and predictably improving
CMR risk for young, middle-aged, and older adult men and women over eight months while
eating ad libitum. To achieve this objective, we will undertake two specific aims: 1) quantify the
relationship between average steps·kg fat mass-1·day-1 and body composition/CMR profiles in
healthy, overweight, and obese adults 20-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years, and 80-plus years
old, using inexpensive, widely available triaxial pedometers while eating ad libitum, and 2)
quantify the efficacy of employing targeted step counts expressed as steps·kg fat mass-1·day-1
using the model developed in Aim 1 for producing predictable improvements in body
composition and CMR factors in overweight and obese adults 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, and 80-plus
years old, over 8 months while eating ad libitum. This study will result in a regression model that
may significantly improve the way that PA is prescribed for weight management, with vast
clinical and public health implications."
10798581,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive deficits are a major determinant of the long-term disability associated with severe
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (Sz). The antipsychotic medications currently available do
not satisfactorily address Sz-related cognitive symptoms. Normal brain and cognitive function require networks
of distributed brain regions to maintain stable, yet flexible communication. The focus of this study is the default
mode network (DMN), which is a brain-wide functional network that is generally associated with introspective
processes and is conserved across mammalian species. Suppression of DMN activity is important to allow
Task-On associated network when subjects are performing tasks that require interaction with the environment.
Impaired DMN suppression has been observed in Sz patients and is associated with psychopathology,
particularly cognitive impairments. Recent evidence suggests the basal forebrain (BF) represents an important
DMN node and may play a central role in the regulation of DMN activity. Deficits in functional network
dynamics have been suggested to be related to perturbations in the balance of cortical excitatory and inhibitory
neurotransmission (E/I Balance). Our published findings show that optogenetic stimulation of BF parvalbumin
neurons (BF-PV) alters cortical E/I balance, eliciting an elevation in spontaneous cortical gamma band activity
(>30 Hz, GBA), and behavioral phenotypes that resemble psychosis. Through our proposed work, we will
illuminate the mechanisms behind subcortical modulation of DMN versus the Task-On network activity and
inform novel therapeutics to restore impaired network connectivity in psychiatric disorders affecting Veterans.
RESEARCH DESIGN: The Overall Hypothesis postulates that long range inhibitory GABAergic BF-PV
output from the BF fine tunes cortical E/I balance and that this process is critical for efficient suppression of
DMN activity that is needed for the transition to a predominance of Task-On network activity required for
cognitive performance. Aim 1 will confirm that local BF GBA is associated with GBA throughout the DMN and
will characterize the cortical regions associated with DMN-like neural oscillations in mice. Aim 2 will build upon
these findings by examining how transitions between DMN and Task-On network function is regulated by BF,
specifically BF-PV neurons, during operant tasks targeting both attentional and executive function domains of
cognition. Finally, Aim 3 will utilize cutting-edge fiber photometric techniques to directly assess the ability of
BF-PV neurons to influence cortical E/I balance across a range of behavioral contexts. Further, these aims will
examine DMN activity, and its regulation via BF, in two translationally relevant mouse models of Sz that mimic
the neurochemical changes of the human Sz brain (i.e., 2 models of glutamatergic NMDA receptor
hypofunction). Finally, optogenetic modulation of BF-PV neurons will be used to probe both E/I balance and
DMN network function, and to mitigate Sz-like patterns of brain activity and function in the mouse Sz models.
METHODOLOGY: Here we will utilize an innovative multimodal state of the art, approach to directly examine
how basal forebrain modulation of cortical disinhibition helps to regulate functional network activity relevant to
cognition. Multi-site electrophysiological measures and fiber photometry will be used in to help validate a novel
preclinical model to define circuit-level explanations to better understand the physiologic basis of DMN and its
interaction with other functional networks such as the Task-On network, and for abnormalities in functional
network activity (elevated DMN activity) and cognitive symptoms associated severe neuropsychiatric disorders.
IMPACT/SIGNIFICANCE: These experiments will provide a better understanding of aspects of coordinated
neural activity that are important for cognition. Further, it will characterize a subcortical pathway capable of
modulating E/I balance and interrogate this pathway as a novel therapeutic target to rescue impairments in
psychiatric disorders. This work is novel and will provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis behind a variety
of neuropsychiatric disorders, and lay groundwork for the development of therapeutics for effective treatment."

The Stanford Stroke Center, one of the first comprehensive multidisciplinary centers of its kind, was established in 1992 to develop new approaches to diagnose and treat stroke. The mission of the Stroke Center is to be the best comprehensive organization in the United States focused on stroke diagnosis, treatment, research, and education. In 1992, the Center was established by a team of neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, nurse specialists, basic scientists, and clinical researchers. This multi-disciplinary team has met regularly to continually refine the program for 30 years. In 2012, the Joint Commission and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association announced that the Stanford Stroke Center was the first hospital in the United States to meet The Joint Commission's standards for Disease-Specific Care Comprehensive Stroke Center Certification. Stanford was chosen to be one of the original StrokeNet Regional Coordinating Centers (RCCs). During the initial grant period, Stanford developed the DEFUSE 3 study, which became the first clinical trial to be funded and executed by StrokeNet. This 40-site trial that tested the efficacy of endovascular therapy in the delayed time- window among patients selected with advanced neuroimaging techniques was extremely successful; enrollment rates were substantially ahead of projected targets and the trial stopped early for efficacy. The publication of the DEFUSE 3 trial results instantly changed practice guidelines and clinical practice around the world. It is now standard of care to treat patients with endovascular therapy in the delayed time-window if they meet DEFUSE 3 imaging criteria. This change in practice has nearly doubled the number of patients that can be treated with endovascular therapy. Stanford’s regional network is one of the highest enrollers in StrokeNet studies and Stanford faculty have made major contributions to key StrokeNet committees. The Stanford-RCC will continue to provide high volume enrollment of diverse patient populations into NINDS funded stroke trials. The Stanford RCC will also continue to offer an innovative multidisciplinary fellowship program that provides comprehensive training in clinical trial design, implementation and analysis. In addition, Stanford faculty members will continue to propose new clinical trials for implementation through StrokeNet."

Current approaches to informed consent hinder rather than help research recruitment. Informed consent
templates often include legal jargon, technical wording, and numerous repetitive and confusing sections. The
consent process and templates can increase disparities in study participation among racially minoritized

and recommendations to improve understanding and adoption of evidence-informed practices for consent in
clinical trials. Yet these tools and recommendations are not widely used in practice. In this project, we will used
mixed-methods to address this gap between knowledge and practice. We aim to: (1) Engage with key
stakeholders to improve these forms and processes in a way that is feasible, acceptable, and sustainable; (2)
Prepare an improved consent template and process for implementation; (3) Implement and test the consent
template and process in three studies (1 per institution at 3 institutions). We will use Expert Recommendations
for Implementing Change (ERIC) strategies to ready sites for implementation, focusing on strategies to
increase capability, opportunity, and motivation to implement change. A community advisory board will actively
engage in the study for its duration to ensure that each step of the process aligns with their needs. Our strong
study team has expertise in research ethics, health literacy, health communication, health decision making and
implementation science. This study will overcome barriers to translation by providing: (1) A toolkit to facilitate
adoption of an evidence-based informed consent template and process, and (2) a national model for
participant-centered informed consent, meeting regulatory requirements without overburdening participants or
researchers. We will test our intervention’s robustness in different environments with different regulatory
systems for research and unique institutional strengths."
10797605,"Abstract
Meaning in speech is conveyed by time-varying structures, such as phonemes and words, that have highly
variable durations. As a consequence, there is a fundamental difference between integrating across physical
time (e.g., 100 ms) and speech structure (e.g., a phoneme). Auditory neurophysiology models typically assume
that neural integration is yoked to physical time, while many psycholinguistic theories posit that integration in
speech is yoked to abstract structures such as phonemes. At present, very little is known about whether neural
computations in the cortex are yoked to time or structure. As a consequence, it is unclear if there is a change
from time- to structure-yoked integration across the cortex, and if so, where this transition occurs and what types
of structures and computations might explain it. Filling this knowledge gap is essential to linking auditory models
and cognitive theories, constructing integrated neurocomputational models of auditory-speech processing, and
understanding how auditory deficits and neurological disorders impact the neural computations that underlie
speech perception. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by systematically testing whether neural integration windows
throughout the human cortex are yoked to time or structure and developing unified computational models that
can account for both time- and structure-yoked computation in the brain. Our experimental approach is to rescale
the duration of all speech structures (e.g., using stretching/compression) and measure the extent to which the
neural integration window rescales with structure duration. We measure integration windows using temporally
precise intracranial recordings from human neurosurgical patients, combined with a novel experimental method
that makes it possible to estimate integration windows from highly nonlinear systems like the brain (Aim I). We
also use the dense, whole-brain coverage of functional MRI to spatially map time- and structure-yoked integration
(Aim II), and we leverage statistical decomposition techniques developed by the PI to integrate our intracranial
and fMRI data. Finally, we use encoding models to directly examine the neural integration of specific, theoretically
important acoustic features and speech structures, as well as develop new computational models that can
explain time- and structure-yoked integration in a common framework (Aim III). Preliminary data suggest there
is a transition from time- to structure-yoked integration across the putative cortical hierarchy with weak structure
yoking in the superior temporal gyrus, where selectivity for speech structure first emerges, and strong structure
yoking in higher-order regions of the superior temporal sulcus that integrate over longer multi-second timescales.
We also show that deep neural networks trained to recognize speech structure directly from sound learn to
integrate across speech using short time-yoked windows at early layers and long structure-yoked windows at
later layers, providing a promising model to account for our neural data and helping to bridge the gap between
traditional auditory and psycholinguistic theories."
10799247,"Summary
Thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and deep vein thrombosis are the
leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The objective of this proposal is to test
the usefulness of a calorie-restriction (CR) intervention to diminish prothrombotic effects in aged
mice or aged mice with type 2 diabetes and identify a druggable target. Our pioneering studies
have established that increased thrombotic susceptibility in aging is associated with platelet
hyperactivity due to excessive accumulation of oxidants or the reactive oxygen species. We also
observed that the loss in mitochondrial superoxide-dismutase (SOD2) activity within platelets
increases mitochondrial-oxidant burden in aged mice and enhances platelet activation and
susceptibility to arterial thrombosis. Our novel pilot data shows that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a
mitochondrial-deacetylase that regulates the activity of several mitochondrial-proteins including
SOD2 is markedly decreased in platelets from aged mice and humans. Consistent with these
observations, in an ongoing clinical study, we observed that increased platelet activation in
healthy older humans and obese-diabetics was overcome by pre-incubation with SIRT3
activator or a SOD2 mimetic, suggesting a Mito-oxidant dependent mechanisms. Recently, we
also reported that the increased potential for venous thrombosis during aging is mediated via
increased total cell-free DNA and this increase is likely due to elevation in mitochondrial DNA.
The damaged circulating mitochondria with cardiolipin surface may also enhance thrombin
generation potential and venous thrombosis. So, a major goal of this proposal is to determine a
role of damaged-mitochondria that mediates age-associated arterial and venous thrombosis and
identify preventive measures. In search for a mitochondria-based protective mechanisms, we
conducted a pilot study and employed a 30% CR in aged mice or aged mice with type 2
diabetes for a month. This 30% CR increased platelet-SIRT3, decreased damage in
mitochondria, decreased platelet activation and lowered thrombotic susceptibility. We
hypothesize that CR protects from age-associated arterial- and venous thrombosis through
distinct mitochondrial mechanisms. We will also test that the presence of insulin resistance or
type two diabetes exacerbates mitochondrial damage and enhances thrombosis which is also
preventable with CR. Aim 1 will focus on platelet SIRT3 activation as a protective mechanism of
CR for arterial thrombosis. Aim 2 will test whether CR prevents from circulating damaged-
mitochondria and mitochondrial-DNA and lowers the susceptibility to venous thrombosis. Thus,
the significance of this proposal is in establishing usefulness of a healthy life-style-intervention
to diminish prothrombotic effects in aging and age-associated comorbidity and identify a
druggable target downstream to CR for translational application."
10799427,"Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are widely used antimicrobials in disinfecting products, medical products, and
food processing industries, suggesting humans may be exposed chronically to BACs through various routes.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to greatly increased use of disinfectants, resulting in a 174% increase
in median BAC levels in human blood. We recently analyzed 15 de-identified human fecal samples collected
during COVID-19 and detected BACs in all of them, ranging from 55 nM to 2.74 µM (a 50-fold difference). BACs
are potent antimicrobials, but their effect on the gut microbiome has not been examined, which is the major gap
that this proposal aims to fill. Our goal is to characterize the effect of BAC exposure on gut microbiome compo-
sition and function, microbiota metabolism, and altered liver metabolism via the gut-liver axis. We previously
reported that BACs are metabolized by human cytochromes P450 (CYP) in the liver. Our preliminary data sup-
port biliary excretion from the liver to the intestine being the major route of elimination for BACs. Thus, exposure
of gut microbiome to BACs is inevitable regardless of the route of exposure. Disruption of the gut microbiome
can lead to changes in endogenous and xenobiotic metabolism through modulating the ligand availability for the
bile acid-sensing farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the lipid-sensing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha
(PPARa), and xenobiotic-sensing constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Im-
portantly, in a preliminary study, we found that BAC exposure in mice significantly upregulated the expression of
Cyp2c38, Cyp2j6, Cyp4a10, and Cyp4f13 in the liver, which is consistent with the inhibition of CAR and/or acti-
vation of PPARa. Thus, we hypothesize that BACs reduce gut microbiome diversity and alter the metabolism of
xenobiotics, bile acids, sterols, and lipids in the liver by modulating the activities of nuclear receptors. In Aim 1,
we will characterize the impact of BAC exposure at different doses and exposure regimes on gut microbiome
diversity and function in mice. We will then correlate the changes in microbiome functional genes with the
changes in the gut bile acid, sterol, and lipid profiles. In Aim 2, we will measure the effect of BAC exposure on
bile acid, sterol, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism in the liver of conventional and germ-free mice. Relationships
between bile acid, sterol, and lipid profiles and relevant gene expression levels in the liver will be evaluated.
Activation or inhibition of nuclear receptors regulating xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) will be as-
sessed. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the relationship between BAC levels and gut microbiome diversity and function
in humans. The significance of this project lies in that it will allow us to begin to understand the impact of in-
creased BAC exposure on gut microbiome and gut-liver interactions in humans. The innovation of this project
lies in that a) it represents the first study to examine the impact of BAC exposure on gut-liver interactions, and
b) alteration of XME gene expression by BAC exposure represents a novel gene-environment interaction that
could affect the metabolism of endogenous metabolites and other xenobiotics."
10798987,"Radiation exposure can have detrimental effects to human health. Exposure to high doses of radiation can
provoke acute radiation syndrome within days and often results in death of the exposed. Exposure to
suboptimal doses of radiation does not result in acute radiation syndrome but can significantly increase the risk
of cancer in humans. Human activities such as medical treatment (x-rays, CT scans, radiotherapy), nuclear
power plant jobs, space explorations and warfare (atomic bombs) have made radiation exposure inevitable.
Most importantly relevant to this project, military personnel are directly involved in a number of these activities
and are at high risk for getting exposed to high levels of radiation that are detrimental to health. Thus,
understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms that proceed radiation exposure is critical for developing
new targeted therapies to treat radiation-induced illness. Specifically, how cytoplasmic sensors are involved in
radiation-induced illness is understudied. Our preliminary data demonstrate that RIPK2, independently of its
known receptors NLRC1 and NLRC2, provoke radiation-induced acute illness. WT mice succumb to 6.5-7Gy
lethal radiation within 2-4 weeks of exposure, whereas mice deficient in RIPK2 show not only delay in onset of
disease, but also significant protection from death with more than 50% mice surviving the endpoint of the
experiment. Interestingly, mice deficient in NLRC1 and NLRC2, the only known sensors upstream of RIPK2,
are hypersusceptible to the same 6.5-7Gy radiation dose when compared to WT mice. These NLRC1 and
NLRC2-deficient mice show early onset of disease, morbidity and mortality when compared to WT controls.
Furthermore, WT and RIPK2-deficient mice co-housing experiments suggest a potential role for microbiota in
radiation-induced lethality. These data highlight a central role for RIPK2 in promoting radiation-induced
lethality. In aim 1 – first, we will examine the distinct and opposite role of NLRC1 and NLRC2 vs. RIPK2 during
radiation-induced lethality in mice; second, we will determine gut epithelium intrinsic role for RIPK2 in radiation-
induced lethality; and third, we will investigate cell death pathways that are induced upon radiation and
examine the cell death pathways regulated by RIPK2 during radiation exposure. In aim 2 – first, we will
examine the effect of antibiotics and fecal microbiome transfer on the outcome of radiation-induced lethality in
WT and RIPK2-deficient mice; second, we will examine the effect of colonization of recipient host with WT- or
RIPK2-enriched bacteria; third, we will elucidate the fecal microbial landscape in WT and RIPK2-deficient mice
before and after radiation using 16S rRNA sequencing; and fourth, we will test the hypothesis that RIPK2
supports specific gut microbiota observed. Successful completion of these projects will elucidate cellular and
molecular mechanisms involving RIPK2-mediated illness observed in radiation exposed mice and hopefully
identify signaling nodes that can be targeted for therapeutics."
10799530,"Prolonged exposure (PE) is a gold standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but it
fails to fully resolve PTSD in approximately half of Veterans who initiate it. Better understanding the
mechanisms underlying PE could increase Veteran response rates by informing new therapeutic strategies to
enhance PE and more accurate methods for identifying who will benefit from PE. The main interventions
components in PE are a) imaginal exposures, which involve repeatedly describing the memory of a previous
trauma, and b) in-vivo exposures, which involve confronting safe yet distressing situations that resemble the
trauma. The effectiveness of PE exposures at ameliorating PTSD appears to largely depend upon their ability to
facilitate fear extinction, as operationalized by reduced fear when the exposure is performed again. In PE,
clinicians attempt to facilitate fear extinction (i.e., lower fear in future exposures) by focusing on within-session
habituation (WSH) – an acute decline in fear during the current exposure. However, WSH tends to poorly
predict future fear levels in the laboratory and symptom reduction during PE, suggesting it is an insufficient
marker of exposure effectiveness. Instead, fear extinction appears to be driven by inhibitory learning (IL),
wherein the memory of a feared outcome not occurring during a feared situation inhibits fear when the same
situation is encountered again. Within exposures, IL can be measured by how much the patient's conscious
expectation of their feared outcome (i.e., threat expectancy) decreases after the outcome fails to occur. IL, as
indexed by reduced threat expectancy following each exposure, has shown promise as a mechanism of
exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. However, the role of IL in PE for Veterans has yet to be investigated.
 To address this gap, the proposed study will use a multimodal collection of clinical, laboratory, and
mobile health measures to systematically evaluate whether IL is predictive of fear extinction and symptom
reduction during PE for Veterans. 80 Veterans with PTSD will complete a standard course of PE over
telehealth. Mobile health technologies will be used to assess IL (i.e., changes in threat expectancy ratings from
pre- to post-exposure) and fear-related responses (i.e., peak levels of subjective distress and physiological
arousal during each exposure). Participants will also complete a behavioral fear extinction task prior to PE that
will assess their capacity to experience IL, as measured by how much their expectancy for an aversive stimulus
decreases following instances where it does not occur. Our overarching hypothesis is that each measure of IL
will predict better fear extinction during exposures and more improvement in PTSD symptoms during PE. We
will specifically examine whether greater reductions in threat expectancy during each exposure type (imaginal
and in-vivo) predict lower peak levels of subjective fear and physiological fear during subsequent exposures
(aim 1) and whether these same IL measures also predict lower PTSD symptoms in subsequent PE sessions
(aim 2). These aims will allow us to determine whether threat expectancy offers a better marker of therapeutic
progress during PE exposures compared to the current method (i.e., WSH). In addition, we will examine
whether the capacity to experience IL, as measured within a behavioral fear extinction task at pretreatment,
predicts a steeper decline in PTSD symptoms during PE (aim 3). This aim will allow us to determine whether a
pretreatment measure of IL capacity can be used to accurately determine a Veteran's potential to benefit from
PE. Through this study, the applicant will merge his prior experience with laboratory threat learning research
with new mentorship in a) conducting clinical research studies of PTSD, b) evaluating treatment mechanisms
with intensive longitudinal data and mobile health technologies, and c) assessing fear extinction and
psychophysiology in Veterans with PTSD. This training will prepare the applicant to embark on a VA research
career that seeks to apply laboratory models of cognitive-emotional processes to improve our understanding
and delivery of exposure-based treatments for Veterans with PTSD and other related conditions."
10797049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposed study will comprehensively stage individual disease burden and mortality risk
at initial diagnosis and across the course of care for patients with chronic limb threatening
ischemia (CLTI). This debilitating, progressive condition is the most severe form of peripheral
artery disease, and successful treatment requires ongoing combinations of endovascular or
open revascularization, medical and wound/podiatric care. Because CLTI manifests in the
extremities, limb-based classification systems like the existing Wound, Ischemia, and foot
Infection (WIfI) staging system are important tools; however, the goals for CLTI treatment are
often broader than limb salvage and include freedom from recurrent disease and survival.
 Despite the availability of multiple life- and limb-preserving treatments, success in improving
health outcomes of patients afflicted with CLTI has been limited. The recently completed BEST-
CLI randomized controlled trial with 1830 adult participants determined that surgical vein bypass
is the most effective initial revascularization approach for patients with CLTI, but almost 10%
required re-intervention to maintain blood flow to the limb, 10% underwent major limb
amputation, and 33% died within two years. The need for frequent re-intervention for patients in
the BEST-CLI study demonstrates that long-term CLTI and survival outcomes are dependent on
the sequence of treatments beyond the initial revascularization strategy. Yet, how post-primary
revascularization treatment impacts outcomes among different types of patients is unknown.
 Our proposed study addresses these limitations. Using precision medicine analytics and
machine learning, we will leverage the rich BEST-CLI trial data to identify clusters of limb
characteristics, anatomic patterns of atherosclerosis, and comorbidities that associate with
differing levels of CLTI-free survival. Moreover, with the BEST-CLI longitudinal patient
assessments, we will quantify the impact of different post-primary revascularization treatments
on CLTI-free survival. This study will provide a deeper understanding of the limb- and life-
preserving effect of different combinations of medical and surgical treatments over time,
especially among patients who do not respond to first-line surgical interventions. Together, our
results will help clinicians set expectations and, if warranted, change practice based on likely
CLTI-free survival at initial diagnosis and over the lifespan of each patient. In the future, the
evidence generated from our study will be incorporated into precision medicine clinical trials
such sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) for discovering and testing
optimal, individually tailored treatment regimens for CLTI."
10801111,"Abstract
 The integrity of the lipid and cholesterol-enriched lens membrane is vital to lens homeostasis, stiffness, and
transparency, serving as an impermeable barrier to cations and scaffold for major lens membrane proteins, such
as aquaporin 0 (AQP0) and ion pump. Aging is a primary risk factor for cataractogenesis and presbyopia, and it
drives a significant degree of lens membrane lipids compositional changes, such as the decline of unsaturated
glycerophospholipids and the steady increase of more saturated sphingomyelin lipids. The steep decline of highly
unsaturated glycerophospholipids in the lens is believed to result from selective lipid peroxidation, closely
associated with lens stiffness and membrane disintegration. Accumulated lens membrane disintegration can
cause a cataract, and increased lens stiffness is a primary cause of presbyopia. Despite overwhelming
suggestions, the direct link between lipid peroxidation and lens membrane transformation, and its impact on lens
stiffness and opacity, has yet to be established. Our studies have suggested that GPX4/GSH plays a crucial role
in maintaining lens plasma membrane integrity and transparency, as well as protecting against lipid peroxidation-
mediated cell death, such as ferroptosis. In this application, we aim to address these questions using in vitro
lens epithelial cell culture and in vivo mouse models directly targeting GPX4. The outcome of this study will
provide valuable insights into the lens membrane biology of aging and age-related cataractogenesis and
presbyopia."
10928220,"Background: Antibiotic overuse threatens patient safety by causing adverse effects and threatens
the effectiveness of antibiotics through the development of antibiotic resistance. Although our
research team and others have been successful in improving antibiotic prescribing during office visits
using behavioral economics and communication strategies, the improvements have generally been
modest and generally focus on clinician behavior. Patient-directed interventions have usually been
visit-based, educational, and generic. We have written about a need for patient-centered
stewardship, which would use a theory-informed approach to engage directly with high-
inappropriate-antibiotic-utilizing patients outside of visits about their own concerns and behavior.
Research Strategy: To understand and address high-inappropriate patient antibiotic use, we will
conduct a mixed-methods project including controlled cohort studies, qualitative analyses, and a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a patient-centered behavioral nudge. Specific Aim 1 is to
perform retrospective, patient-focused, controlled cohort studies of adults and children in 2 health
systems (over 1.5 million patients) to categorize high-antibiotic-use as appropriate, partially
appropriate, potentially appropriate, and inappropriate. Specific Aim 2 is to conduct qualitative
interviews with high inappropriate-antibiotic-utilizing patients to identify social and behavioral factors
that influence care-seeking and antibiotic use, informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework
(TDF) framework. Specific Aim 3 is to – based on findings from Aims 1 and 2 – develop, refine, and
evaluate in a controlled pilot RCT the impact of a patient-centered stewardship behavioral nudge
intervention to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use among high-antibiotic-utilizing patients. The primary
outcome will be the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions over 8 months. Secondary
outcomes will include non-antibiotic medication prescribing, implementation outcomes (feasibility and
acceptability), spillover effects, and unintended consequences.
Implications and Future Directions: We seek to understand and intervene on patient care-seeking
and inappropriate antibiotic use. This project will lay the groundwork for a future, larger RCT testing
the effectiveness of components of the intervention in a broader patient population. The ultimate
goals of this project and subsequent interventions and evaluations are to better understand patient
concerns, care-seeking, and antibiotic use; enable effective engagement with care; improve
diagnostic accuracy; and ensure antibiotic prescribing quality to improve patient safety, decrease
adverse drug events, and limit the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria."

Middle-age adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a 2.6x higher risk for early-onset Alzheimer’s
disease and other dementias than non-ASD. In children, ASD prevalence is ~2%. Since ASD is a lifelong
condition, there will soon be a large population of elderly with an ASD diagnosis (~700,000 in the U.S within
the next decade), with a lifetime cost of ~$3.6 million per person. In a series of two papers, we recently
published accelerated longitudinal decline of memory and hippocampal volume in middle-age and older adults
(MA+) with ASD, compared to matched controls. This adds to our cross-sectional findings of decreased
hippocampal functional connectivity and increased free-water. Free-water is a relatively novel microstructural
diffusion tensor imaging technique that is more sensitive than conventional MRI metrics for detecting
neurodegeneration. Our recent paper shows baseline hippocampal free-water is a stronger correlate of
memory decline in our MA+ ASD than hippocampal volume. For functional MRI (fMRI), it is notoriously difficult
to efficiently elicit strong hippocampal activation. Nevertheless, altered hippocampal activity and connectivity
have been found in adults with ASD. We developed a relatively brief visuospatial fMRI memory task and our
preliminary data show strong single subject MA+ ASD hippocampal signal. We will add this novel task and an
established verbal memory task to our ongoing longitudinal MA+ ASD study. We will link fMRI data with
structural MRI measures using our novel multi-modal analysis methods to identify patterns that best predict
accelerated memory decline. Our long-term goal is identifying biomarkers and intervention targets for
precision medicine care of aging autistic adults. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize hippocampal and
memory aging trajectories in MA+ ASD, compared to matched NT adults, and 2) identify the combination of
MRI measures that best predict accelerated memory decline in MA+ ASD, compared to matched NT. Our
study design will use our ongoing, well-characterized longitudinal cohort of MA+ ASD (n=62) and NT (n=61)
who undergo cognitive batteries and multi-modal MRI scans every two-years (ages 40-75, mean=55.2 years;
M:F ratio 1.6:1; 1-4 timepoints). Our analysis approach will be a combination of hypothesis-driven, longitudinal
multi-level models with hippocampal and memory scores of interest longitudinal, and exploratory whole-brain
longitudinal and multi-modal partial least squares analyses. Our expected outcome is to lay the groundwork
for: 1) multi-modal MRI biomarker development that can be used to predict cognitive aging outcomes, and 2)
identifying targets for neuromodulation or other interventions. This is relevant to public health because
findings will advance fundamental knowledge of brain aging vulnerabilities and mechanisms in MA+ ASD. This
will lay the groundwork for precision medicine advances at the intersection of neuro-developmental conditions
and cognitive aging, and serve as a model for other developmental conditions (e.g. Attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, Cerebral Palsy)."
10801843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Half of the man-made radiation exposure to the U.S. population can be attributed to CT. Thus, stakeholders
have invested heavily in the reduction of CT doses. Recently, CT Deep Learning Reconstruction or Denoising
(DLRD) techniques have become available that claim to enable dose reduction in CT, just as CT iterative
reconstruction (IR) claimed before it. Like DLRD, IR showed dramatic apparent increases in image quality by
reducing image noise. Subsequent clinical studies found that true dose reductions capabilities for IR were only
20-25% in soft tissues and organs. Greater dose reductions resulted in compromised signal detectability for
low-contrast lesions (e.g., liver metastases). Now, DLRD algorithms are being used in clinical practice and
appear to yield image quality superior to IR. But again, we are finding that excessive radiation dose reduction
can introduce new artifacts and compromise lesion detectability. Our overall objective is to develop and
validate methods that can quantitatively determine CT protocols that deliver the needed diagnostic
performance at the lowest patient dose for any scanner model or reconstruction algorithm.
 In our first two competitive award periods, we developed robust Channelized Hotelling model observers
(MOs) to quantify diagnostic performance using low contrast objects within a uniform phantom and validated
the work with large scale reader studies for both filtered back projection and IR images. We are deploying
these tools under EB028936 to allow robust dose optimization by CT users. However, there remain challenges.
First, low-contrast phantoms used with most MOs are too simple. Second, highly realistic lesion and noise
insertion tools require use of proprietary projection data and access to manufacturer software tools. Third, MOs
must be extended to work with DLRD methods and be generalizable to any scanner. The proposed work will
use patient image data, obviating the need for projection data, use our developed deep learning (DL)-MOs to
achieve a scalable solution for performance assessment, and be generalizable to any algorithm or scanner.
 The goal of this renewal application is to develop robust DL-MO tools to efficiently predict diagnostic
performance for images created with DLRD methods. We will accomplish this through three specific aims:
1. Develop and validate disease-insertion and low-dose-simulation tools for CT DLRD techniques.
2. Develop and validate DL-MO tools to quantify mean diagnostic performance for DLRD methods.
3. Extend DL-MO methods to estimate performance variations across readers.
 This work is the first to develop and use DL-MOs as accurate and efficient surrogates of human readers to
characterize task-specific performance of DLRD methods in CT using patient images. The resultant performance
assessment engine will facilitate training / testing of DL-based noise reduction algorithms and optimizing CT
protocols and doses. These significant capabilities will ensure that diagnostic performance and the lifesaving
diagnostic information obtained from CT are not compromised in DLRD-processed images."
10933520,"Project Summary
Salient sensory events can elevate the arousal level, increasing the subject's readiness to engage motor,
cognitive and attentional resources. For example, arousal is increased when a sleeping person is shaken awake,
or when a quiescent rat is transferred to a new cage or otherwise handled. Recent evidence shows that the
dopamine projection from the midbrain ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core serves to
elevate arousal in response to such events, and that this effect likely involves both D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-
expressing NAc neurons. Yet, this role for mesolimbic circuitry in arousal has not been reconciled with the large
literature that interprets the behavioral effects of NAc dopamine manipulations as the result of altered motivation
or reward. To investigate how arousal might contribute to the reward-seeking effects of dopamine, we first
established a behavioral paradigm in which rats' performance of a cued operant task declines over time due to
gradually decreasing arousal. We find that simply handling the animal for a few seconds dramatically restores
high levels of performance for many minutes. Handling also increases dopamine levels in the NAc and the firing
response of NAc neurons to reward-predictive cues, which are known to be dopamine-dependent and causal to
the cued reward-seeking behavioral response. These results suggest that the dopamine increase caused by
arousing events facilitates reward seeking. This is one of the major hypotheses tested in this proposal.
This hypothesis suggests an even more provocative idea: that NAc dopamine promotes reward seeking by
increasing arousal. If that were the case, then dopamine should act via the same local circuit mechanism within
the NAc to increase both arousal and reward seeking. Previous studies point towards (but do not conclusively
demonstrate) a specific circuit mechanism common to both processes: D1 neurons are the “effector” neurons
whose firing drives both arousal and reward seeking, whereas D2 neurons strongly inhibit D1 neurons. Dopamine
promotes arousal and reward seeking primarily by acting at the D2 receptor to reduce the inhibitory drive from
D2 neurons onto D1 neurons, and only secondarily (if at all) by directly increasing the excitability of D1 neurons
by acting at the D1 receptor. This circuit model receives a great deal of indirect support from disparate published
experiments, as well as our pilot experiments, that have tested individual components of the model in isolation
from the others. In this proposal, we aim to test the model cohesively and thoroughly, and in doing so, to establish
that dopamine increases both arousal and reward seeking by the same local NAc circuit mechanism. Doing so
will reframe current thinking regarding the behavioral role of mesolimbic dopamine in two ways; first, by
establishing the causal contribution of D2 neurons' inhibition of D1 neurons (and the relief of this inhibition by
dopamine) to both arousal and reward seeking; and second, by showing that dopamine facilitates arousal and
reward seeking via the same local circuit mechanism – which will introduce the field to the hypothesis that
dopamine's well-known ability to promote reward seeking could be due in part to increased arousal."

The chromatin landscape governs basic cellular functions that are altered in cancer, including
genomic architecture, gene expression, and developmental pathways. Interestingly, epigenetic dysregulation of
chromatin is an emerging hallmark of cancer. These epigenetic changes in turn render cancer cells highly reliant
on the chromatin machinery to maintain their malignant state, thus creating opportunities for therapeutic
intervention by targeting chromatin modifiers. Driven by the desire to understand the basic mechanistic
underpinnings of epigenetic regulation, it is my goal to address pressing questions in molecular biology and
contribute to the advancement of cancer prevention and treatment. Histone post-translational modifications
(PTMs) are central regulators of chromatin processes, and genes encoding chromatin factors are highly mutated
in a range of cancers. This project seeks to understand the role of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)
in cancer development. PRC2 is a major epigenetic machinery responsible for the maintenance of
heterochromatin and catalysis of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation.
 The F99 phase of this proposal is focused on investigating the regulation of PRC2 enzymatic activity by
the highly conserved SANT1-like binding (SBD) domain of its EZH2 subunit. Despite the broad understanding
of PRC2 function and regulation, the molecular role of the N-terminal SBD of EZH2 is unknown. The
preliminary data reveals novel mechanistic insight about this domain in the catalysis of H3K27 methylation.
Surprisingly, partial deletion of the SBD domain in EZH2 (SBD-EZH2) leads to a global loss of repressive
H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, phenocopying the complete loss of EZH2 at the epigenomic level. In the
remainder of the dissertation work, my main research efforts will be directed toward delineating the regulatory
significance of the EZH2-SBD domain in the allosteric activation of PRC2 enzymatic activity, as well as
determining a potential inhibitory mechanism for lymphoma patients harboring EZH2 gain-of-function mutations.
 The K00 phase of this project will be focused on studying the role of PRC2 loss in the development of
the highly aggressive malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Interestingly, the loss of PRC2
components is involved in the malignant formation of sporadic and radiotherapy-associated MPNSTs. Thus, to
further understand the molecular mechanisms of these tumors, I plan to expand my technical expertise to include
high-throughput genetic screening, single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic techniques, computational
approaches, development of preclinical cancer models, and sequencing analysis of human tumor data. These
new approaches, coupled with my already strong background in molecular biology, microscopy, and
biochemistry, will allow me to address the most pressing and challenging issues in epigenetic regulation and
cancer biology today. This award will allow to pursue the above questions and and gain experience in order to
become a leader of my own cancer-focused group and a leader in the field of epigenetics."
10800841,"Mild TBIs are prevalent among professional athletes engaged in contact sports and military personnel. Repetitive
injuries induce cumulative adverse effects which may continue for many years after the original injury, with
trauma representing one of the strongest environmental risk factors for developing neurodegenerative disorders,
such as Alzheimer’s disease. TBI patients often develop long-lasting traumatic axonal injury, loss of myelin
sheath, and inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation, which contribute to motor, cognitive, behavioral, and
psychiatric deficits. However, no effective treatment is currently available for TBI-related pathogenesis.
Oxidative stress has been implicated as a driver of mTBI-induced brain damage. It is established that NADPH
oxidase (NOX) activity is maximal at a more alkaline pHi, and Na/H exchanger isoform 1 protein (NHE1) -
mediated H+ efflux in exchange of Na+ influx is responsible for maintaining more alkaline pHi for the sustained
NOX activity, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokine release. In our newly established mouse
closed-skull repetitive-mild TBI model (r-mTBI) by the controlled cortical impact (CCI), we found that r-mTBI
stimulated robust elevation of NHE1 protein in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, oligodendrocytes in the cortex,
corpus callosum, and hippocampus (Prelim data), which is concurrent with activation of reactive astrocytes and
microglial cells as well as pathological accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons (Prelim
data). Whether NHE1 protein upregulation plays a causal role in r-mTBI-induced axonal damage,
neuroinflammation, or cognitive function impairment is unknown. Interestingly, we observed that post-TBI
administration of the NHE1 protein inhibitor HOE642 attenuated neurological function declines in wild-type mice.
These findings led us to hypothesize that overstimulation of NHE1 protein may play a role in r-mTBI-mediated
axonal injury and neuroinflammation. In this renewal application, we set out to investigate underlying cellular and
molecular mechanisms with the following aims: Aim 1. Investigate whether r-mTBI-mediated upregulation of
NHE1 protein in mice stimulates NOX activity, ROS and proinflammatory cytokine formation in neurons and glial
cells. Aim 2. Investigate that NHE1 protein-mediated H+ efflux in neurons is involved in axonal transport
dysregulation through activation of cofilin-actin rod formation after r-mTBI. Aim 3. Investigate efficacy of post-TBI
administration of NHE1 pharmacological inhibitors (HOE642 and Rimeporide) in reducing axonal damage,
inflammation, and neurological functional deficits in r-mTBI mice. In summary, completion of this project will enable
us to gain new knowledge about the underlying cellular mechanisms for r-mTBI-induced pathogenesis. The
combined approaches with the Cre-loxP mouse line and post-TBI pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 function will
reveal therapeutic potentials of targeting NOX and/or NHE1 protein for reducing inflammation, axonal damage, and
improving neuronal function after concussion TBI."

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector has emerged as one of the preferred gene delivery
vehicles in clinical gene therapy. To date, three rAAV-based drugs, Luxturna, Zolgensma, and Roctavian have
been approved by the US FDA for treatment of an inherited blindness (RPE65 deficient), spinal muscular
atrophy, and severe hemophilia A, respectively. In addition, over 250 clinical trials of human gene therapy
using rAAV vectors have been carried out or are ongoing and have yielded inspiring outcomes. However, there
remain many barriers from vector binding, entry, intracellular trafficking, nuclear import, to gene expression to
be resolved, in particular, the mechanism of the receptor-mediated entry and intracellular trafficking. Different
rAAV vectors use different glycans as the primary attachment receptors for vector binding and a proteinaceous
receptor for vector entry of cells. KIAA0319L, a type I transmembrane protein, has been identified as a multi-
serotype AAV receptor involved in transduction of rAAV1-3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. It directly binds to rAAV vector in
vitro, and an anti-KIAA0319L antibody or purified recombinant extracellular domains of KIAA0319L efficiently
block rAAV transduction. However, the physiological function of KIAA0319L remains elusive. We identified
KIAA0319L is both N- and O-glycosylated and is the bona fide 150-kDa AAV2 binding protein that has been
previously identified. Its glycosylation does not contribute to the binding and transduction of rAAV vectors.
Biochemically, unlike its closely related protein KIAA0319, KIAA0319L per se is not homodimerized, but likely
heterodimerized. Swapping of the KIAA0319L PDK2 domain to KIAA0319 confers KIAA0319 to mediate rAAV2
transduction at the same efficiency as KIAA0319L. Notably, KIAA0319 is endocytosed through a clathrin-
dependent endocytosis pathway in a homodimer format; however, KIAA0319L is dynamically recycled from the
plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Therefore, we hypothesize that KIAA0319L interacts with
cellular membrane proteins to form a heterodimer that directs the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of
rAAV towards the TGN retrograde transport pathway. This proposal is aimed at identifying the KIAA0319L-
heterodimerized partner(s), and the endocytic vesicles to the TGN pathway mediated by the heterodimer. Our
long-term goal is to identify steps that limit rAAV transduction and that can be altered, and, therefore, can be
used to enhance rAAV transduction. The basic characterization of the KIAA0319L protein is the first step on
the road towards understanding the role that KIAA0319L plays as a multi-serotype AAV receptor, and also to
determine the role of KIAA039L-interatcing protein(s) which may function as a co-receptor and mediate unique
tropism of different AAV capsids to cells and tissues."

year survival rates to ~70%, the tradeoff is serious morbidities, including irreversible neurologic and intellectual
damage and the development of secondary malignancies, which reduce the overall quality of life and future
academic success of MB survivors. Therefore, new methods for safer therapy of MB are still needed to reduce
morbidity and improve the quality of life of MB survivors. To address this need, we will utilize a self-assembled
nanomaterial platform (SAE) with cancer-specific accumulation that our group has recently developed.
Specifically, SAE is a short self-assembling peptide conjugated with Indocyanine Green (ICG) and a Gadolinium
(Gd) complex for near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and MRI contrast, respectively. In addition, this multifunctional
nanomaterial platform locally generates toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when activated using low-
intensity ultrasound (i.e., sonodynamic therapy, SDT). In the preliminary experiments, we showed that SAE
strongly accumulated in a rat glioblastoma (GBM) model with ~70% cancer cell positivity and extended retention
time (>7 days) through LDL-receptor-mediated transcytosis and uptake. Based on these strong preliminary data,
we hypothesize that SAE can be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulate in MB tumors.
Upon MB-specific accumulation, this multifunctional nanomaterial will enable MRI diagnosis of MB tumors and
pre-operative planning, NIR fluorescence image-guided surgery, intraoperative MRI to ensure maximal tumor
resection, and intraoperative SDT to eliminate residual disease. Importantly, this broad functionality will be
achieved using a simple, biocompatible peptide conjugated with two FDA-approved contrast agents (ICG and
Gd), which will work synergistically to achieve these functions. In the preclinical studies proposed here, we will
validate this multifunctional nanomaterial platform in the detection and therapy of MB tumors. In addition, BBB
crossing and cancer cell internalization mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and toxicity of SAE will
be studied using various in vitro and in vivo models. The successful completion of these preclinical studies will
generate strong preliminary data for further evaluation of this multifunctional nanomaterial platform in more
detailed in vivo studies and early-phase clinical trials, which will be pursued in future R01 submissions.
Translating this technology to the clinic would be transformative in managing MB by significantly reducing
morbidities associated with surgery and CRT of MB tumors."

 Anopheles stephensi, a highly competent vector of urban malaria parasites, is rapidly spreading
across the globe. The ability of this mosquito to thrive in urban environments distinguishes it from other
primary malaria vectors that inhabit rural areas, making it a significant threat to millions of people who live in
cities. The long-term goal of our research program is to combat mosquitoes through the transfer of eco-
friendly RNAi-based mosquito gene silencing from the bench to the field. The objective of the proposed
research program is to evaluate the potential for RNAi yeast-based technologies to facilitate the control of A.
stephensi. These innovative new yeast insecticides have not yet been assessed in this dangerous mosquito.
The proposed investigation will test the hypothesis, which is supported by strong preliminary data, that
interfering RNA produced and delivered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be utilized as insecticidal agents
targeting A. stephensi. The specific aims are to 1) evaluate RNAi-based yeast attractive targeted sugar baits
(ATSBs) for control of A. stephensi, 2) identify RNAi yeast formulations that can be used to target A.
stephensi larvae, and 3) develop and assess A. stephensi female-specific RNAi yeast larvicides to facilitate
male sex-sorting. The aims will be pursued through a combination of laboratory and semi-field insecticide
trials that are designed to achieve the expected outcome of identifying a new class of RNAi yeast-based
insecticides to facilitate A. stephensi control. Moreover, the identification of female-specific larvicides will
permit the design of an RNAi yeast-based mass rearing diet for the production of fit adult males that can be
deployed in emerging population-based A. stephensi control programs. These innovative new RNAi tools will
help silence the threat of deadly A. stephensi mosquitoes."
10789027,"Obesity incidence is increasing worldwide with the urgent need to identify new therapeutics.
Increased adiposity is associated with chronic inflammation, which can exacerbate a number of
obesity-associated diseases, including COVID-19 infection and allergic disease. There are
profound sex differences in immune cell activation driving obesity-mediated pathologies.
However, there remain critical gaps in knowledge on the immune mechanisms underlying
obesity, and whether they are sexually dimorphic. Preliminary data generated from transgenic
mice, adoptive immune cell transfer, and adipose single cell sequencing uncovered a new
RELMα-eosinophil-macrophage axis that is female-specific and protective in obesity and
associated inflammation. Transcriptomic profiling of the adipose macrophages identified novel
sex-specific and RELMα-dependent genes such as chemokines, hemoglobins and a long non-
coding RNA (lncRNA) as new molecular candidates to treat obesity. Based on these findings,
the overarching goal of this study is to investigate sexual dimorphism in innate immune cell
crosstalk in obesity, from how gonadal hormones direct macrophage-eosinophil interaction (Aim
1) to determining downstream effectors in macrophages, such as hemoglobins and lncRNA, and
their mechanisms of action associated with oxidative stress in the obese adipose tissues (Aim
2). Strengths of the proposed study include the multidisciplinary nature of the experimental
design, which combines the co-PIs expertise in reproductive endocrinology and innate immunity,
and the public health impact of investigating the understudied area of sex differences and how
they may guide more specific treatments for obesity and associated risks for infection and
allergic disease."

Developmental disabilities (DD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Down syndrome, Fragile X
syndrome, and other intellectual and developmental disabilities are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental
disorders that place considerable burden on individuals, families, and society. Although most research on DD
has focused on children, these conditions are life-long with few established treatments to support functioning in
adulthood. As a result, many adults with DD experience significant functional impairment represented by low
rates of employment, severe social dysfunction and isolation, and a limited ability to live independently and
experience autonomy in adult life. The development of interventions to improve adult functional outcomes in
social, employment, and independent living domains across DD has lagged far behind those developed for
children. A key factor limiting the development of treatments to improve adult functioning in DD is the lack of
validated assessments of functional outcome applicable to adulthood. Current studies either use measures
relevant to childhood with limited applicability to and treatment sensitivity in adults, or fail to assess this
important domain, greatly restricting knowledge on how adult functioning can be improved in DD. We have
shown in preliminary studies with adults with ASD that it is possible to develop measures of functional outcome
in adulthood that have greater validity and are more sensitive to treatment effects than existing measures
adapted from childhood. In response to this major gap in adult outcome measurement in DD and PAR-18-039,
“Outcome Measures for Use in Treatment Trials of Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities”,
this project proposes to use NIH PROMIS methods to develop and validate proxy- and self-report versions of
the Adult Functioning Scale (AFS) for assessing functional outcomes in social, employment, and independent
living domains in adults with DD. A pool of potential items will be generated based on our conceptual model,
functional outcome measures used in other populations, and input from expert and stakeholder panels. This
item pool will then be completed by two calibration samples: Proxy reporters (e.g., parents, clinicians, group
home staff) for 1000 adults with DD representative of the full range of verbal and intellectual functioning in DD
and 1000 self-reporting adults with DD (N = 500 with ASD, N = 500 with other DD). Advanced psychometric
analytics employing exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory models will be used
to create final calibrated item banks (and static short forms) of the AFS suitable for broad use in clinical trials
across heterogeneous DD. The reliability and validity of the AFS caregiver and self-report versions will be
examined in the calibration samples, along with a 4-week retest subsample (N = 200). Sensitivity to treatment-
related changes will be assessed in longitudinal intervention studies of inpatient and outpatient samples of
adults with DD. The results will validate the first measure of functional outcome for use in clinical trials in adult
DD and will pave the way for treatment advances to improve functioning in this underserved population."
10934539,"Project Summary
Language barriers in prehospital emergency care can deny patients live-saving clinical care and build distrust
with the emergency medical system. When non/limited English proficient (LEP) patients call 9-1-1, they are
more likely to experience delays, less likely to receive and perform pre-arrival instructions and more likely to
experience adverse health outcomes and unscheduled emergency department return visits than their English-
speaking counterparts. With 25 million LEP individuals in the United States we need a better understanding of
the gaps in prehospital emergency care and modify the system to promote health equity in care delivery.
In hospital and clinic settings, the gold standard for overcoming language barriers is the use of professional
interpreters, which has shown to improve care delivery, patient satisfaction and health outcomes. While over-
the-phone interpreter (OPI) use in the 9-1-1 Dispatch emergency setting can be critical to facilitating
assessment and pre-arrival instruction delivery, suboptimal utilization (over, under or delayed utilization of OPI)
can result in worsened outcomes. This may explain some of the disparities seen in research showing that 9-1-
1 calls with LEP callers more frequently result in triage errors, increased time to dispatching response, and that
pre-arrival instructions are often delayed and/or not performed by LEP callers.
 We propose a multi-method study, guided by the Feldman-Stewart et al. (2005) provider-patient
communication framework, to increase our understanding of the complex interaction between LEP callers,
dispatchers and interpreters during the first critical minutes of emergency care. This study has three aims and
one sub-aim:
 1) Identify call characteristics that are associated with use of OPI and associated communication and
 care delivery outcomes during real-life 9-1-1 calls with LEP callers.
 1a.) analyze three-way communication patterns between dispatcher, caller and OPI in a sample
 of Spanish and Chinese (i.e., Mandarin/Cantonese) 9-1-1 calls with OPI.
 2) Identify key dispatcher attributes associated with use of and time to OPI during simulated scenarios
 (developed based on information collected in Aim#1), with LEP Spanish and Chinese mock callers.
 3) Translate and disseminate the results of the study via training opportunities and policy
 recommendations identified by emergency medical services (EMS) and community stakeholders, using
 a participatory Delphi technique.
Our research group has contributed significantly to the existing research on linguistic inequities in prehospital
care. We bring our vast knowledge of the complexity of communication in an emergency setting and a 30-year
history of collaborative work with EMS and community partners to shed light on OPI use in prehospital care
and guide translation of findings into policies and training on OPI use in prehospital care delivery."
10786837,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the U.S., accounting for approximately 1 in 5
cancer-related deaths. Approximately 80% of lung cancers are attributable to cigarette smoking. Annual Low-
Dose Computed Tomography screening for lung cancer (hereafter referred to as Lung Cancer Screening or LCS)
is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Despite evidence of effectiveness and
the USPSTF recommendations, implementation of LCS into clinical practice has been exceedingly limited, with
only 6.5% of eligible individuals screened in 2020, and there are major health inequities in LCS related to
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The long-term goal of this program of research is to increase the
reach of LCS at scale among low resource healthcare settings and populations that have been historically
marginalized. The proposed project, LungSMART Utah, is a two phase, Sequential Multiple Assignment
Randomized Trial (SMART) conducted in Utah Community Health Centers (CHCs). Utah has 14 CHC systems
with 50 primary care clinics. Each of the Utah CHCs are Federally Qualified Health Centers, providing
comprehensive primary care to >160,000 patients annually. Utah CHC patients are: 50% Latino, 8% Native
American, 38% best served in a language other than English, 61%<100% of federal poverty level, 45%
uninsured, and 41% of the clinics are in rural areas (RUCC >4). LungSMART Utah is guided by a
comprehensive conceptual framework and is designed to directly address LCS implementation challenges to
ensure equitable implementation and reduce health inequities. LungSMART Utah utilizes a Population Health
Management (PHM) framework, in which scalable, accessible, and sustainable telehealth interventions are
used to engage patients in LCS. Phase 1 of the SMART leverages ubiquitous technologies to enable CHC
patients to be assessed for LCS eligibility, engage in Shared Decision Making (SDM) if eligible, and be referred
for LCS. Phase 2 of the SMART tests telehealth interventions designed to address logistical barriers and
hesitancy around completing LCS among referred patients. LungSMART Utah leverages smartphone/internet
technologies when available, and also supports patients whose only telehealth connectivity is a cellphone. A
centralized “Hub” enables eligibility assessment, SDM with clinical decision support, screening referral, and
screening logistics assistance at scale to help overcome numerous social determinants of health that impact low
resource settings and historically marginalized populations. All study procedures and interventions will be
conducted in English or Spanish based on the patient's preferred language. In sum, LungSMART Utah will be
conducted in a real-world context across multiple, independent healthcare delivery systems with limited
resources (i.e., CHCs) and among historically marginalized populations (i.e., low SES, rural, Latino).
LungSMART Utah will provide a critical evidence-base for the large-scale implementation of interventions
designed to reduce health inequities in LCS at CHCs and other low resource settings nationwide."
10790133,"Abstract
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. Infections from
this pathogen have become more common and severe due to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains.
Neutrophils play a critical role in pulmonary bacterial clearance but an excessive pulmonary recruitment of
these cells leads to collateral lung damage, acute lung injury, and worse patient outcomes. The mechanisms
underlying an excessive neutrophil recruitment in bacterial pneumonia patients are poorly understood. We
have previously reported a critical role for leptin and its receptor (LepR) in neutrophil recruitment,
phagocytosis, bacterial killing and eicosanoids synthesis during bacterial pneumonia. A common LepR
polymorphism, (Q223R LepR) has been found in approximately 50% of the general population with no effects
on BMI. Homozygous expression of Arginine (R) at the 223 position (RR LepR) as compared with the ancestral
allele A, encoding for Glutamine Q, QQ or the heterozygous QR, of the extracellular domain of the LepR is
associated with worse outcomes in intra-abdominal E.histolytica, Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in
humans and mice and in patients with non-appendicular secondary peritonitis. Poor outcomes in CDIs were
associated with tissue and blood neutrophilia in humans and mice and enhanced leukocyte CXCR2 and Cd11b
expression, and elevated cytokines (IL-1ꞵ, IL-6, IFN-γ, MIF and TNF-α) in RR LepR mice. Excessive neutrophil
recruitment in RR LepR mice in CDI could be ameliorated by pretreating mice with a neutralizing antibody
against IL-1β, MIF or by blocking CXCR2.The impact of Q223R LepR mutation in host defense against
bacterial pneumonia is unknown. It is critically important to determine the impact of host genetic factors that
regulate neutrophil recruitment during bacterial infections since they might provide novel insights into
mechanisms of disease. The long-term goal is to determine the consequences of common leptin mutations in
host defense against pulmonary infections. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the impact of
the Q223R LepR polymorphism on the host response against Klebsiella pneumoniae in mice and in bacterial
pneumonia patients with the RR LepR mutation. Achieving these objectives will determine if the RR LepR
mutation has a negative impact on mechanisms of pulmonary host defense in mice, if this mutation is a risk
factor for more severe illness from bacterial pneumonia patients, and provide preliminary data for a subsequent
grant proposal. The central hypothesis is that the RR LepR mutation impairs host defense against Klebsiella
pneumonia by inducing an excessive pulmonary inflammatory response characterized by elevated blood and
lung neutrophils, higher lung injury, and greater mortality compared with QQ LepR mice. In patients with the
RR LepR mutation will have a more severe presentation of bacterial pneumonia and worse outcomes
compared with patients with the QQ or QR LepR genotype. The results of these experiments lend themselves
to translational medicine with the LepR signaling pathways as targets for therapy."

Antibody mediated immunity has long been considered irrelevant to the disease coccidioidomycosis (CM) – an
endemic fungal infection in the southwestern United States that can cause severe morbidity and mortality.
However, new evidence has revealed an important and previously unappreciated role for antibodies in other
fungal infections, suggesting that the prevailing paradigm is incomplete. Since antibodies are an attractive target
for diagnostics, an improved understanding of their potential in the setting of CM is crucial; but this remains a
significantly under-developed area of investigation. We hypothesize that antibodies play a role in CM disease
course and can inform the development of improved and rapid diagnostic assays. In this proposal, we will test
the following subsidiary hypotheses: 1), that there are undiscovered immunogenic protein targets within
the Coccidioides proteome; 2), that these antigenic targets will group into conserved antigen recognition
patterns across patients; and 3), that genomic analysis of B cells isolated from CM patients will identify
novel monoclonal antibodies which target known and previously unknown Coccidioides proteins. To test
these hypotheses, we propose to apply two innovative technologies; first we will identify novel CM antigens at
proteome-wide scale using PepSeq, a highly-multiplexed, epitope-resolved serological assay. Secondly, we will
combine newly-identified antigens with known antigens to build probesets for the multiplexed analysis of
100,000s of single B cells from CM patients. This will allow us to identify antigen/epitope-specific IgH/L chain
sequences and generate and validate a diverse panel of novel monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies will have
potential as therapeutic and/or diagnostic tools, to be developed in future studies."

The New England Regional Biosafety Laboratory (NERBL) was established in 2008 with the goal of ensuring
that research and tasks in response to pathogens of pandemic potential and other emerging infections
(PPP/EI) are safely, efficiently, and rigorously accomplished. The NERBL was also designed to serve as a
regional resource for academic and industry partners engaged in activities that yield knowledge and medical
countermeasures to PPP/EI and ready to serve as directed by NIH/NIAID/federal partners in whatever capacity
necessary for pandemic response. A critical element necessary for effective functioning of any
biosafety/biocontainment laboratory is the existence of core competencies associated with physical,
operational, regulatory and research (vivarium/laboratory) tasks frequently performed in this setting.
Individuals working in the context of biocontainment must possess advanced technical skills, have undergone
extensive BSL-3/ABSL-3 training, and continuously enhance their knowledge regarding agent specific risk.
Additionally, to maintain operational integrity of a biocontainment facility and adequately safeguard the staff,
environment, and local community, functional redundancies in these skills and associated responsibilities are
an absolute necessity. As such, the primary objective of this application is to expand and maintain a
footprint of highly qualified staff within the NERBL that possess a set of core competencies for
specific function categories (i.e., vivarium, facilities), while also cross-trained to undertake additional
responsibilities should the need arise. Accordingly, we have proposed three Cores within the context of this
application to achieve this overarching goal. Core 1 will oversee facility management, maintenance and
operations, ensuring integrity and sustainability of the NERBL infrastructure. Core 2 will entail activities that
cover BSL3/ABSL3 best practices, including laboratory specific biosafety, biosecurity education, vivarium
specific trainings and research competencies. Lastly, Core 3 will serve as the biocontainment research
support services core, expanding capacities for bacteriology, virology and vector biology. Core members will
undergo rigorous cross-training to create the functional redundancies necessary for ensuring continuity of
services. Together, these activities will allow us to fulfill our mission as a resource for Tufts University,
academic partners, industry entities, state/federal investigators, as well as for our RBL/NBL Network
members. Importantly, following completion of the stated milestones, the NERBL will be well-positioned and
sufficiently resourced to rapidly respond to future emerging infectious disease threats."

Up to 40% of patients report using cannabis for symptom management during and after cancer treatments
despite gaps in our understanding of its longitudinal therapeutic uses and harms. Simultaneously, immuno-
oncology is a rapidly advancing field of cancer treatment. Nearly 44% of cancer patients across 20 tumor types
receive treatments with immunotherapy, notably Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs), which can lead to
persistent changes in the immune system for months or even years. Given cannabis also has immunomodulatory
effects, there is a critical need to generate long-term data on the impact of cannabis use on longitudinal benefits
and harms, immune function, and disease progression in cancer patients treated with ICIs. This proposal builds
upon our existing program of research. Our team has conducted 4 NCI-funded projects regarding cannabis use
in cancer patients, including 3 large cross-sectional surveys of cannabis use among patients treated at 3 NCI
designated cancer centers. Across sites, 26% (n=831 of 3,169) of cancer patients reported using cannabis during
treatment. However, the rate was considerably higher among patients treated with immunotherapy (32%). The
overarching goal of this study is to advance the science regarding the longitudinal benefits and harms of
cannabis use among those treated with ICIs for cancer. We propose a multi-site, 12-month prospective cohort
study (N=450; 150 per site) with cancer patients treated with ICI (within 3 months): 225 cannabis users (regular
weekly use in the prior month) and 225 cannabis non-users (no use in the past 6 months). Cannabis use,
benefits, and harms will be assessed via ecological momentary assessment (collected 7 days/time point; 49
days total), patient reported outcomes will be assessed via online/phone surveys, and routine clinical data will
be extracted from electronic medical records. Among a subset of 60 patients who have not yet started ICI
treatment (30 cannabis users; 30 non-users), we will examine immunological markers (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, CRP)
at baseline (prior to starting ICI), 2, 6, & 12 months. The Specific Aims are to: 1) assess benefits (pain severity
& interference, sleep disturbance, anxiety, quality of life) and harms (difficulty concentrating, impaired memory,
dizziness, fatigue) of cannabis use over time; 2) test whether cannabis use over time moderates the associations
between neighborhood disadvantage (Area Deprivation Index) and benefits and harms in Aim 1; & 3) among a
subset of 60 patients with non-skin solid malignancies who have not yet started ICI, explore the association of
cannabis use with disease progression and immunological markers. This timely and comprehensive study, in
response to RFA-CA-22-052, will fill critical gaps in knowledge about longitudinal benefits and harms of cannabis
use in persons treated with ICIs. The strong multidisciplinary team brings the requisite expertise in cancer
symptom management, medical cannabis, health equity, oncology, immunology, and substance misuse. In
collaboration with other funded U01s and U24, this research will have a sustained impact on the science of
cancer symptom management and ultimately improve patient care and safety."

Conventional sintering (CS) protocols produce high quality zirconia restorations suitable for a wide range of
indications. However, CS requires a firing cycle of 4 – 10 h, a bottleneck in digital dental workflow precluding
zirconia from chairside applications. Current speed sintering (SS) protocols using fast heating (up to 6C/s) in
an induction furnace can reduce sintering times to 0.3 – 0.5 h. However, because of inefficiency of convective
heat transfer, leading to temperature inhomogeneity, SS produces microstructures with higher porosities, thus
compromising zirconia translucency and strength. In addition, non-uniform densification raises concerns about
chemical and dimensional stability, internal fit and marginal adaptation of restorations. As a result, SS is largely
limited to the fabrication of single-unit crowns from 4 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (4YSZ). Accordingly, the
long-term goal is to drastically increase sintering speed (on the order of 60 s) while maximizing mechanical and
optical properties of dental zirconia (exceeding those of the SS- and CS-YSZ) by implementing novel UFS
technologies. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) establish composition and time-temperature-
transformation (TTT) relationships to guide material selections for various industries and sectors, with special
attention to the optimization of strength and translucency of YSZ for dental applications; and (2) demonstrate
improved dimensional, long-term chemical and structural stabilities pertaining to the quality and longevity of
UFS-YSZ restorations relative to SS and CS. The central hypothesis is that novel UFS methodology will
dramatically increase time efficiency of digital workflow while optimizing zirconia properties and expanding the
range of indications for single-visit treatments. This hypothesis follows directly from preliminary results and a
state-of-the-art material science knowledge base. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue 3 specific aims: (1) To
characterize the properties of yttria stabilized zirconia using ultrafast sintering technology in conjunction with
high-throughput fail-fast screening; (2) To determine the resistance to low temperature degradation and fatigue
fracture of ultrafast sintered zirconia relative to current speed and conventional sintering; and (3) To evaluate
the dimensional stability, internal fit, and marginal adaptation of ultrafast sintered 3-unit fixed dental prostheses
relative to current speed and conventional sintering. The approach is innovative because it departs completely
from the current furnace-sintering concept by using Joule heating elements with more effective radiation and
conduction heat transfer. The proposed research is significant because it addresses current challenges in poor
material properties associated with SS and the long sintering time of CS. Such an approach will improve the
efficiency and accuracy of restorative procedures to provide more treatment options and better patient
experience, thus improving quality of life and reducing cost to the patient."

an affiliate of our LAPS, was the top enroller to NCTN trials nationally among VA hospitals for the first two
years of the award period. Winship has also leveraged its statewide partnerships with the Georgia National
Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) and the Georgia minority underserved NCORP to enhance
accruals to NCTN trials throughout Georgia. With an enthusiastic institutional commitment to its role in the
NCTN, Winship proposes the following specific aims for this application: 1) Expand its many leadership roles
within the NCTN and the network groups; 2) Enroll Winship patients onto a wide spectrum of NCTN trials,
emphasizing enrollment of historically under-represented minority patients; 3) Provide mentorship and
guidance to early career investigators for participation in the NCTN; and 4) Develop novel clinical trials in the
NCTN based on research ideas generated at Winship."

Despite the high prevalence of metabolic dysregulation among patients with asthma, precise mechanisms
driving airway inflammation in this population are not well-established. Glucocorticoids are a mainstay of
treatment for asthma but damage metabolic control, increasing morbidity, and driving healthcare costs.
Therefore, there is an urgent, unmet need to understand the role of metabolic pathways in asthma and the
effect of targeted therapies. This proposal aims to meet that need by examining the effects of targeting the
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) metabolic pathway in patients with asthma and metabolic
dysregulation. Increasing evidence supports that GLP-1R agonist (GLP-1RA) drugs reduce airway
inflammation. Preliminary preclinical data also support that GLP-1RAs reduce platelet activation and mediator
release, and clinically, GLP-1RAs decrease adverse cardiovascular events. Platelets are a shared source of
pro-inflammatory mediators in airway and metabolic disease not addressed by current asthma therapies.
Therefore, this proposal aims to test the hypothesis that augmenting the GLP-1 pathway with GLP-1RA
therapy impacts clinical asthma outcomes, mediated by platelet inflammation. The long-term objective is to
expand therapeutic options for patients in need of glucocorticoid-sparing interventions. Specifically, the
proposed aims will 1) evaluate the impact of platelet activation on asthma exacerbations in patients with
asthma and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) using an electronic health record-linked Biobank; 2) prospectively
examine the effect of GLP-1RA initiation on clinical measures of airway inflammation in patients with asthma
and T2DM receiving routine outpatient diabetes care; and 3) determine the impact of baseline platelet
activation on clinical response to GLP-1RA treatment in patients with asthma and obesity, leveraging data from
a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial by our collaborator Dr. Katherine Cahill. These aims directly align
with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s core scientific mission to support research that improves
asthma treatment options, and additionally address the health consequences of the increasing prevalence of
T2DM and obesity for the asthma population. The specific aims complement a robust training agenda for the
candidate to prepare for independence and are aligned with rigorous, hands-on coursework in diabetes and
metabolism, clinical study design, biostatistical analysis, and practical bioinformatics methods for clinical
research, within the exceptional scientific environment at the Mass General Brigham health system and

and functional assessments (Dr. Hans Clevers/Dr. Edward Nieuwenhuis), data analysis/network development
(Dr. Eric Schadt) and data sharing (Dr. Larsson Omberg/Sage Bionetwoks). To generate a VEOIBD cellular and
molecular atlas, our goal is to pursue in VEOIBD patients a multi-omic approach to generate in-depth patient-
specific libraries of data including: 1) single cell and bulk transcriptomic and proteomic data generation from
biopsies; 2) paired single cell and bulk transcriptomics and proteomics from patient-derived organoids; 3) paired
transcriptomics, and proteomics from patient blood. To further inform upon this data set, we will couple these
data with deep immune phenotyping (through mass cytometry) and functional characterization of VEOIBD
patient-derived organoids. In this application, we propose to study 150-200 VEOIBD patients (< 6 years) and 30-
40 age-matched controls employing bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics from biopsies and
paired peripheral blood samples. In addition, we will perform deep immune phenotyping on intestinal biopsies
(75-100 patients; 15-20 controls) with paired peripheral blood, as well as organoid development coupled with
bulk and single cell RNA sequencing and functional assessments on 100-150 VEOIBD patients and 20-30
controls. The multitude of cell types in the intestine contributing to disease pathology has to date been mostly
studied in aggregate form. In order to deconvolute the cell specific signal within the tissue and ‘assign’ disease
relevance, we will apply our multiscale network (MultiNet) approaches in combination with single cell omics
technology. Based on the above data sets, we will validate novel VEOIBD causal gene variants which will not
only lead to a better understanding of the disease for these patients but also enhance the development of the
VEOIBD immune atlas and epithelial signature and associated networks. Importantly, we will share these
libraries of data and organoids with the scientific community to accelerate our mission of identifying therapeutic
targets, and cures for VEOIBD."

The mechanical stability of the cornea supports visual acuity by maintaining corneal curvature, with
important implications for refractive surgery and the management of cornea ectasia. However, clinical
options for mechanical characterization are limited, particularly when compared to well-established tools
for morphological characterization of the cornea. Several commercial and investigational instruments have
highlighted the potential value of corneal biomechanical analysis, but these devices have limited accuracy
and cannot fully characterize the anisotropic, nonlinear, and spatially varying elastic stiffness of the cornea.
The overarching goal of this project is to develop advanced optical coherence elastography (OCE) for
comprehensive characterization of corneal biomechanics. The proposed technology harnesses both
extensional and flexural elastic waves guided along the cornea to measure in-plane tensile (Young’s) and
shear moduli at mm-scale resolution. The first specific aim is to develop an OCE system using non-contact
ultrasound transducers optimized to excite both elastic waves efficiently at high frequencies spanning 4-
10 kHz. The second specific aim is to test this OCE system with healthy subjects and investigate the
dependence of tensile and shear moduli on age and intraocular pressure in vivo. The third specific aim is
to measure tensile and shear moduli in patients diagnosed with keratoconus and to monitor mechanical
changes after corneal crosslinking treatment. The fourth specific aim is to analyze changes in the moduli
as a result of different corneal refractive surgeries. Various ex vivo measurements and finite-element
modeling studies will also be undertaken in order to interpret the clinical data and relate the measured
moduli to the microstructure of the cornea. This project will advance our understanding of corneal
biomechanics in relation to various natural, pathological, and interventional processes and may lead to a
new clinical tool that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of keratoconus, the safety and visual
outcome of refractive surgery, and the accuracy of tonometry."

Although evidence-based cancer screening protocols exist for several common cancer types, an estimated
70% of cancer deaths are due to cancers for which no early detection test is yet available. Multi-cancer early
detection tests (MCDs) seek to fill this gap using advances in cell-free DNA detection to identify multiple cancer
types from a single blood draw. This new approach to cancer screening has the potential to revolutionize early
detection and reduce cancer mortality. MCDs are rapidly moving toward general commercial availability, and
studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the risks and benefits associated with these tests
and how best to implement them appropriately and effectively. To address these gaps the National Cancer
Institute seeks to create the Cancer Screening Research Network (CSRN). At the University of North Carolina
Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, we have formed a multi-disciplinary team that is highly qualified
and eager to join the NCI CSRN as the CSRN North Carolina Hub (CSRN NC Hub). Our extensive research
experience in cancer screening trials and NCI clinical trials infrastructure, and our screening research
affiliations both with UNC Health, our statewide health system, and with Federally Qualified Health Centers
(FQHCs), demonstrates our capacity to enroll historically underrepresented communities including specifically
Black, Hispanic, and American Indian populations. Our overarching aim is to accelerate research on emerging
cancer screening technologies in partnership with the CSRN. In this application, we propose to (1) establish
CSRN NC Hub infrastructure and linkages to build capacity for future, larger studies of MCDs and other novel
cancer screening tests; (2) enroll a diverse patient population and conduct the Vanguard feasibility trial; and (3)
conduct preliminary qualitative research to elicit perspectives of diverse communities regarding MCD
screening. We will build a population-based, racially diverse recruitment hub in North Carolina that leverages
the geographic and demographic diversity of the state. For the Vanguard trial, we will enroll 2000 participants
from two selected UNC Health sites and one FQHC, using a mix of innovative recruitment and retention
methods demonstrated to be effective in our prior studies. Based on past experience, we believe the CSRN
NC Hub is exceptionally well-positioned to support the critical CSRN goal of recruiting a diverse screening-
eligible population representative of the racial, ethnic, and rural/urban distribution of both NC and the US. As
part of the CSRN, the NC ACCESS Hub will significantly contribute to the rapid evaluation of emerging cancer
screening technologies and future studies of MCDs and other novel screening technologies that will yield high
quality evidence to inform the use of these tests in clinical practice across diverse US populations."

Caries is one of the most prevalent oral diseases. Despite several decades of substantial caries
research, only incremental progress has been made in disease prevention. Caries is the result of
polymicrobial dysbiosis and not curable since the tooth structure is destroyed by fermentative acid
by-products from caries-associated bacterial species. Therefore, strong emphasis should be on
caries prevention. Caries risk assessment (CRA) is a widely accepted approach to caries
prevention, but has been criticized because it leads to patients with increased risk not being
identified. One drawback of CRA is that the polymicrobial nature of caries is not considered.
Furthermore, it lacks any molecular markers sampled directly at the tooth surface where caries
occurs. A key to improved CRA and prevention is a better understanding of molecular
mechanisms that promote oral commensals associated with general oral health. We have
identified an important trait of commensal oral streptococci that promotes molecular
commensalism: the pyruvate oxidase, SpxB, provides a growth advantage under aerobic
conditions since its metabolic activity generates additional ATP as well as pathogen-inhibiting
H2O2. SpxB therefore enables early commensal streptococci to outgrow and inhibit
H2O2 susceptible and caries-associated species. Our hypothesis is that commensal streptococci
producing higher amounts of metabolically important ATP and inhibitory H2O2 are more
competitive and thus allow dental plaque to be more resistant to cariogenic dysbiosis. We
therefore propose the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Cellular context - molecular mechanisms determining differential H2O2 production.
Aim 2: Oral context - determine whether spxB regulation influences competitiveness in vivo.
Aim 3: Clinical context - Real time measurements of H2O2 production and spxB expression
from ex vivo dental plaques.
The proposed aims will support our overall goal to better understand the health-associated traits
of oral commensals and lead to a paradigm shift in caries research towards that of molecular
commensalism; a vastly understudied area of oral microbiology. The gained
knowledge will provide important new insight into the development of new strategies to prevent
oral diseases like caries."

 There is evidence that physical activity and exercise benefit the brain, but the mechanisms for this
benefit are unclear. The chronic benefits of exercise are likely a product of discreet, acute responses in
exercise-related blood biomarkers and brain metabolism. This acute exercise response has not been
compared in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). It is known that acute exercise elicits a powerful peripheral
response in young cohorts, and exercise-related biomarkers such as glucose and lactate readily penetrate the
brain. Thus, studies of these effects in aged and AD individuals are needed. It is critical to characterize and
understand the acute effects of exercise, including different exercise intensities, in terms of the peripheral
metabolic response and relationship with brain metabolism. This will help determine potential mechanisms for
brain benefits of exercise and better inform the design of future clinical trials. Our primary goal is to
characterize the acute exercise response of brain glucose metabolism and exercise-related blood biomarkers.
We will characterize the brain metabolic response to an acute bout of moderate and higher intensity exercise
and characterize the extent to which this differs between nondemented (ND) elderly and AD individuals.
Related to this primary goal, we will quantify the peripheral biomarker response to moderate and higher
intensity exercise and how this relates to brain metabolic change in both groups. We will implore a rigorous
experimental design, with tightly controlled timings. We will generate a timecourse of blood draws prior to,
during, and following exercise in ND and AD subjects to explore disease-related differences. We will focus on a
specific exercise biomarker, lactate, but we will also characterize a wider panel of exercise-related biomarkers.
We will expand on our exercise studies by leveraging a lactate clamp procedure, where we can characterize
differences in lactate uptake and use (turnover) between diagnosis groups. By using stable isotopes, the
lactate clamp will allow us to simultaneously examine complex dynamics of energy metabolism, such as lactate
appearance, disappearance, and oxidation, and evaluate if AD subjects use this key metabolite differently. It
also allows characterization of acute effects of lactate on cognition in the absence of other exercise effects.
Taken together, these studies will allow us to elucidate the relationship between quantifiable blood biomarkers
and brain acute response to exercise, and how exercise intensity may be important. Through in-depth
characterization of these physiological responses in aging and AD, we will obtain important information
regarding how relatively non-invasive outcomes, such as heart rate and blood biomarker response, relate to a
key brain outcome measure (cerebral glucose metabolism). By characterizing thresholds for response of
biomarkers that are needed to elicit acute brain changes, this could provide insight for the design of future
long-term exercise intervention studies that are most likely to benefit the brain (i.e. moderate vs. higher
intensity exercise, characteristics of participants who respond, etc) to maximize target engagement."
10799553,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Approximately 70% of invasive breast cancer expresses estrogen receptor-alpha (ER). Our lab and others
have found that 50-60% of early-stage ER+ breast cancers also express glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and that
high GR expression provides favorable prognostic information in early-stage breast cancer independently of
PR expression. Specifically, in an analysis of primary tumor GR expression in ER+ invasive breast tumors from
over 1000 ER+ early-stage patients with >20 year clinical follow-up, we discovered that high tumor GR mRNA
expression (and by implication, high GR activity) was associated with a significantly lower risk of relapse. More
recently, we found that in ER+ breast cancer cell line models, GR activation remodels chromatin so that ER-
chromatin association and ER-target gene expression are significantly altered. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that ER and GR can provide coordinated regulation of good prognosis, anti-proliferative and pro-
differentiation genes. We propose to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying GR-mediated
modulation of both wild-type and mutant ER transcriptional activity, and to define the specific patterns of
ER/GR-mediated gene expression in breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will characterize how GR ligand binding
domain activation [by either dexamethasone (dex) or novel selective GR modulators (SGRMs)] affects ER
activity, consequent ER-mediated gene expression, and ultimately ER-associated tumor cell proliferation. In
Aim 2, we will investigate GR and ER chromatin and co-regulator association in the presence of dex in
comparison to the novel SGRMs. This will allow us to better understand the requirements of chromatin
conformation and GR/ER co-regulator assembly in modifying ER+ breast cancer's proliferative gene
expression. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use in vivo ER+ breast cancer patient-derived xenograft models, mutant
ER-expressing cell lines, and tamoxifen-resistant ER+ models to define SGRM anti-tumor activity with the aim
of defining clinical contexts in which GR modulators are most likely to be effective. Together, these
experiments will both increase our understanding of GR/ER crosstalk in breast cancer (and possibly other
hormone-sensitive cancers e.g. endometrial) and are expected to lead to new GR-targeted therapies that
harness our discovery of anti-proliferative activity following GR modulation in ER+/GR+ breast cancer."
10799554,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical antigen presenting cells for initiating adaptive immune responses. Their
function depends on being positioned in sentinel locations at pathogen-exposed surfaces, and being present in

and 2. cDC2s are particularly important for supporting T follicular helper (Tfh) cell and Th2 cell generation and
are a focus of our efforts to broadly understand requirements for mounting antibody responses. In this
application we will study requirements for cDC2 positioning, homeostasis and function in spleen and lung.
 Very recently, we found that splenic cDC2 homeostasis was dependent on the G13-containing
heterotrimeric G-protein. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based screening, we found that the adhesion GPCR Adgre5
(CD97) functions upstream of G13 to promote splenic cDC2 positioning, homeostasis and function.
Importantly, we found that the presence of CD55, a CD97 ligand, on red blood cells (RBCs) was sufficient to
promote splenic cDC2 homeostasis. As an adhesion GPCR family member, CD97 is predicted to be
mechanosensitive. We hypothesize that the CD97-G13 signaling pathway is activated in splenic cDC2s
following encounter with CD55-expressing RBCs under conditions of shear stress. We speculate that this
pathway critically informs cDC2s of their positioning in blood-exposed regions of the spleen, sites that allow
encounter with systemic pathogens. In Aim 1 of this application we will characterize the domain requirements
of CD97 to support cDC2 homeostasis. Mechanosensing by CD97 will be studied and the role of key
transcription factors, including Mrtf and Irf4, in the CD97 pathway will be examined. Finally, the mechanism for
defective responses to TLR ligands in CD97-pathway mutant cDC2s will be characterized. In Aim 2 intravital
two photon microscopy of the spleen will be used to define how CD97 promotes cDC2 positioning and to study
the dynamics of cDC2 interaction with self and foreign RBCs. This work will define a new pathway acting in
cDC2s to support their antigen capture and presentation function during the initiation of antibody responses to
blood-borne antigens.
 In earlier work we discovered that EBI2 (GPR183) is a critical chemoattractant receptor in splenic
cDC2s, and loss of EBI2 leads to defective T cell-dependent antibody responses to blood borne antigens. We
also defined the cell types producing EBI2’s oxysterol ligands in lymphoid tissues. In new work we have
discovered that EBI2-deficiency leads to a marked reduction in cDC2s in the lung. In Aim 3 we will define the
role of EBI2 in positioning cDC2s within the lung and determine the cell types that serve as a source of
oxysterol ligands. The impact of EBI2 deficiency on the lung allergic response will be examined. Definition of a

10799691,"Project Summary/Abstract
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine and are placed high in the
“evidence pyramid”. When rigorously designed, conducted, and reported, they provide the most robust evidence
on effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. However, they commonly suffer from various types of biases (e.g.,
selection bias, attrition bias) in study design and execution. In reporting, key methodological characteristics such
as randomization and blinding are often omitted, making it difficult to assess the validity and applicability of trial
findings. Adherence to reporting guidelines can improve transparency and completeness of reporting for
biomedical studies. SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines help authors report RCT protocols and results
publications, respectively. Although endorsed by many high-impact medical journals, adherence to these
guidelines remains suboptimal, possibly because journals lack methods for enforcement and verification, which
involves a substantial amount of journal staff or editorial time. Furthermore, transparent reporting does not
guarantee methodological rigor. We hypothesize that natural language processing (NLP) methods underpinned
by SPIRIT/CONSORT guidelines as well as terminological and ontological resources for clinical research can
(a) improve compliance by locating key study characteristics in RCT reports and flagging their absence, and (b)
support automated rigor assessment and large-scale methodological research by extracting granular machine-
readable methodological information from RCT reports. To achieve these goals, we specifically aim to:
Aim 1. Create text classification models for assessing transparency and completeness of RCT reports consistent
with SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines.
Aim 2. Develop information extraction methods to identify methodological characteristics in RCT reports.
Aim 3. Build a web-based compliance tool that generates reports on transparency and guideline adherence of
RCT reports.
Aim 4. Generate structured transparency reports from published RCT literature for analysis of methodology and
reporting quality.
The proposed research will develop a set of models, resources, and tools that will assist stakeholders of clinical
research in maintaining high reporting standards, synthesizing evidence, and promoting open science practices.
They will contribute to improvements throughout the scientific ecosystem, leading to better clinical care and
health policy."

shared leadership of Madhukar H. Trivedi, MD of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)
Steven Shoptaw, PhD of UCLA, and Jennifer S. Potter, PhD, MPH, of UT Health Science Center at San
Antonio (UTHSCSA). This fourth competing renewal application builds on our successful track record of
leading CTN trials, being good network partners by providing excellent sites for multi-site studies, high
productivity in publishing, and training the next generation of scientists. During the 2015-2020 funding cycle,
our team developed and led: the largest pharmacotherapy trial for the treatment of methamphetamine use
disorder to date (extended-release naltrexone plus high-dose bupropion; CTN0068 ADAPT-2), an in-depth
study of the causes of death in a cohort of people living with HIV/HCV and substance use disorder
(CTN0064A1), and an implementation study to develop and deploy universal screening for opioid use disorder
and measurement based care using buprenorphine (CTN0090 MBC4OUD). Finally, a study testing transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a treatment for stimulant use disorder has been approved for development, in
collaboration with the Southern Consortium Node (CTN0108). For this renewal application, we capitalize on the
experience of the Multiple PIs, who collectively have expertise in the treatment of stimulants, the treatment of
and public health response to the opioid crisis, and the treatment and care of HIV. Additional investigators
bring content expertise spanning addiction science and clinical care, translational science, dissemination and
implementation science, informatics, and trial implementation. The expanded Big South/West Node is named
to denote the importance of including geographic regions in the South that have historically not been
represented within the CTN (i.e., Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana). This geographical expansion provides
greater access to diverse patient populations (e.g., diverse racial and ethnic groups; underinsured;
underserved; native [American Indian] and immigrant groups) within diverse settings (e.g., rural, urban). Our
existing partnerships with primary care networks, large health care systems, and use of electronic health
records (EHR) to positively impact substance use, has been further broadened to include multiple statewide
networks and resources in new partner states. Our research agenda includes a focus on the fourth wave of the
opioid epidemic, building upon the expertise of our investigators in treating stimulant and opioid use disorders,
and the changing needs of the regions we serve. Our team has experience with innovative study designs that
target all areas of the translational science continuum, and equip our Node to successfully and significantly

Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) is a devastating condition characterized by relentless lung
function decline and survival worse than most cancers. PF-ILD can complicate any ILD subtype and leads to
similarly poor survival irrespective of ILD etiology. The inability to predict PF-ILD drives treatment disparities and
remains a critical gap in knowledge in those with non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) forms of ILD. To improve
non-IPF ILD outcomes, tools to predict PF-ILD are urgently needed. By applying machine learning algorithms to
proteomic data, our group recently developed a preliminary proteomic signature to predict PF-ILD. While
promising, notable deficiencies prevented clinical implementation of this signature, including insufficient test
performance to justify clinical adoption and the imprecise nature of semi-quantitative data, which limits external
generalizability. This proposal aims to address these deficiencies, expand our understanding of PF-ILD and
conduct a comparative analysis of validated PF-ILD biomarkers. In aim 1, we will identify and validate semi-
quantitative proteomic biomarkers of PF-ILD, hypothesizing that unbiased proteomic investigation will identify
novel biomarkers of PF-ILD outcomes and new therapeutic targets. Biomarkers associated with one-year ILD
progression and three-year transplant free survival will be identified separately and validated in an independent
cohort from the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. Pathway and network analysis will be performed to identify key
biologic mediators of PF-ILD and identify new potential therapeutic targets. In aim 2, we will develop a high-
fidelity proteomic signature of PF-ILD using a custom, quantitative proteomic platform, which we hypothesize will
reliably predict one-year ILD progression when applied prospectively. Test performance characteristics for this
signature will be assessed in three prospectively recruited non-IPF ILD cohorts from the US and Canada. In aim
3, we will compare test performance between proteomic, genomic and radiologic biomarkers of PF-ILD,
hypothesizing that protein biomarkers will better predict near- and long-term ILD outcomes than genomic and
radiologic biomarkers in a prospectively recruited, multi-center non-IPF ILD cohort. Successful completion of this
proposal will identify novel biomarkers of PF-ILD that may one day serve as therapeutic targets and lay the
foundation for clinical implementation of a proteomic signature to predict PF-ILD. This proposal has high
potential to positively impact non-IPF ILD outcomes by allowing patients with PF-ILD to be identified earlier in
the disease course and receive prompt intervention to prevent progression."

The NIH All of Us (AoU) Research Program is a national research initiative launched by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) in May 2018 with the goal of advancing precision medicine,
which aims to provide personalized medical treatment and prevention strategies based on an

AoU typically requires creation of cohorts that are clinically similar with the exception of the
characteristic(s) being evaluated. If the creation of compared cohorts is not conducted with
care, results may be confounded by systematic difference in the characteristics of patients
assigned to the compared cohorts. This proposal, Similarity Matching In Longitudinal Electronic
Patient Data (SMILE PD), will apply a sophisticated patient matching algorithm within an easy-
to-use interface to help Investigators to create suitable analytical cohorts to enable generation of
accurate, reproducible real world evidence from the rich content of the All of Us data.
The project has 4 Aims :
 • Aim 1. Develop algorithms that learn patient similarities from AoU data in a
 comprehensive manner.
 • Aim 2: Develop approaches that can integrate drug and disease information from
 publicly available data sources to improve the quality of learned patient similarities.
 • Aim 3: Implement an interactive user interface to specify similarity matching criteria
 and demonstrate the learned patient similarities
 • Aim 4 : Apply the patient similarity matching algorithm and interface to conduct an
 initial assessment of the impact of mental illness and its treatment on chronic disease
outcomes
The patient similarity matching interface created through this proposal will enable investigators to
conduct predictive analytics, risk assessments and comparative effectiveness research in a more

10799413,"Title: Distinct functions of adipocyte-derived FGF21 in obesity
Summary
Obesity is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions, with an urgent need for novel strategies for weight loss.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone derived from the liver and adipose tissue that plays a
beneficial role in energy homeostasis when given pharmacologically, but is paradoxically activated by both
fasting and feeding signals. Obesity is associated with elevated levels of circulating FGF21 in rodents and
humans, which correlates with adiposity and adipose tissue FGF21 mRNA levels, suggesting that obesity-
associated FGF21 derives from adipose tissue. While the beneficial effects of pharmacological FGF21 and
hepatic FGF21 on energy metabolism are generally accepted, a clearly defined role for adipocyte-derived
FGF21 has not been established, especially in the context of obesity. Preliminary data suggest that adipocyte-
derived FGF21 promotes deleterious effects on body weight and glucose metabolism, which is in stark contrast
with the beneficial effects observed for pharmacological and hepatic-derived FGF21. Mice deficient in
adipocyte-derived FGF21 (FAKO mice) are protected from diet-induced obesity, have less body fat, and exhibit
increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity over wild-type controls. Thus, the hypotheses of
this proposal are that: (1) the development of obesity requires FGF21; and (2) adipocyte-derived FGF21 is
functionally distinct from hepatic-derived FGF21, and could therefore be targeted pharmacologically. Aim 1 will
determine whether adipocyte-derived FGF21 is sufficient or required for obesity-associated adipose tissue
expansion and associated comorbidities. We will use several loss- and gain-of-function models of genetically-
perturbed mice as well as fat transplantation techniques to ascertain whether adipocyte-derived FGF21 is
important for the development and/or maintenance of obesity. In Aim 2, potential mechanisms by which
adipose FGF21 modulates local and systemic metabolism will be examined. This will include an assessment of
a role for adipocyte-derived FGF21 in thermoregulation, in autocrine signaling in adipose tissue, in systemic
signaling in traditional FGF21 target tissues, and the potential for adipocyte-derived and hepatic-derived
FGF21 to be differentially processed posttranslationally, which could impact their ability to target local or distal
tissues. Reconciling the differences between the beneficial effects of hepatic FGF21 on energy metabolism
and the detrimental effects of adipocyte FGF21 in obesity could increase our understanding of adipocyte
metabolism in obesity. Such knowledge could lead to novel therapeutic strategies to combat obesity, such as
targeting adipocyte-derived FGF21."
10800695,"Both experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that chronic myocardial infarction is associated with
adverse remodeling of the left atrium, which in turn has an adverse impact on left atrial function. Left atrial
dilatation is a powerful and independent predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction, but the mechanisms
underlying the remodeling process are only poorly understood. Surprisingly, we have observed very high rates
of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in the left atrium of infarcted mice. However, the role that cardiomyocyte cell
cycle activity plays in mitigating or exacerbating structural and/or functional remodeling following myocardial
infarction is not known. To directly address this question, we have generated a transgenic mouse model wherein
infarct-induced left atrial cell cycle activity is silenced secondary to p16-Ink4a (p16) expression (p16 is a potent
inhibitor of the proliferative kinase Cdk4 and transgenic expression in adult animals has previously been shown
to be a potent cell cycle inhibitor). Here we propose to compare wild-type and p16 transgenic mice to determine
the impact of atrial cardiomyocyte cell cycle activation on left atrial structural and functional remodeling following
infarction. The experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine the degree to which cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity
impacts structural atrial remodeling following myocardial infarction. Left atrial structural analyses will be
performed (a) at the tissue level to quantitate myocardial mass, cardiomyocyte number, fibrosis, immune cell
infiltration, autonomic innervation and capillary density, (b) at the cardiomyocyte level to quantitate the extent of
cell cycle progression and cellular hypertrophy as well as frequency of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and (c) at the
molecular level to quantitate transcriptome changes. The experiments proposed in Aim 2 will determine the
degree to which cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity impacts atrial function following myocardial infarction. Atrial
functional analyses will be performed (a) at whole organism level to quantitate echocardiographic and
hemodynamic parameters, (b) at the intact heart level to quantitate calcium and voltage transient parameters in
the left atrium (via optical mapping) and of cell clusters within the intact heart (via two-photon laser scanning
microscopy), and (c) at the isolated cell level to quantitate fractional shortening and calcium handling kinetics.
Importantly, cross-referencing the cell and molecular data from Aim 1 with the imaging and functional data from
Aim 2 should enable us to better determine which cell cycle-mediated changes have a relevant impact on cardiac
function. Such information may suggest interventions aimed at reversing compromised left atrial function in
infarcted hearts."

One of the key drivers of the unmet need is health workforce shortage, which has been exacerbated during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This exacerbation has occurred against the backdrop of rising mental disorders among
children, leading to the national emergency in child mental health declared by multiple specialty organizations.
 At the same time, the pandemic has also stimulated innovations, including the widespread adoption of
telehealth, which has been promoted by recent government policies. Although telehealth has long been
advocated for improving health care access for vulnerable populations, such as children living in mental health
professional shortage areas (MHPSAs), no study to date has examined how the recent dramatic growth of
telehealth affects mental health care availability and utilization for children in MHPSAs. Furthermore, amid the
rapid transition to telehealth during the pandemic, some experts have been concerned with disparities in
telehealth access and utilization and called for further research on the equitable development of telehealth.
 In response to that call, this proposed project aims to draw lessons about telehealth adoption during the
pandemic to inform future telehealth policies. As a comprehensive evaluation of state telehealth policies on
licensure, insurance coverage, and reimbursement, the proposed project has three aims: (1) mental health
treatment facility (MHTF) level analyses to assess how changes in state telehealth policies affect disparities in
mental health service availability for children from before to during the pandemic, (2) child level analyses to
evaluate how changes in state telehealth policies affect disparities in mental care access, utilization, and
spending among children from before to during the pandemic, and (3) qualitative interviews with medical
directors at MHTFs to understand their experiences using telehealth to serve children as well as facilitators and
barriers that they have identified for expanding telehealth in MHPSAs.
 For each aim, we will analyze two types of disparities—by area of residence (e.g., MHPSAs vs. non-
shortage areas), and by child socio-demographic characteristic (e.g., race/ethnicity). Examining these
disparities is crucial given the concern about digital health equity during the pandemic.
 To examine the aims, we will analyze quantitative data from both primary and secondary sources,
including our unique longitudinal survey of nearly all MHTFs in the US. We will also collect complementary
qualitative data through interviews with medical directors at MHTFs.
 The proposed study is both timely and important, as state policymakers are considering actions to
revise their telehealth policies. The study findings will help them identify policies that have (or haven’t) been
successful in expanding telehealth services for children with mental disorders—especially those who live in
MHPSAs—to inform subsequent policy decisions."
10801835,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Loss of estrogens at menopause is a major cause of osteoporosis due to an increase in number and activity of
the cells that resorb bone called osteoclasts. Estrogens inhibit bone resorption in part via direct effects on
osteoclasts. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the direct effects of estrogens on
osteoclasts remain unclear. The work proposed in this application seeks to identify the molecular mechanisms
by which estrogens directly control osteoclast number, function, or both. We found that estrogens prevent an
early stimulatory effect of RANKL – the indispensable cytokine for osteoclast differentiation – on mitochondria
respiration and ATP production in osteoclast progenitors. Evolutionarily Conserved Signaling Intermediate in
Toll Pathway (ECSIT) is a mitochondria complex I-associated protein that regulates immune responses in
macrophages in response to inflammatory signals. We found that ECSIT is essential for RANKL-induced
stimulation of mitochondria activity and ATP production and a target for the anti-osteoclastogenic effects of
estrogens. Estrogens also decrease NAD+ levels and NAD+/NADH ratio and promote the mitochondria
pathway of apoptosis. The above observations form the foundation of the hypothesis that estrogens reduce
osteoclast number and bone resorption by inhibiting RANKL stimulation of mitochondria, decreasing NAD+,
and promoting mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The work proposed will elucidate the independent
contribution of ECSIT, NAD, and apoptosis to osteoclastogenesis and the effects of estrogens. We will also
identify possible interactions among these pathways. To test the hypothesis, we will determine whether ECSIT
stimulation of mitochondria activity is required for the bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. This will be
accomplished using mice lacking ECSIT in osteoclast lineage cells. In addition, we will examine the
contribution of NAD to the estrogen deficiency-dependent increase in bone resorption using mice with loss-of-
function of Nampt – an essential enzyme of the NAD salvage pathway – in osteoclast lineage cells. We will
also overexpress mitochondria-targeted water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbNOX) in
osteoclast cultures to examine the contribution of altered NAD+/NADH redox ratio to the effects of estrogen.
Finally, we will investigate whether estrogens decrease osteoclast number by promoting mitochondria-
mediated cell death using mice with simultaneous deletion of Bak and Bax – proteins required for mitochondria
mediated apoptosis – in osteoclast lineage cells. To distinguish effects of estrogen in progenitors versus
mature osteoclasts, we will examine changes in number and gene expression profiles of osteoclast lineage
cells in vivo and in vitro using single cell RNA sequencing. Successful completion of this work should establish
novel mechanisms that contribute to osteoclast development and its regulation by estrogens."

Hsp70 is vital molecular chaperone that folds a large proportion of the proteome. Research has primarily focused
on how Hsp70 function specificity arises through regulation of a) expression of Hsp70, b) isoform differences in
the Hsp70 protein family and c) the variety of co-chaperone proteins that bind to the Hsp70 molecule. Despite
the identification of several phosphorylation sites on both yeast and mammalian Hsp70 through global proteomic
screens, the biological function of most of these sites remains unknown.
 All organisms must respond to fluctuations in external temperature to maintain viability. Cells cope with heat
shock by inducing both the cell integrity and heat shock response pathways. Our preliminary studies have
determined that the cell integrity and heat shock response pathways are more intertwined than previously
thought. Upon heat shock, yeast Hsp70 is rapidly phosphorylated at a single site and correspondingly mediates
the response of yeast to heat stress.
 In this proposal, we will investigate the impact of this site on chaperone function in yeast. Particularly we will
study the role of Hsp70 phosphorylation on aspects of the heat shock response including the formation of both
reversible aggregates and stress granules. In addition, we will investigate the hypothesis that phosphorylation of
Ssa1 feedbacks into cell integrity signaling by supporting the activity of cell integrity kinases.
 Understanding the regulation and interplay of Hsp70 phosphorylation in yeast will provide us with a
completely novel way to target chaperone activity. It may be possible to target specific oncoproteins through
alteration of Hsp70 phosphorylation status and specific Hsp70 phospho-species may have a higher susceptibility
to inhibitors. The scope of this work has broad implications for a variety of diseases associated with MAP kinase
signaling and molecular chaperone function, including many types of cancer and neurodegenerative illnesses."
10801761,"Project Summary Abstract
 Suicide is a leading cause of death in youth across the United States. Approximately 80% of youth who
die by suicide interface with the medical system in the year preceding their death. Primary care practices
(PCPs) serving youth are well positioned to detect patients at risk for suicide and intervene, and widely
accessible toolkits are available for practices to use. However, effective ways to impact providers’ skills in
actually implementing a clinical pathway to manage at-risk patients remain underexplored. Indeed, training
without applied practice and support is likely insufficient to significantly impact these skills in the long term and
less likely to improve patient outcomes. Practice facilitation is a powerful way to transform clinical practice,
develop provider skills, and improve patient outcomes. Our team trains PCPs in the NIMH youth suicide
prevention care pathway and, in addition, assists them in integrating the pathway into routine care with
longitudinally with feedback, implementation support through practice facilitation and data collection. However,
there is limited evidence for the effects of supplemental supports, such as practice facilitation or coaching, on
primary care providers’ adoption of and competence in suicide risk assessment and management. Thus,
guided by the combined Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM)/Practical
Robust Implementation and Sustainability (PRISM) framework, this cluster-randomized trial will compare the
impact of practice facilitation added to didactic suicide prevention training based on the NIMH youth suicide
prevention care pathway (TO+PF) versus training only (TO). In this pilot type 3 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial, Pediatric and Family Medicine practices in our practice-based research networks will be
randomized to TO+PF or to TO. Providers in clinics randomized to the TO+PF arm will also receive practice
facilitation for 6 months, involving monthly individual check-ins which include: 1) clinic- and provider-level data
review of adoption data for the five components of the NIMH youth suicide prevention care pathway, 2) clinical
coaching around implementing the different components of the pathway, and 3) logistical coaching in
identifying multilevel contextual barriers (organized in PRISM domains) to implementation and strategies to
overcome them. At the clinic/provider level, we will assess feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, adoption,
fidelity and implementation and all contextual barriers that emerge. At the patient level, we will follow youth
assessed at intermediate or high risk and their family for 6 months following screening, collecting data on
attempted suicides and suicide ideation as well as emergency room and behavioral health provider visits. The
outcomes will provide preliminary support for a subsequent fully-powered type 3 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial of the model, assessing its reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance, with the goal of promoting broad implementation in diverse clinic contexts."

 Recent breakthroughs in neuromodulation for diet and weight control have stimulated a growing interest in
the development of new anti-obesity strategies. However, achieving effective, real-time, and maintenance-free
electrical neuromodulation with minimal side effects remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, this
project proposes to develop a battery-free, flexible, and implantable piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) that
produces closed-loop, biofeedback electrostimulation (ES) on the vagus nerves to control food intake
in response to stomach motions. This project builds on the collaborative work by Wang (PI) and Cai (co-I) of
an implantable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device, which achieved effective diet and weight control in rats.
The battery- and electronics-free VNS device is attached to the stomach surface and generates alternative
current (AC) ES signals to the vagus nerves only when the stomach moves upon food intake.
 Our preliminary study demonstrated 38% less weight gain on normal adult rats with the VNS device
implantation as compared to controls over a 100-day testing period. Although this efficacy value surpassed most
peer reports, the ES signal intensity was 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller compared to those typically used. We
hypothesize that tuning the closed-loop ES signal to the typical level of neuromodulation may further increase
weight loss efficacy outperforming the currently-used non-natural continuous ES. To test this hypothesis and
eventually bring this intriguing technology to clinic, we propose to develop a piezoelectric NG that provides
tunable ES pulse signals up to 10 V in response to stomach peristalsis, and remains safe and stable over long-
term implantation. We will also optimize the implantation of the VNS device and validate the closed-loop VNS
efficacy and advantages to using standard obese rat models. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a biomaterial-
based flexible piezoelectric NGs that can produce tunable ES pulses in response to simulated stomach
movements. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the biocompatibility of the NG ex vivo and in vivo on the stomach
of rats, and examine implantation sites and in vivo outputs in correlation to stomach motions. In Specific Aim 3,
we will quantify and compare the diet and weight control performances on two obese rat models among three
different strategies of using on-stomach NGs for VNS: (1) battery-powered open-loop VNS; (2) NG-enabled self-
powered closed-loop VNS; (3) NG-switched battery-powered closed-loop VNS.
 This project will deliver a novel biomaterial-based VNS device that is battery- and electronics-free for weight
control. This project uses rat model to test the new VNS devices, providing rapid feedback for device optimization,
and quantifying the therapeutic efficacy in correlation to ES signals. Implantation-related technical issues will
also be addressed. Together, we will establish an essential biological and engineering foundation that will allow
us to move rapidly to the next step of in vivo studies in large animal models, eventually leading to human trials."
10805397,"A central function of the brain is to create internal representations of stimuli and experiences from the outside
world to guide behavior. Here, we examine the circuit mechanisms underlying the neural representation of
external space, a representation essential to spatial memory and navigation, and impacted by neurodegenerative
and psychiatric diseases. The neural basis for the representation of space depends, in part, on circuits in the
medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which contains neurons that encode the spatial position, orientation and running
speed of an animal. Between distinct environments, the firing fields of position and orientation cells can change
their firing rate and rotate or move to a new spatial location – phenomenon known as ‘remapping’. Together with
other structures in the parahippocampal region, MEC neurons can generate unique neural representations for
distinct environments, potentially contributing to the encoding of different contexts or episodes. While remapping
in MEC has often been studied between environments that differ in sensory features (i.e. visual or odor cues),
we have found in recent and preliminary data that behavioral variables (i.e. running speed, expectation of reward)
can evoke internal transitions between neural population states (i.e. remapping) in MEC. Here, we aim to test
the hypotheses that a change in behavioral variables can drive transitions in MEC neural population states via
key nodes in entorhinal circuitry (Aim 1) and that behaviorally driven MEC spatial maps are optimized to
represent features relevant to the navigational behavior executed in the environment (Aim 3). Moreover, we aim
to establish causality between changes in behavioral variables and transitions in MEC neural population states
(Aim 2). To address these aims, we propose to combine electrophysiology using silicon probes with spatial and
memory tasks in behaving mice. Until now, electrophysiological approaches had to contend with limited recording
channel counts, contributing to a lack of studies that considered MEC neural coding at the population level or as
a function of behavioral variables. However, new versions of silicon probes have allowed us to record hundreds
of MEC neurons simultaneously along nearly the entire length of mouse entorhinal cortex. This, combined with
virtual reality tasks that can provide dense sampling of sensory and behavioral variables, as well as optogenetic
perturbations to establish causality between changes in behavioral variables and transitions in MEC neural
population states, will enable us to achieve significant new insight into the mechanisms underlying transitions in
MEC neural population states and the of such transitions in supporting memory and navigation."

Recent immunological and physiological studies have provided evidence in support of a central nervous
system (CNS) lymphatic drainage system in vertebrate animals, which has more recently been implicated in
brain amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque clearance disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementias
(ADRD). This system is believed to comprise (i) dural and meningeal lymphatic vessels that drain CSF and
interstitial fluid (ISF) toward cervical lymph nodes and which may (ii) communicate with the recently-proposed
glymphatic system, an aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-mediated system that facilitates CSF-ISF efflux from periarterial to
perivenous spaces and ultimately to cervical lymphatic vessels and nodes. While multiple independent studies
have speculated that the CNS lymphatic system may have relevance to clearance conditions of unknown
etiology in humans (including but not limited to sleep disorders, CSF clearance disorders, multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson's disease, and ADRD), limited direct information is available on the relevance of this system to these
disorders in humans. The critical barrier to addressing this problem rests with a general lack of imaging
methods that can be applied to interrogate multiple aspects of the proposed human CNS lymphatic system in
vivo. As such, even basic knowledge about how this system changes with age, sex, and behavioral state
remain debated, and these limitations preclude identification of pathological features in patients. Very recently,
we have translated non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods optimized in prior work for
evaluating peripheral blood and lymphatic circulatory dysfunction to the CNS. We have quantified measures of
intracranial glymphatic function in 61 older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD), with and without associated
cognitive dysfunction, and have provided evidence that PD patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
(aMCI) have significantly reduced markers of intracranial glymphatic function compared to age-matched
patients without aMCI, and also that markers of glymphatic flow velocity inversely correlate with brain
Aβ burden quantified from gold-standard PET imaging. These findings provide a foundation in which novel,
non-invasive markers can be applied to understand lymphatic function in healthy tissue and also in the
presence of increased brain Aβ burden. As such, the goal of this work is to apply novel MRI and established
PET approaches to evaluate (i) how the CNS lymphatic system varies with age and sex for healthy aging, and
subsequently the clinical relevance of CNS lymphatic function on (ii) brain Aβ burden and (ii) behavioral state
in PD patients with cognitive impairment, a recognized ADRD. Study findings will provide fundamental insights
into the behavior of the CNS lymphatic system in humans with and without ADRD. More broadly, the methods
developed and refined will provide a support structure for the growing number of studies seeking to interrogate
CNS lymphatic function, but where current imaging tools lack sufficient sensitivity."

 It is increasingly apparent that both common and rare genetic variation influences the risk and severity of
syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Among patients with highly penetrant ASD associated mutations
there is often substantial heterogeneity in the severity of physical, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. However,
precisely which regions of the human genome affect disease outcomes in the context of any high confidence
ASD mutation are currently unknown. This critical gap in knowledge prevents the rational design of therapies
that target underlying molecular and cellular deficiencies.
 Here, I will leverage genetically diverse iPSC lines to test the hypothesis that common genetic variation
shapes the severity of hyperproliferation phenotypes caused by mutations in PTEN, a highly penetrant ASD
associated gene. I will employ a novel pooled cell culture method, which allows rapid and efficient phenotyping
of dozens of distinct lines in the same culture dish, to quantify the variation in hyperproliferation induced by
PTEN haploinsufficiency. This will allow me to identify regions of the genome which modulate this ASD
relevant phenotype, and test for the presence of sex specific genetic effects. I will then mechanistically validate
associated loci with three distinct approaches. First, we will expand and validate our culture-based findings in
patients with 1) idiopathic autism with brain overgrowth with longitudinal MRI and neurocognitive profiling, from
whom these lines were generated, 2) ~600 deeply phenotyped patients with a variety of PTEN mutations and
clinical presentations. Second, we will correlate our findings with those from other genome wide association
studies to identify causal genes, and loci with shared genetic risk with other diseases. Third, we will validate
associated loci in isogenic PTEN(+/-) lines, and test hypotheses aimed at the mechanisms by which genetic
variants protect/exacerbate the effects of PTEN mutations. In all, the proposed studies will identify common
genetic modifiers of phenotypic severity and patient outcomes in a genetically defined ASD subtype.
 To develop the expertise necessary for this cross-disciplinary project, I will undergo comprehensive training
in bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and molecular neurodevelopment under the guidance of my primary
mentor Jason Stein. I will also undergo supplemental training from my advisors in iPSC differentiation methods
(Beltran), MRI image analysis (Piven/Styner), ASD pathogenesis (Piven/Zylka/Eng), and approaches to
correlate genetic and clinical data (Stein/Piven/Eng). They will train me in the methods and principles required
to successfully complete this project. This training will facilitate a successfully transition into my independent
scientific career, where I will study genetic modifiers of neurodevelopmental disorders."

America) Veterans show a higher incidence rate of colon cancer than the general population. It
is estimated that each year the Veterans affairs manages and treats ~175,000 CRC patients. It is
therefore an urgent necessity to find novel therapeutic strategies to curb CRC-malignancy to
increase the overall survival for the U.S. Veterans diagnosed with CRC as well as improve their
quality of life. Characterization of the key molecules involved in the processes critical for CRC
progression to develop novel and promising therapeutic approaches not only holds the promise
of decreasing the patient mortality amongst VA-CRC patients but also reduce the associated
financial burden for the Veterans Administration. The applicant’s lab program is focused on
understanding the molecular mechanism/s involving dysregulation of specific tight junction and
cell cycle proteins in Colon cancer progression and metastasis and developing targeted
therapeutics. Her laboratory is internationally known for its contributions in this area, especially in
understanding the role of Claudins in regulating CRC progression to metastasis and resistance
to conventional therapy. In this regard, extensive preclinical and clinical studies from her
laboratory, have validated a casual role for upregulated claudin-1 expression in promoting CRC
metastasis. Her laboratory is also the 1st lab which has developed a novel inhibitor for inhibiting
claudin-1 for inhibiting CRC. Her laboratory further demonstrated that claudin-7, yet another
claudin family protein, is a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. Her laboratory is also developing
patient-derived organoids, tumor xenografts from known disease stages and variable therapeutic
response, or have access to such reagents through her collaborations. The applicant has a broad
background in cancer biology, with published expertise in the regulation of colon carcinogenesis
and metastasis using in vivo and in vitro mouse, organoid and cell culture models. As a Research
Career Scientist, she will oversee this research program by coordinating the work done; designing
the experiments, delegating the work and monitoring the work to ensure that it progresses in a
timely fashion. She will also be involved in preparing manuscripts of the work performed and
presenting the results at conferences in this area of cancer biology, therapeutics in CRC patients.
Applicant’s research program has been continuously funded by VA Merit Award and multiple NIH-
grant awards for ~17 years. She has extensively published her laboratory work in over 75 original
peer reviewed research articles in prestigious journals in the field including Gastroenterology
(impact factor 33), GUT (Impact Factor 31) and J Clin Invest (19.4). In addition, one of the key
hallmarks of her program has been a multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of the research
enterprise with a deep focus on mentoring new generation of VA and affiliated university
investigators to enable them to establish their own independent research programs. She has been
successful at both the fronts: making new discoveries in the field and mentoring new generation
of young scientists and establishing a solid research environment at our local VA as well as at
affiliated university. This current application is intended to highlight the success of our program
and requesting RCS program to help us progress towards the new heights of success by nurturing

10800883,"The plasma-membrane monoamine transporters (MATs), including the serotonin (SERT), norepinephrine (NET)
and dopamine (DAT) transporters, serve a pivotal role in limiting monoamine-mediated neurotransmission
through the reuptake of their respective neurotransmitters. MATs are targets for the treatment of numerous
neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and they
serve as target proteins for major drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine. The continuing need for
therapeutic drugs to treat brain disorders involving aberrant monoamine signaling provides a compelling reason
to further our understanding of transporter function and to identify novel ways of targeting them.
This project builds on our recent discovery of an allosteric site (A2) within the MATs that can serve as a target
site for modulating their activity. Previous experiments in our group targeted the allosteric A2 site in SERT and
identified molecules that interact with this site and display remarkable transporter-modulating activities. These
compounds have revealed that engaging this site modulate MAT activity in entirely novel ways, including
affecting the interaction with transporter ligands such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
psychostimulants. In corresponding experiments on DAT, we have identified compounds, KM822 and sydnocarb
among others, that similarly modifies DAT function. We find that these compounds interfere with the interaction
of DAT with exogenous ligands and attenuates psychostimulant-elicited behaviors in rodents. Computational
simulations further support the premise that compounds interacting with the allosteric A2 site can allow transport
while interfering with the interaction of the transporter with exogenous ligands like cocaine.
The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the specific engagement of the allosteric site in DAT will provide
valuable information regarding mechanisms of the dopamine transport process and could provide novel
therapeutic avenues for developing DAT-based medications. We propose to pursue this idea by further
characterizing the compounds to study allosteric modulation of DAT. We will in Aim 1 elucidate mechanisms of
allosteric transporter modulation through computational modelling and molecular simulations coupled with
functional and biochemical studies. In aim 2 we will evaluate the in vivo utility of the compounds by examining
their effects on psychostimulant-elicited behaviors in rodents. Finally, in Aim 3, we will employ structure-based
design to identify A2-specific compounds with improved properties. Consequently, the successful completion of
this project will result in the development of novel ligands of DAT that can be employed as experimental tools to
provide critical mechanistic information regarding allosteric transporter modulation. Furthermore, the design and
development of novel allosteric modulators of DAT will enable a systematic evaluation of the beneficial potential
of these compounds to ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities."
10800886,"Synaptic disruption is a prelude to and often a primary cause of neurological disease, but we have few
strategies to correct dysmorphic synapses, even if they occur early in the degenerative process. Growth
control pathways, i.e. those that promote protein and lipid synthesis while reducing catabolism, regulate
synaptic form that in turn ensures efficient function and plasticity. The 7-pass endosomal membrane protein
TMEM184B regulates synaptic structure and function across species; accordingly, its loss causes exuberant
synaptic sprouting, swollen nerve terminals, and altered excitability. In humans, disruption of conserved amino
acids in TMEM184B is linked to nervous system disruptions including microcephaly, intellectual disability,
corpus callosum hypoplasia, and epilepsy. While TMEM184B genetic disruptions are rare, the disorders
produced by TMEM184B disruption are common, suggesting an intersection with key neurological pathways.
 Our long-term goal is to define the mechanisms underlying TMEM184B variant-associated nervous system
disorders in order to provide mechanistic guidance for their treatment. Our overall objectives in this proposal
are to determine how TMEM184B directs key signaling pathways supporting neuronal structure and function
and to illuminate how patient variants of TMEM184B alter synaptic transmission and resultant behavior.
TMEM184B has sequence similarity to bile acid and sterol transporters, but this proposed molecular function
remains untested. Preliminary data and published studies suggest an intersection between TMEM184B and
mTOR, but how TMEM184B influences mTOR pathway activity is completely unknown.
 We hypothesize that TMEM184B is an endosomal transporter whose function impacts mTORC1 signaling
to promote synaptic structure and function. In Aim1, we will evaluate the specific contributions of TMEM184B
to the mTORC1 pathway using primary cortical neuron cultures from wild type and TMEM184B mutant mice.
We will evaluate the function of upstream activators and downstream effectors of mTORC1 using functional
readouts as well as lipidomic and phospho-proteomic tools. In Aim 2, we will model human disease-linked
TMEM184B variants in Drosophila by introducing patient mutations into conserved amino acids. With these
flies we will evaluate synaptic form, function (electrophysiological recording), and behavior. In Aim 3, we will
establish the molecular function of the TMEM184B protein using a combination of in silico, thermodynamic,
and proteomic assays to reveal candidate transport substrates and other metabolites most affected by
TMEM184B disruption. Overall, our multifaced approach will illuminate the mechanism through which
TMEM184B acts to ensure synaptic morphology and function while enabling a better classification of
TMEM184B-associated disorders with others of similar etiology, facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment."
10801589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide results in 130 preventable American deaths every day, and >700,000 deaths worldwide each year. Non-
fatal suicide attempt (SA) affects an even larger proportion of the population with estimates 10-25 times the
number of individuals who die by suicide (1.4 million in the US, >20 million worldwide). Suicidal ideation (SI), the
contemplation of taking one’s own life, is even more common, with a cross-national lifetime prevalence of 9.2%.
While these suicide outcomes are all significantly heritable, only recently have samples reached sufficient size
to conduct well-powered genetic studies, and thus far, these have largely been limited to SA. Large-scale genetic
studies of the full spectrum of suicide outcomes are necessary to elucidate their genetic and biological etiologies,
potential drug targets, and the similarities and differences between them. Here, we establish the Suicide Working
Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, to interrogate the biological basis of the full spectrum of suicide
outcomes in individuals of diverse ancestries, leveraging clinical, population, and medical examiner resources
worldwide. This project will characterize the genetic etiology of suicide outcomes through genome-wide
association studies of at least 69,800 SA cases, 19,500 suicide death (SD) cases, and 206,900 SI cases. We
will elucidate the shared and distinct genetic etiology between suicide outcomes and psychiatric disorders, and
between SA, SD and SI, illuminating the similarities and differences between them. These results will be used
to identify biologically relevant tissues, cell-types, pathways, and drug targets, and to prioritize causal genes and
SNPs underlying genome-wide significant loci. Overall, this proposal dramatically expands and diversifies efforts
to understand the etiology of suicide outcomes, combining prior efforts and expertise from the PI and Co-Is in
genomic studies of SA, SD and SI. The study will provide novel biological insights into genetic risk of suicide
outcomes that will enable potential avenues of therapeutic understanding and risk stratification. Finally, it will
facilitate the worldwide collaborative growth of a highly-powered cohort of diverse ancestries, environmental
exposures, and phenotypes, in which to address many future questions related to suicide outcomes."
10801685,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Granule cells (GCs) constitute over 95% of the cerebellar volume. They receive and integrate sensory,
motor, and non-sensorimotor signals to fine-tune motor behaviors and cognitive tasks. GCs are generated from
transiently proliferating granule cell precursors (GCPs) over a long time extending from early embryonic period
until first postnatal year in human. Accordingly, cerebellar hypoplasia is one of the most common brain
complications in premature infants with poor developmental outcomes. We have very limited basic knowledge
of how GC lineage is established. Our long term goals are to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of GC lineage
development, and to understand how different risk factors cause cerebellar hypoplasia. A master regulator of
GCP development is the bHLH transcription factor Atoh1 that maintains the GCP fate through activation of its
own expression. This autoregulatory feedback loop is further supported by a cell cycle regulator Ccnd1 that
stabilizes Atoh1 protein from degradation. However, it remains unclear as to how Atoh1 and Ccnd1 expressions
are terminated to enable timely progression from GCPs to GCs. Our preliminary data suggest that Sin3A, a
component of histone deacetylase (Hdac)–containing transcriptional corepressor complex, is essential for GCP
differentiation by epigenetically silencing Atoh1 expression. We have also identified Insm1, a zinc-finger
transcription factor, as a potential partner of the Sin3A-Hdac complex that inhibits Atoh1 and Ccnd1 expression.
Based on these and other preliminary observations, we propose the novel hypothesis that the Sin3a/Hdac/Insm1
complex epigenetically represses Atoh1 and Ccnd1 expression, thereby integrating transcriptional and
posttranslational signals to regulate GCP fate and cell cycle progression. This hypothesis will be tested by
establishing (1) Sin3A function during GC lineage development, and (2) the role of Insm1 in GCP differentiation."
10801921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, the Zika virus (ZIKV) has the unique ability among flaviviruses to
be transmitted horizontally through sexual contact, or vertically from mother to fetus. The vertical mode of
transmission has led to devastating pregnancy and fetal development outcomes that came to light in 2015-16,
as a ZIKV epidemic emerged in the Western hemisphere and a public health emergency of international concern
was declared. The threat of future ZIKV epidemics persists and many nations where it has become endemic
continue to struggle with the adverse effects of infection. Meanwhile, scientists have struggled to understand the
mechanisms that underlie maternal-fetal transmission of ZIKV on a cellular and molecular level. This proposal
presents preliminary data for the first time that supports a novel hypothesis that transmission of ZIKV at the
maternal-fetal interface is facilitated by the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which are actin-based
intercellular transport conduits that have been shown to play a role in the spread of other viruses. Among other
things, the preliminary data indicates that, 1) ZIKV infection induces the formation of TNTs in various cell types,
including human placental trophoblast cells, 2) the ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is alone sufficient to
induce TNT formation, whereas NS1 proteins of several other flaviviruses tested do not appear to have this
ability, with the exception of WNV to a small degree, and 3) ZIKV-induced TNTs transport mitochondria in
trophoblast cells in a manner that may be exploited for the benefit of virus propagation and transmission. Building
on these observations, and using the tools the PIs have so far developed, they propose a formal collaboration
and rigorous set of experiments designed to test this hypothesis. First, using a library of labeled ZIKV constructs,
confocal imaging, and an advanced affinity purification-mass spectrometry approach, the role of NS1 in inducing
TNT formation without affecting virus replication and assembly will be established in human trophoblast cells;
then specific regions of this protein will be identified that may participate in signaling or interaction with host
proteins; and the question of whether TNTs transport ZIKV RNA and/or whole virions will be evaluated. Second,
mouse models of ZIKV infection during pregnancy that the PIs have developed in prior work will be used to
investigate the role of TNT formation in ZIKV pathogenesis and vertical transmission; the impact of TNT formation
on ZIKV infection pathogenesis in the placenta will be evaluated; and spatial transcriptomics paired with tissue
profiling will be used to identify genomic pathways in the placenta that are key for TNT formation. And thirdly,
the nature of mitochondria transport via TNTs will be investigated to determine the role of any interactions with
ZIKV virions or NS1, and the effects this has on cell metabolism and viral transmission. If successful, the resulting
findings will establish an important and undescribed cellular pathway for transmission of the ZIKV that will serve
as a likely target for future therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing microcephaly and other effects of ZIKV
infection during pregnancy."
10805443,"Development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is multifactorial, and some causal factors can be influenced or modified. Recently, the Lancet Commission included traumatic brain injury (TBI) in its list of 12 key potentially modifiable ADRD risk factors. TBI is a very common injury among older adults, resulting in over 123,000 hospitalizations and 485,000 emergency department visits annually. Importantly, rates of TBI are rapidly increasing in this population. TBI results in cognitive impairment and increases risk for both Alzheimer's disease and fronto-temporal dementia. Furthermore, TBI can result in worsened health outcomes (e.g., poor physical functioning, psychological distress, worsened sleep quality), which in turn increase risk for ADRD. Yet, despite the large public health impact of TBI among older adults, little is known about changes in cognition and related domains following discharge from acute care in this population. Although such information is urgently needed to guide rehabilitation, care planning, and promotion of optimal long-term recovery in this vulnerable population, these data are severely lacking in the literature. One major reason for this lack of knowledge is that most prior research on TBI has focused on younger adults. Unfortunately, many findings from younger adults do not generalize to older adults due to their higher comorbidity burden and poorer cognitive and physical functioning at discharge from acute care. The objective of the proposed research is to gain an in-depth understanding of recovery of cognition, psychological and physical functioning, and sleep quality following TBI among older adults. To achieve this objective, we propose to conduct a prospective cohort study of 250 patients aged 65 years and older treated for mild TBI at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center with follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months to complete three Specific Aims: 1) Assess recovery of cognitive functioning and identify predictors of poor recovery; 2) Assess recovery of physical and psychological functioning and sleep quality and identify predictors of poor recovery; 3) Identify interactions between recovery trajectories. The significance of this research is that it will identify unique recovery patterns across important domains of functioning (including cognitive function) and factors that impact the course of recovery following mild TBI among older adults. Identification of individuals at risk for poor cognitive recovery following TBI will highlight a population at high risk of ADRD and would permit targeting those individuals with cognitive rehabilitation interventions, potentially reducing ADRD risk. The rationale for the proposed study is that early identification of patients with poorer recovery trajectories will permit development and targeting of appropriately timed interventions to mitigate ADRD risk and other adverse outcomes. The potential impact of this work is that it will generate new knowledge that will guide targeted treatment efforts and inform development of a geriatric-TBI focused rehabilitation intervention that will be the focus of a future R01 application."
10793083,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cellular plasticity of the human pancreas is implied from multiple scRNAseq studies.
However, these have been invariably based on static datasets from which fate trajectories can
only be inferred using pseudotemporal estimations. Furthermore, the reliance on isolated islet
preparations for the conduct of these analyses has resulted in a drastic underrepresentation of
other non-endocrine cell types, hindering our ability to accurately interrogate exocrine-endocrine
interactions. The long-term culture of human pancreatic slices (HPSs) has presented the field with
an opportunity to sidestep these limitations by longitudinally tracking tissue plasticity at the single-
cell level. Combining single-cell transcriptomic datasets from same-donor HPSs at different time
points, with or without a known regenerative stimulus (BMP signaling), has led to the integration
of dynamic datasets that store true temporal or treatment-dependent information. This novel
approach (Dynamic SliceSeq, or DSSeq for short) has revealed population shifts consistent with
the BMP-mediated progenitor cell activation, the blurring of ductal/acinar boundaries, the
formation of clear ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation axes and, notably, the appearance of
transitional insulin+ cell populations ‘caught in the act’ of adopting endocrine fates.
Our research is the first to unveil human pancreatic plasticity at the single cell level as a function
of treatment and time. In vitro lineage tracing indicates that BMP signaling also elicits the
formation of functional glucose-responsive insulin+ cells within the exocrine compartment of slices
from type 1 diabetic (t1D) donors. Our first hypothesis is that the path through which these cells
arise in samples from non-diabetic donors will be largely preserved in those with autoimmune
diabetes, and potentially even reinforced as a result of compensatory responses. We further
hypothesize that the ductoacinar-endocrine differentiation axis identified by DSSeq (where
progenitor populations of BMP-stimulated ductal cells differentiate into endocrine cells through an
intermediate acinar-like stage) may mirror the process of embryonic ductal delamination. In
particular, we expect BMP signaling to induce such progenitors to migrate into the acinar
parenchyma prior to their coalescence into islets. To test these hypotheses, we will pursue the
following specific aims: (1) DSSeq analysis of BMP-induced endocrine regeneration in HPSs from
t1D donors; (2) Longitudinal resolution of ductal tissue remodeling and neogenesis of insulin+ cells
within their native histological microenvironment; and (3) Spatial transcriptomics analysis of islet-
duct interfaces in histological samples from nPOD’s t1D collection.
The development of long-term HPS culture techniques, and especially DSSeq, has enabled the
dissection of regenerative responses directly in live tissue from t1D donors with an unprecedented
degree of resolution. The completion of our research objectives is expected to correlate the
dynamic compartmental plasticity revealed by DSSeq with real-time histological changes induced
by BMP signaling in HPSs from diabetic donors. Beyond the significance of these findings from a
basic science perspective, our research will have a direct impact on the design of therapeutic
approaches to regenerate β-cells in diabetic patients."

Project Summary. This research program aims to test the hypothesis that inhibition of interferon regulatory
factor-4 (IRF4) will disrupt stem cell pathway activation in multiple myeloma and synergize with standard-of-
care drugs to reduce overall disease burden and prevent malignant stem cell generation in multiple myeloma.
Multiple myeloma is a fatal plasma cell neoplasm that is characterized by the malignant expansion of abnormal
antibody-producing cells. Despite recent therapeutic advances, most patients eventually relapse. These poor
clinical outcomes occur as a result of uncontrolled regeneration of malignant stem-like cells in protective,
inflammatory microenvironments. However, the precise transcriptional determinants of myeloma stemness in
the bone marrow niche remain poorly understood. One intriguing candidate is IRF4, a key B-cell transcription
factor and myeloma cell survival factor. IRF4 also governs normal plasma cell development and immune
responses to inflammation, however the extent to which IRF4 promotes malignant progenitor generation in
lymphoid or plasma cell neoplasms is unknown. A 50% reduction in IRF4 expression can disrupt myeloma cell
survival, but IRF4 remains undeveloped as a therapeutic target because transcription factors are difficult to
inhibit using traditional small molecule strategies. To overcome this challenge, proof-of-concept studies were
performed to evaluate novel RNA-targeted therapeutic agents that directly inhibit human IRF4 RNA expression
and protein translation. This administrative supplement is requested to provide additional salary support for
laboratory personnel, equipment, and publication funding intended to offset additional costs incurred as a result
of a critical life event for the PI, thus ensuring the continued success of the parent award project in completing
the three ongoing research Aims. Aim 1: Interrogating the role of IRF4 in functional myeloma stem cell
generation. This aim will determine the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that link IRF4 to myeloma regeneration. Aim
2: IRF4 inhibitor monotherapy and combination drug treatment in pre-clinical models of multiple myeloma. This
aim will develop combination drug treatment and biomarker detection strategies that leverage selective IRF4
inhibition. Aim 3: Elucidating the bone marrow microenvironment-derived signals that promote IRF4 pathway
activation in myeloma regeneration. This aim will elucidate the paracrine mechanisms underlying myeloma
regeneration and the activity of a novel cancer therapeutic. Supplemental funding will accelerate the PI’s
productivity through the supplement period and enable parent award funds to be redirected towards key
supplies and reagents as originally budgeted. Together, the proposed research will set the stage for rapid
clinical translation of more selective combination therapies for myeloma."
11003877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human gut microbiome is intimately connected with health, with disruptions of its ecological composition
associated with numerous diseases. Manipulations of the microbiome via fecal microbiome transplants (FMTs),
in which microbial strains derived from healthy donor stool are introduced to a patient’s gut community, have
been found to be effective treatments for certain diseases, but less effective for others. In several cases in
which FMTs fail to resolve a disease, invading strains fail to colonize, but it is unknown why, and even when
strains do colonize, a healthy clinical outcome still is not guaranteed. Experimental evolution studies in mouse
and bee microbiomes have shown that strains invading a host rapidly adapt, enabling colonization via physical
adherence to host cells, competition with resident strains, and evasion of the host immune system. Despite this
strong experimental support for the importance of adaptation during colonization, its role in the human gut
microbiome has received little attention. Recently, we and others found that microbiome can evolve rapidly on
months and even days, but the impacts of this rapid pace of evolution on the colonization process remains
unknown. The main roadblock to linking adaptation and colonization lies in the statistical challenges of
quantifying the full landscape of adaptations from noisy metagenomic data. Here I propose to develop new
statistical methods that elucidate the evolutionary processes relevant for colonization in the
microbiome and apply them to one of the largest datasets of FMT recipients.
My lab’s main goal is to understand how microbiomes evolve in a range of contexts and timescales. To this
end, the overarching objective of my proposed MIRA research program is to elucidate the evolutionary
processes that permit colonization of a strain. To fully quantify the mode, tempo, and targets of evolution in the
gut microbiome and their relevance to colonization, we will develop novel methodology capable of detecting
evolutionary events that are undetectable presently, including evolutionary changes (1) arising within hosts on
short timescales and (2) across hosts on longer time scales. To illustrate the potential of our statistical
innovations, we will study FMT recipients given that the identities of invading versus resident strains can be
easily distinguished. However, FMTs represent an example of a more general phenomenon of colonization
relevant to a range of cohorts and questions that my lab is studying, including the role of evolution in infants
experiencing an influx of microbes at birth, strain turnover during consumption of antibiotics and probiotics, and
spatial segregation of evolutionary adaptations needed for colonization along the gut. In sum, successful
completion of this work will not only generate statistical innovations needed to quantify evolution in the
microbiome, but also elucidate the importance of evolution in colonization, knowledge that promises to yield
more efficacious microbiome therapies."
10928179,"Development and validation of a workflow to conduct virtual bioequivalence studies using PBBM-
PBPK models. – Project Summary
 This project aims to define and validate a workflow to demonstrate bioequivalence using in silico
mechanistic models. The offerors decided to focus on PBBM-PBPK models and will use two separate
software to perform the analysis: GastroPlus© and PK-SIM©. By doing so, advantages, limitations, and gaps
will be identified across leading platforms used to describe the ADME of APIs.
 This goal will be achieved through three elements: (1) identification of case studies in the University of
Maryland and other partners’ databases; (2) validation of the ability of GastroPlus and PK-SIM to predict the
inter- and intrasubject variability; (3) simulation of informative scenario to support the establishment of the
virtual bioequivalence workflow in collaboration with FDA scientist.
 Case studies’ datasets will support the development and validation of PBBM-PBPK models for multiple
APIs on both platforms. Then, virtual populations simulation will be compared with observed individual PK
concentration time courses to assess the ability of both platforms to describe the clinically observed
intersubject variability. Based on the results, quantifiable validation criteria will be developed. Those will serve
as a checkpoint in the workflow before conducting any virtual bioequivalence study. The PBBM-PBPK models
will then be used to perform multiple virtual bioequivalence studies, and the results will be compared with
either positive or negative case studies from collaborators’ datasets. Informative scenarios will be simulated
to support the development of the workflow based on drug product characteristics (e.g., high variability, narrow
therapeutic index). Furthermore, the integration of intrasubject variability in the workflow will be tested.
 The findings from this project will support the regulatory assessment of generic drug products. The
developed and validated workflow will help to establish scientific and regulatory standards for supporting
innovative development and performing virtual bioequivalence evaluation of these generic drug products."
10789371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical decision support (CDS) systems were developed to improve the quality and safety of medical practice.
At present, however, these systems are generally not tied to clinical outcomes, decreasing their effectiveness.
Additionally, CDS is often built one institution at a time, so effective CDS does not scale and achieve its
potential. Our proposed study aims to expand existing CDS metrics and data sharing infrastructure across six
CTSA hubs. In doing so, this study seeks to fully realize the effectiveness of CDS systems through the
leveraging of electronic health record (EHR) data and ultimately reducing the barriers to highly efficient data
interoperability. Our hypothesis is that the development of translational metrics and data sharing infrastructure
across multiple institutions will address both translational science and research barriers, increasing the
efficiency and effectiveness of CDS, and improving clinical outcomes. Through this study, we will create a
centralized and highly efficient data-sharing infrastructure to support translational clinical decision support
analysis and benchmarking of performance across sites. We will ground our work in the EPIS Framework,
which consists of Exploratory, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment phases. The EPIS conceptual
framework is well-known, reliable, efficient, and scientifically valid for our approach. We will ground the work
from all five aims (across both the UG3 and UH3 phases) in this framework, testing our approach for gains in
efficiency, collaborative performance, and translational outcomes. In the UG3 Phase (Aims 1-3) we will create
the processes and governance for the Translational CDS Collaborative, build the analytical infrastructure and
test its performance, and establish feasibility of the collaborative beyond the initial study sites. After reaching
our milestone goals, we will progress into the UH3 Phase (Aims 4-5), which will evaluate the impact of the
collaborative on clinical outcomes and expand the capabilities and impact of the infrastructure.
The proposed work will set the foundation for efficiently and effectively creating, disseminating, implementing,
and evaluating electronic CDS. We will create a centralized collaborative learning platform and shareable
resources for CTSI sites, acting as an innovation nidus for the entire informatics and clinical research
community, enabling data-driven CDS design recommendations and frameworks. This CTSA-sponsored
project will aggregate the expertise, talent, and resources we have at our individual sites into a collective
program that is designed to reframe CDS as a translational catalyst and enabler. The multi-site foundation we
propose will serve as the starting point for the development of next-generation analysis of CDS data, the
effective design of impactful CDS-based interventions, and innovative approaches to solving some of the
largest challenges in modern informatics and clinical practice."
10788635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, causing 50–75% of all dementia cases, and
currently affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide. A major problem in AD research is that we still
do not have accepted measures of biomarkers that are useful in clinical trials for AD, which makes it difficult to
enroll the most relevant cohorts and test the mechanism of action of drug candidates. This is compounded by
the fact that current biomarker testing is dominated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission
tomography (PET) scans. CSF testing is invasive, while PET scans are expensive and not easily accessible.
Research on alternative drug targets for AD has recently started to grow, and as a result, there is a strong
need for new biomarker targets and new modalities to measure these biomarkers. These modalities would be
ideally low-cost, non-invasive, and easily scalable. Raman spectroscopy has shown good promise in
distinguishing early-stage AD from cognitively healthy controls, while mass spectrometry has shown good
potential in distinguishing certain neurological disorders from cognitively healthy controls using the novel
concept of conformational biomarkers. Different from classical concentration-based disease biomarkers,
conformational biomarkers reflect the changes in structure. However, conventional Raman spectroscopy
systems are not scalable, and mass spectrometry is both expensive and time consuming. An emerging
concept is waveguide enhanced Raman spectroscopy (WERS). Along with providing increased light
efficiencies, it can also make use of current CMOS fabrication techniques, allowing nanophotonic chips to be
mass produced. In terms of conformational sensing, light scattering spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a
reliable technique for sensing nanoscale changes in conformational properties.
Given these findings, we hypothesize that a scalable photonics-based lab-on-a-chip device can be used for the
simultaneous investigation of multiple novel biochemical and biophysical AD biomarkers. These hypotheses
will be addressed in the experiments of the following Specific Aims: (1) Develop a low-cost, scalable, and label-
free testing platform based on waveguide enhanced Raman spectroscopy to detect existing and novel
biomarkers in blood plasma; and (2) Develop a prototype label-free testing platform based on light scattering
spectroscopy for characterizing misfolded proteins in CSF samples. Should these aims be successful, it opens
the possibility of developing a scalable lab-on-a-chip device for straightforward screening of AD patients and
monitoring of disease progression, both of which are critical requirements for future AD therapeutic
development. The results would also have broad implications for other neurological disorders."
10789030,"SUMMARY
Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent diseases and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Given
its high inter-patient variability to response to treatment, ineffectiveness of available pain medication to
completely relieve chronic pain, and unequal availability of pain treatments for underrepresented
populations, it remains a burdensome, difficult to treat condition. In this context, neuroplasticity-targeted
interventions (NTIs) are being investigated as a potential solution for the current issues with chronic
pain. They are a group of diversified therapies that modulate neuroplasticity of pain-related pathways
through bottom-up or top-down approaches. Although significant effects of electricity-based techniques
such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been evidenced for pain reduction in
different chronic pain conditions, there is high inter-trial variability regarding these results with different
combined NTIs. Therefore, given the hard-to-treat nature of chronic pain and the unknown optimal
combination of NTIs, this proposed project suggests a multiphase optimization strategy to assess the
direct and indirect comparative effects of NTIs (and their components) in chronic pain, and to develop
a treatment hierarchy using living Bayesian network meta-analyses (Aim 1). These meta-analyses will
provide the framework for the development of supervised machine learning models to predict analgesic
response to NTIs in chronic pain (Aim 2). Aim 2 will be carried out with the use of secondary, clinical,
and neurophysiological data from 14 clinical trials with 669 patients to implement multilevel modeling
considering different chronic pain predictors shared among different chronic pain conditions and types
of interventions. Both evidence bodies (network meta-analyses and predictive models) will be deployed
in an open access web-based platform, which will facilitate the constant update (monthly) and data
sharing to a broad user population. My expertise and background in meta-research, data science,
neuromodulation, and chronic pain research will allow me to fulfill this project’s aims with no foreseeable
obstacles. Moreover, I will be working with collaborators from Spaulding Neuromodulation Center and
University of Sao Paulo that have been significantly involved in studies conveying the promising effects
of NTIs for the reduction of chronic pain. Therefore, the R03 award will provide preliminary data for
further funding application and promote the precision pain management approach via data sharing and
fusion approaches."
10789223,"Project Summary / Abstract
Spatial memory is a core competency necessary for healthy independent living and for animal survival. While
the hippocampus is well-established to be necessary for spatial memory, it remains poorly understood when
and what the hippocampus does to support spatial memory. Studies of hippocampal function in rodents have
focused predominantly on epochs of locomotion and quiet rest. Minimal attention has been given to the
ubiquitously observed non-locomotor exploratory behavior of rearing onto the hind legs (rearing for short).
Rearing occurs most frequently in novel environments, correlates with environmental learning, and engages
rhythmic processing in the hippocampus. Yet, it remains untested whether epochs of rearing are necessary for
spatial memory performance and what updates to the neuronal population code result from rearing. This
project will address these gaps with new empirical experiments. Our focus on rearing is motivated by our new
preliminary data showing that inhibiting the dorsal hippocampus selectively during rearing impairs spatial
memory. Aim 1 will establish the importance of rearing as an epoch of hippocampal dependent spatial memory
encoding in relation to other well-studied behavioral epochs. We will accomplish this through closed-loop
optogenetic modulation of hippocampal activity and behavioral analysis in rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis
that rearing supports error correction of spatial coding in the hippocampus. This will be accomplished through
chronically implanted arrays of independently movable tetrodes in freely behaving rats. By the completion of
these aims, this project will advance our mechanistic understanding of spatial memory and for our
understanding of rearing as an epoch of mnemonic encoding. If successful, these results will lay the foundation
for an R01-level program of research investigating the mechanistic basis of the rearing-mediated learning
effect and the relevance of rearing-mediated learning for memory disorders and mental health."
10790197,"Malaria remains a major global infectious disease that infects hundreds of millions of people and is responsible
for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Two major species of parasite, Plasmodium falciparum and P.
vivax are responsible for the majority of clinical cases. During the course of a malaria infection, parasites undergo
repeated cycles of invasion and replication in red blood cells (RBC) which leads to all symptom of the disease.
An essential step in this process is parasite invasion: a mature schizont will burst releasing 16 – 20 merozoites
which will bind to and invade a new host RBC in a process that takes less than a minute. During this time, the
merozoite deploys an array of invasion ligand proteins that facilitate the different steps of the invasion process.
Over 70 candidate P. falciparum invasion ligand proteins have been identified and are thought to bind to cognate
host receptor proteins on the surface of the RBC. However, to date less than a third of the candidate invasion
ligand proteins have been demonstrated to bind to RBCs and even fewer host receptors have been identified.
Comprehensive identification of a global P. falciparum invasion ligand bindome is a major gap in the field and
would greatly facilitate prioritizing targets for a blood stage malaria vaccine. Here we propose a new approach:
biotinylated supernatant erythrocyte binding assay proteomics (BSEP) in order to globally identify the P.
falciparum bindome. In BSEP, purified schizont stage parasites are allowed to egress in protein free media to
generate a supernatant enriched in invasion ligand proteins. These invasion ligand proteins are biotinylated,
incubated with RBCs which are then spun through mineral oil. Bound proteins are eluted via high salt treatment,
purified via streptavidin beads and subjected to quantitative tandem mass-tag based proteomics. In this proposal
we aim to systematically develop the BSEP protocol by testing for the optimal way to generate and biotinylate
parasite supernatants, and to determine binding specificity by using RBC binding saturation and supernatant
depletion assays (with antibodies against known invasion ligands as controls). We will also use BSEP to identify
invasion ligands binding to candidate host receptors by comparing the bindomes between WT and candidate
host receptor knockouts generated in an immortalized erythroid cell line and already available in the lab. We will
validate this approach using the well-known interaction between PfEBA175 invasion ligand and host glycophorin
A (GypA) using a ∆GypA knockout. We will use a similar approach with our candidate host receptor glycophorin
B (GypB). GypB is thought to interact with PfEBL-1 invasion ligand; however, GypB knockdown RBCs show a
strong invasion defect with parasite strains that have either wild type or EBL-1 deletions, thus suggesting the
presence of an alternative invasion. We will validate candidate invasion ligands by recombinant expression
followed by flow cytometry binding assays with WT or ∆GypB cells. Once established, we believe that the BSEP
approach will rapidly enhance our understanding of invasion ligand/host receptor interactions and would be
highly generalizable to other malaria parasite species, including P. vivax, about which even less is known."
10790271,"Project Abstract: Diabetic retinal disease (DRD) is the leading cause of vision loss among working age adults
costing the U.S. an estimated $4.5 billion per year and disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities.2,3
As with any pressing public health concern, tracking the prevalence and incidence of the disease is paramount
to understanding the impact on society and creating successful policies to counteract it. The previously
preferred method of assessing U.S. DRD rates has been regional population-based studies, but even the most
recent of these has not been updated in over 10 years.6–10 The National Eye Institute’s currently published
DRD rates are derived from expert consensus agreed upon in 2001.2,15 The issue of comparisons across time
and regions becomes even more pronounced when discussing U.S. racial and ethnic disparities. While known
disparities exist among minorities in DRD screening rates, severity of DRD and associated vision loss,6–9 the
primary study used to quote rates of DRD in Black/African Americans is the Salisbury Eye Study. This was
undertaken in the 1990’s and focused solely on people living in Maryland.19 Data on US Hispanics comes only
from Los Angles and Arizona and have not been updated in 20 years.20,21 Lastly, relying on regional and
outdated data ignores the last 20 years of national macro-environmental trends that likely have had a direct
impact on DRD rates. How the conflicting trends of improved systemic DM care and increasing DM incidence
have impacted the overall rates of DRD, the time to DRD progression and whether racial and ethnic disparities
have changed has yet to be assessed.22
 We hypothesize that while national DRD prevalence is increasing (due to more people living with
the disease), DRD incidence is decreasing due to better systemic DM care. In addition, similar to the
reduced DRD incidence rates, we hypothesize that due to new tools for systemic monitoring and
treatment, the time to DRD progression is increasing (i.e. improving). We also hypothesize that despite
the improvements in DRD incidence, DRD racial and ethnic disparities are continuing to widen,
exacerbated by increasing disparities in underlying systemic DM incidence rates.
 The goal of this grant will be to create accurate, current national prevalence and incidence measurements
of DRD. Furthermore, understanding the trajectory of the disease, particularly differences between racial and
ethnic minorities will allow for both more effective policy creation tailored to the groups most in need and the
tracking of the effectiveness of these policies by providing a baseline for future assessments."
10793472,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had devastating consequences, with more than 110,000,000 cases and
2,400,000 deaths worldwide. Beyond the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, much of the morbidity and
mortality stems from dysregulated activation of the immune system that culminates in systemic manifestations
ranging from cytokine storm to autoimmunity. Recent work suggests that the basis for observed autoimmune
complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection resides in the high degree of sequence overlap between viral proteins
and native tissue antigens. Given this sequence overlap and the potential for molecular mimicry/induction of
autoimmunity in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is concern that vaccines geared towards the
generation of protective immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may increase the risk of
autoreactivity—particularly in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease and associated immune
dysregulation. Because patients with underlying autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic inflammatory
myopathy, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and primary Sjogren’s syndrome were not included in the
original trials of vaccines targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, there is a clear unmet need to better
understand the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patient populations—both in terms of vaccine
response as well as the potential for disease exacerbation/development of de novo autoimmune manifestations.
Coupled with our well-established, longitudinal rheumatic disease database/biorepository that includes an
integrated data management system (RDMS=Rheumatic Disease Data Management System), our experience
with the use of remote digital platforms and assessment of patient reported outcomes (PROs) makes us uniquely
positioned to conduct successful observational studies of vaccine-induced clinical/immunological responses. To
evaluate the relationship between changes in clinical disease activity and vaccine-induced autoreactivity, we
have 3 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will use general as well as disease-specific PROs at defined time
points pre- and post-vaccination to assess changes in disease activity over a 12 month period—and compare
these changes to pre-vaccination fluctuations in disease activity over a parallel time frame. In Specific Aim 2,
we will apply novel, radiolabel-free methods of immunoprecipitation and Difference in Gel Electrophoresis to
assess corresponding serum samples collected at pre- and post-vaccination time points and define vaccine-
induced shifts in autoantibody profile as well as the development of anti-spike protein antibodies. In Specific
Aim 3, we will use different statistical models to evaluate the relationship between these antibody profiles and
changes in clinical disease activity/de novo autoimmune manifestations. Successful completion of these aims
will directly address the existing knowledge gap surrounding vaccine responses in understudied rheumatic
disease patient populations and establish a clinical cohort/biorepository that will serve as an unparalleled
resource for biomarker development as well as future research in vaccine-associated immune alterations."
10793574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity,
functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before
BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The
uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years
delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are
identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and
function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures,
can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in
the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two
distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML)
model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model.
We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward
processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions
and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD-
I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural
classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify
and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual
conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior
associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years
recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent
unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient
youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without
BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function
and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized
cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year
follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment
of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess
disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and
behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk
calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention."
10790169,"Coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease are the leading causes of atherosclerotic morbidity along
with stroke. More than a million percutaneous coronary and peripheral interventions such as balloon angioplasty
and stent deployment are performed in the US alone every year. A thin guidewire and catheter are used in all of
these procedures while current IVUS imaging probes are infrequently used because of size and complexity. Our
aim is to integrate intravascular ultrasound capability to regular guidewires and catheters so that
interventionalists can use this technique as a routine in-situ imaging and measurement tool before, during and
after interventions without prolonging the procedure time by providing easy to interpret simple metrics such as
lumen size, calcification arc and length, for procedure planning and evaluation. The proposed application aims
to explore and demonstrate the critical steps to build such systems. It uses a novel flexible thin film piezoelectric
material (PiezoPaint) to form conformal linear and interlaced arrays of transducers operating in the 10-30MHz
range on flexible cylindrical structures. It exploits recent advances in application specific integrated circuits
(ASICs) by the Degertekin group for front end electronics that would fit on guidewires and catheters.
Furthermore, an optical encoding scheme is proposed to accurately determine axial distances during pullback
or insertion to implement a simplified method to generate 3D maps of arteries as opposed to additional pullback
hardware or complex angiography and software-based registration. Specifically, we will modify the current
process we use to coat and pattern PiezoPaint on optical fibers to form arrays on guidewires and catheters with
electrical interconnect. Arrays will be fabricated on sections of guidewires and catheter samples with polyimide
substrates including patterned electrodes and wiring. Different array geometries will be evaluated through
simulations and experiments in terms of SNR, measurement resolution and imaging performance to guide
fabrication. To couple the optical encoder to the hemostatis valve and to the guidewire/catheter, a mechanical
design will be developed and implemented. The arrays and ASICs will be electrically connected and the axial
distance encoding system and front end electronics will be synchronized to complete the setup. For experimental
evaluation, 3D phantoms will be designed with guidance from interventional cardiologist collaborators from
Emory University and experiments will be performed assess performance on lumen sizing, echo amplitude
mapping and imaging before moving to experiments on ex-vivo samples. The potential impact of this project is
manifold. Just the demonstration of “ultrasound active” guidewire with simple metrology capability can lead to
applications in coronary and neurovascular interventions. Integration of ultrasound measurement capability on
guidewires and balloon catheters along with simplified position tracking and data interpretation can make this
much more widely used modality in percutaneous coronary and peripheral interventions."
10910225,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE 1
The broad, long-range objective of Core 1 (Facility Management, Maintenance, and Operations Core) for
the New England Regional Biosafety Laboratory (NERBL) is to ensure that research or tasks directed to
promoting research on or responding to pathogens of pandemic potential, and other emerging infections
(PPP/EI), are safely, efficiently, and rigorously accomplished. Although physical infrastructure support, daily
operations (both building and laboratory related), and laboratory/vivarium activities are typically
compartmentalized functions with separate staffing and specialized expertise, redundancy of functions is an
essential tenet for biocontainment. As such, the primary goal of Core 1 is to ensure that NERBL staff are
trained in core competencies for facility management, maintenance, and operation, ensuring
redundancy of key functions, including biosafety, at all times. The two elements associated with this Core
are: 1) sustainability of physical infrastructure, including continuous monitoring of BSL-3 containment systems;
decontamination, retesting, and certification of BSL-3 containment facilities; preventive maintenance in
accordance with a repair and lifecycle replacement plan for critical existing equipment and building systems
necessary for BSL-3/ABSL3 operations; and emergency repair/replacement of essential equipment and
building systems required for operating the NERBL; and 2) regulatory compliance, including all existing and
future biosecurity directives related to control of select agents and other highly pathogenic agents; and
confirming that the NERBL and staff adhere to all relevant environmental health and biosafety requirements.
By directly engaging all staff in maintenance of physical facility infrastructure and associated compliance
activities, they gain a deep understanding regarding foundational elements that underly success of the NERBL.
This also creates a truly collaborative partnership whose success is reliant upon participation by all
stakeholders. To achieve these goals, we will train and maintain additional staff in facility management,
maintenance and operations, create and optimize standard operating procedures that ensure safe and secure
operation of the NERBL, and develop fiscal and resource management plans that support long-term
sustainability and success of research activities responsive to both investigator-initiated requests and PPP/EI
NIAID specific priorities."
10910226,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE 2
The broad, long-range objectives of Core 2 (Biosafety Level 3 Practices ) for the New England Regional
Biosafety Laboratory (NERBL) are to ensure that research or tasks directed to promoting research on or
responding to pathogens of pandemic potential, and other emerging infections (PPP/EI), are safely, efficiently,
and rigorously accomplished. Research conducted in biocontainment relies on trained personnel with
adequate knowledge to safely work in both laboratory and vivarium spaces. Although the Tufts institutional
biosafety and environmental hygiene programs provide periodic general training to all NERBL staff, this is not
standardized and much of the project specific instruction is administered by individual PIs or associated staff.
As such, knowledge regarding practices and procedures is uneven across the NERBL staff resulting in lack of
depth with respect to skills required for operating specific technologies or working in certain biocontainment
settings. There is also no regular plan for staff re-training to maintain basic competencies which impacts
familiarity with activities that are not routinely performed. Together, these limitations have constrained the
scope research activities routinely undertaken in the NERBL. To address this gap, Core 2 will focus on
developing and maintaining a team that possesses core competencies in biocontainment work,
spanning the practices and procedures for general BSL3 laboratory and vivarium research as well as
for that of building operations. Such instruction will cover essential skills in biocontainment management,
principles of emergency and incident response, best practices for safe operation of equipment and
performance of procedures, use of newer technologies, as well as animal husbandry and welfare in
containment. Specifically, we will optimize biosafety and biosecurity practices and procedures, standardize
emergency and incident response/life safety trainings, implement best practices trainings across the NERBL
and coordinate the Select Agent program. Although staff from Core 2 will lead the trainings, all NERBL staff
will regularly participate in this effort. Additionally, we will employ a train-the-trainer approach within Core 2 to
enhance depth of expertise and expand capacities for process improvement."

 Midlife Black women (ages 45-64) have a 69% greater risk of suffering a cardiovascular disease (CVD)
related mortality compared to White women. Among midlife Black women who suffer a myocardial infarction,
10% will die within one year compared to only 5% of White women. Tailored interventions are recommended to
address the stark disparities experienced by midlife Black women. Chronic stress, in particular daily life stress,
contributes to the development of CVD and can impede adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors associated with
optimal cardiovascular health. Midlife Black women experience multiple competing stressors and have been
identified as an at-risk group for chronic disease and poor health outcomes. The Midlife Black Women’s Stress
and Wellness intervention (B-SWELL) is a culturally tailored, community-based intervention designed to lower
stress and increase CVD risk awareness and the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. The B-SWELL was
deemed feasible in a virtual trial with low attrition and high satisfaction. Outcome trends for B-SWELL
participants were positive but regressed 4 weeks post intervention, suggesting a need for modification.
 The purpose of this study is to modify the B-SWELL and increase individualization prior to conducting a
randomized control pilot trial (RCT). Modifications will include 1) the addition of 1:1 coaching during the 8-week
intervention and coaching booster sessions at 10- and 14-weeks post intervention for B-SWELL participants, 2)
offering choice in the mode of delivery (virtual or in person) and receipt (paper binder, tablet, or USB), 3) use of
community facilitators, and 4) development of a training plan for community facilitators. The literature suggests
that individualization is key to reach at-risk populations, such as midlife Black women, and impact the existing
health disparities. Individualization requires insight and knowledge of the needs, beliefs, and experiences of
the targeted population. Community participatory methods were used at each stage of the B-SWELL
development, giving voice to midlife Black women. The proposed RCT will randomize 64 midlife Black women
to either the B-SWELL (n=32) or an attention control (n=32) group. We hypothesize that the modified B-
SWELL participants will have greater self-efficacy, lower perceived stress, higher scores for cardiovascular
health (as measured by the American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 metrics), and sustained outcome
trends compared to control. We expect the modifications will increase sustainability of the B-SWELL by
strengthening ties with the community and minimizing the impact of social determinants of health through
choice, allowing participants to select the mode of delivery and receipt that best fits their needs.
 Our immediate goal is to optimize delivery of the B-SWELL and assess the preferences of midlife Black
women, thus increasing our knowledge about tailoring and targeting future interventions or awareness
campaigns for this at-risk subpopulation. Our long-term goal is to establish the B-SWELL as a sustainable
community-based intervention capable of addressing CVD risk in midlife Black women."

Hypertension is the most common risk factor for heart disease and stroke; therefore, it is important to understand
the pathogenesis of hypertension for better prevention and treatment. Rare Mendelian causes of hypertension
identify previously unrecognized physiological pathways and networks, which can illuminate new treatments for
disease. The Mendelian syndrome Familial Hyperkalemic Hypertension (FHHt, or pseudohypoaldosteronism
type II) is a monogenic disease resulting from mutations which increase expression of with-no-lysine kinases
(WNKs). Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) were recently discovered to regulate blood pressure via proteasomal
degradation of WNKs. Regulation of CRL activity is facilitated by the deneddylase, COP9 Signalosome (CSN),
which binds to the complex and removes the ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8. A mutation in cullin 3 (CUL3) causes
FHHt and was shown, by in vitro analysis, to have enhanced CUL3 neddylation, increased degradation of the
substrate adaptor kelch-like 3 (KLHL3), and decreased binding to the CSN. We hypothesized that the impaired
interaction with the CSN was integral to the disease. The CSN is a well-studied multi-subunit protein, but the
data here provides the first evidence that disordered CSN activity in the kidney may relate to hypertension and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). The applicant has characterized a genetic mouse model of CSN dysfunction, in
which the catalytic subunit of the CSN, Jab1 is deleted from kidney-tubule cells (KS-Jab1-/-). These mice
developed an unusual phenotype; there was decreased KLHL3 and upregulation of the WNK-SPAK pathway
akin to FHHt, however, several unexpected consequences of Jab1 deletion throughout the nephron were noted
that made the observed phenotype differ from the human disease. This included a decrease in the abundance
of the Na-Cl co-transporter (NCC) after several weeks, and progressive and spontaneous kidney fibrosis,
mimicking chronic kidney disease. Here, the applicant proposes to further explore these provocative results in
three specific aims. Aim 1 will continue to test the hypothesis that impaired CSN function causes FHHt by
generating mouse models that more faithfully mimic the disease mutation. In Aim 2, a combination of in vitro and
in vivo techniques will be used to determine whether the CSN plays a role in modulating NCC directly. Aim 3 will
examine the kidney damage caused by deletion of Jab1. Nrf2 accumulation will be investigated as a possible
mechanism for the damage by generating Jab1 and Nrf2 double knockout mice. In addition to successful
completion of these aims the mentoring and scientific environment make the applicant an ideal candidate to
develop independence in renal physiology research. The proposed research will help reveal the mechanisms
involved in regulation of blood pressure through the CUL3-KLHL3-WNK4 pathway which could lead to
pharmaceutical treatment of hypertension by targeting CRLs, or the CSN. The results will also open two entirely
new areas of focus, the role that the CSN plays in regulating NCC degradation and the potential role played by
the CSN in mediating or accelerating the development of chronic kidney disease."

Despite significant advances in survival and the decreased risk of major brain injury in premature infants, the
persistent high prevalence of long-term remains a major public health problem, with enormous personal,
familial, and societal costs. There is growing evidence that impaired structural brain development is detectable
in premature infants before term corrected age, even without overt destructive brain injury. Together these
observations suggest that brain dysmaturation in an artificial ex-utero environment disturbs neuropsychological
development in prematurity survivors. In turn, this points to ongoing gaps between the effectiveness of current
support/protection strategies for ex-utero preterm brain development, and that provided by the normal in-utero
environment. Critical to closing this gap is identifying the disruptive interactions between the complex shifting
landscape of brain maturation/vulnerability, and preterm ex-utero exposures, among which circulatory and
oxygenation (C/O) exposures are considered a leading cause of neuropsychologic impairment. To approach
this challenge the necessary steps are: to identify the earliest deviations of ex-utero brain maturation compared
to normal in-utero brain maturation; to identify the temporal relationship between the onset of brain
dysmaturation and preceding C/O exposures; and, to confirm that the early preterm maturational changes
predict structural brain development at term-corrected age, and later functional outcome. To date, progress
has been impeded by (i) the lack of reference data for normal in-utero brain development, (ii) the lack of serial
measurements of ex-utero preterm brain development, and (iii) the lack concurrent biomarkers that capture
continuous C/O exposures. Using our large repository of normal in-utero brain development and multimodal
quantitative MRI, our preliminary studies show significant anatomic differences in brain development occurring
in utero vs. ex utero, detectable well before term-equivalent age. We have developed systems for measuring
and analyzing continuous physiological signals in sick preterm infants. In this proposal we combine serial 4-
weekly MRI with concurrent exposure measurements in infants born <36 weeks gestation, to establish the
relationship between disturbed early brain maturation, specific preterm C/O exposures, and their association
with long-term neuropsychological impairment. These findings may inform future brain-oriented support of
premature infants, identify specific targets for neuroprotection, and lead to improved neuropsychological
outcomes."

Osteoporosis is under diagnosed and under treated. It is essential that we develop novel tools for early detection
and treatment strategies to reduce the number of fragility fractures that accompany aging. Systemic hypertension
is another disease of aging that commonly co-exists with osteoporosis and likely predisposes individuals to the
disease. In this multidisciplinary project, we will investigate a common molecular basis between hypertension
and osteoporosis that weakens bone during aging. Our preliminary data indicate that experimental hypertension
involving mice is associated with a striking loss in bone strength, which is mediated in part by the production of
colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in the bone marrow. The first goal of the project will be to test the hypothesis
that enhanced endothelial cell deformation and elevated blood pressure promote the age-related decline in bone
strength. We will employ cell culture experiments in which endothelial cells are dynamically stretched below
human monocytes with and without exogenous recombinant proteins to determine if factors released by the
activated endothelium promote osteoclast differentiation. In addition, we will lower blood pressure of aged mice
and determine if this improves bone strength by reducing inflammatory cytokines that favor bone resorption. The
second goal will be to test the hypothesis that enhanced sympathetic tone in aging and hypertension promotes
immune activation and bone loss. We are experts at modulating sympathetic tone using a technique called
Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs and by local denervation techniques. Thus, we will
increase sympathetic tone to determine if this mimics the age-related decline in bone strength and decrease
sympathetic tone to determine if this prevents hypertension and aging-induced loss in bone strength. The third
goal will be to delete the endothelial CSF1 gene in adult mice to firmly establish the endothelium as a mediator
of osteoporosis. Finally, our prior work has established a critical role of the cytokine interleukin (IL) 17A in
hypertension, and others have shown that it plays a critical role in bone loss due estrogen withdrawal
(menopause). We will therefore generate mutant mice that will allow deletion of IL17 receptor A in adult mice
and determine if this prevents hypertension-related bone loss. As a translational goal, we will treat aged or
hypertensive mice with a control antibody and vehicle, a neutralizing anti-CSF1 antibody, or an IL-17RA
antagonist and determine if these strategies improve bone strength. In all aims we will 1) monitor blood pressure
and bone mass, 2) assess immune cell profiles in the bone marrow, and 3) comprehensively characterize bone
strength including toughness and other bone quality measurements. By understanding how hypertension affects
bone marrow in the context of aging and by working as a collaborative research team comprised of different skill
sets, new therapeutic strategies can be identified to prevent the age-related increase in fracture risk."

Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and
environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent
neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the
neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely
limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development
or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients,
which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap,
our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental
mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental
exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key
prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the
neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S.
pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals
in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal
testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed
prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood
(~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal
mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first
trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against
prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in
umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm
marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal
associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of
metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures
simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental
mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment.
This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal
mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential
prenatal nutritional intervention strategies."

 Many “anti-cancer” diets are promoted in popular culture for cancer prevention and treatment, reflecting the
enthusiasm of patients, clinicians, and researchers alike for using diet to improve patient prognosis. Many of
these dietary recommendations, however, are poorly supported by scientific evidence. While diet is a known
contributor to cancer risk, how diet influences survival in patients who already have cancer is poorly understood.
This is a key distinction because many patients are only motivated to make dietary changes after receiving a
cancer diagnosis. Moreover, because dietary advice for patients must be given in the context of other treatment
strategies, it is important to determine how diet might enhance or antagonize standard-of-care and emerging
cancer therapies. Therefore, there is a critical need to define the molecular mechanisms that underlie dietary
effects on cancer progression and therapy before it will be possible to integrate diet effectively into cancer
treatment. Uncovering these mechanisms will transform precision nutrition therapeutic approaches, which aim
to tailor dietary changes with particular therapies to target specific tumor types.
 Recent work in cancer metabolism has shown that changes to nutrient levels in the tumor microenvironment
are key to determining the impacts of dietary interventions on tumor metabolism, growth, and responses to
therapy. Interactions between whole-body and tumor lipid metabolism have a central role in linking diet with
cancer progression. Lipids are synthesized from fatty acids, which can be saturated, monounsaturated, or
polyunsaturated, depending on the number of double bonds they contain. Cellular fatty acid saturation is tightly
regulated to maintain membrane structure and cellular function. Previous data shows that dietary manipulations
can alter the balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids within tumors. The proposed research will
define the mechanisms by which diet dysregulates tumor fatty acid saturation states to influence tumor
progression and therapy responses. Mouse pancreatic and lung cancer models will be used to examine: (1) how
a caloric restriction diet alters tumor-intrinsic polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, thereby defining dietary
contexts under which this pathway can be therapeutically targeted; (2) how excessive saturated fatty acid
consumption induces lipotoxic stress in tumors and generates resistance to cancer therapy, the reversal of which
could be a strategy to enhance therapy responses; and (3) how manipulating the fat type in diets alters tumor
metabolism and growth in a predictable manner by providing tumors with different relative amounts of saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to dietary fat type-associated metabolic
dependencies that can be therapeutically exploited. These studies will define the metabolic mechanisms
underlying how diet-induced changes to whole-body and tumor lipid metabolism interact with cancer therapies.
The expected outcomes will set the foundation for the improved design of future translational studies that use
dietary interventions as an assistive therapy for cancer treatment."

The visual system has emerged as a premier model for understanding information processing by neurons.
Within vision, the submodality of color provides a particularly attractive experimental platform: we know a
tremendous amount about the phenomenology of color perception and can explain some aspects of color
perception, quantitatively and with high precision, by well understood physiological processes. As a result of
this knowledge, we can quickly and accurately diagnose many distinct forms of color blindness and can build
devices that render colors accurately. On the other hand, surprising holes in our knowledge remain. The
proposed research will fill these holes in our knowledge by revealing the specializations of three types of
neurons in area V1 for color vision. Three specific aims are planned: 1) Electrophysiological characterization of
parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. 2) Testing the hypothesis that color-sensitive complex cells
enhance edges between materials of different reflectance. 3) Testing the hypothesis that double-opponent
cells are the physiological basis for color induction by simultaneous color contrast. The proposed experiments
will extend our knowledge toward an understanding of the principles that give rise to perception and its
disorders. Such an understanding promises to provide the means to promote recovery of visual function
following trauma or neurological disease."

 The inability to maintain abstinence is a trademark of addiction yet effective maintenance therapies
remain elusive. Women may face unique issues with substance abuse treatment, as research indicates that
psychological and biological responses to drugs of abuse differ in women compared to men. Women tend to
show greater drug dependence, progress more quickly from casual drug use to dependence, have greater
difficulty quitting, and have shorter periods of abstinence than men. These effects have been similarly observed
in female animal models. Thus, there is a crucial need for understanding circuit dynamics and molecular
signatures that drive robust behavioral sex differences impeding abstinence success. We have developed a
novel behavioral model termed the seeking-persistence paradigm (SPP) that was adapted from standard drug
abstinence paradigms. The seeking-persistence paradigm is used to investigate the influence of intervention
during initial abstinence on long-term drug-seeking behaviors. Indeed, cocaine-seeking during initial abstinence
strongly correlates with seeking after drug-abstinence. These results reflect clinical studies indicating that craving
during initial abstinence predicts relapse rates. Using this paradigm in combination with electrophysiological,
chemogenetic, and functional genomic methods, we aim to ultimately provide novel targets for therapeutics by
investigating the role of sex-specific signaling in driving cocaine seeking persistence. We have previously
identified that the dorsal hippocampus CA1 is a crucial downstream target for noradrenergic (NE) modulation of
cocaine-seeking on ED1. Notably, the locus coeruleus (LC) (NE)-CA1 signal in this behavior appears female-
specific, and we hypothesize that recruitment of this pathway engages increased cocaine-seeking observed in
females. In year 1 of the K99 phase, I will first determine if this sex difference involves phasic or tonic locus
coeruleus firing on ED1 using unit recordings in behaving rats. In year 2 of the K99 phase, I will use RNA-
sequencing and bioinformatics analyses to identify a molecular signature in CA1 of increased cocaine-seeking
behavior. Next, in my independent phase (R00) I will combine prior training in chemogenetic techniques with
new training in awake behaving electrophysiology to identify the effects of inhibition or activation of LC inputs to
dorsal hippocampus CA1 on ED1 cocaine seeking and cocaine seeking-persistence, using PRSx8 promoter
driven designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) that permit specific expression in
LC-NE neurons. Subsequently, I will use my bioinformatics training to identify clusters of transcripts that
associate with cocaine-seeking resilience by examining transcripts that negatively correlate to cocaine-seeking
behavior. These experiments will therefore characterize the role of the LC(NE)-CA1 pathway in driving cocaine-
seeking behavior and identify novel gene targets in CA1 associated with sex differences in cocaine-seeking. The
ultimate goal of this research is to identify the behavioral significance of neural activity (Aim 1), activated
transcripts (Aim 2), and recruited circuits (Aim 3) driving sex differences in cocaine-seeking SPP."
10795836,"Piezo1 and Piezo2 ion channels are essential for our senses of touch and proprioception, and the detection of
lung stretch and vascular blood flow. As of today, 8 distinct human diseases have been associated with 61
single-point mutations in Piezos, many of which are not obviously related to their known physiological
functions. While for most mutations their effects on Piezo function are unknown, the few mutations studied thus
far distinctly affect Piezo inactivation, which is itself not understood mechanistically. The overall objective of this application is a comprehensive functional characterization of all currently-known human disease-related mutations in mechanically-activated Piezo ion channels and solving the mechanism of inactivation. Our rationale is that by determining functional effects of each point-mutation and by knowing the mechanism of Piezo inactivation we take the two first steps necessary for understanding these diseases. Our central hypothesis is that single-point mutations in Piezos that have been associated with human diseases affect membrane expression, ion permeation, or open probability, and that Piezo inactivation is determined by specific structures (residues/domains) within the C-terminal-extracellular domain (CED). The scientific premise for this hypothesis is based on the facts, that i) human patients diagnosed with colorectal polyposis, dehydrated stomatocytosis, lymphatic dysplasia, hemolytic anemia, and distal arthrogryposis, Marden-Walker syndrome, Gordon syndrome, microphthalmia are associated with mutations in Piezo1 and Piezo2, respectively, that ii) inactivation is conferred by the CED and the known main target of functional
modulation of Piezos by either mutations, ligands, and voltage, and iii) our own studies showing that human
disease-related point-mutations that alter inactivation kinetics profoundly change transduction of repetitive
mechanical stimuli, which Piezos likely encounter during mechanical vibrations, repetitive lung stretch during
breathing, or pulsating blood flow upon heart beating. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses:
Aim1: Determine the effects of 61 single-point mutations on Piezo1 and Piezo2 function; Aim2: Identification of
the structures and molecular mechanism of inactivation. The proposed research is innovative, because we explore the functional consequences of 61 human Piezo1 and Piezo2 disease-related single-point mutations, nearly all of which have remained uncharacterized on a functional level, and because we will identify the mechanism of inactivation and its structural correlates, both of which are currently unknown. The significance of this study is a comprehensive biophysical analysis of functional effects of Piezo point-mutations that have been associated with human diseases of unknown mechanisms, and the mechanistic and structural exploration of inactivation as their target. This knowledge will give deep insight into the mechanisms underlying these diseases and guide strategies for further mechanistic
explorations, effective diagnosis and disease treatment."

Air pollution represents a major public health threat in India, affecting a quarter of the country’s population at
extreme levels. The evidence on health impacts of air pollution, which mainly comes from high income countries,
is not transferable to LMICs like India with complex urban environments and high pollution levels. The proposal
entitled “1/2-GEOHealth Health Effects of Selected Environmental Exposomes Across the Life CourSe
(HEALS)-India” builds on the research and infrastructure established in the ongoing (to be completed on
7/30/2021), Air pollution and Health GEOHealth Program. In the current proposal we aim to extend our exposure
assessments to include a range of air pollutants: particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5m (PM2.5),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and extremes of temperature to assess the exposomes at fine
spatiotemporal resolutions across different locations in India (Delhi, Chennai, Sonipat, Vizag, Pune, Hyderabad
and Bikaner). Additionally, we will evaluate the composition of PM2.5 in these locations and measure real time
exposures in a subset of the participants. These exposomes will be related to a range of chronic non-
communicable diseases across the life course using inter-digitating cohorts. This will be achieved by leveraging
existing pregnancy, children, adult, and older adult cohorts across India. This will help us systematically assess
the vulnerable populations across pregnancy, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adult and older adult groups. We
will also address how environmental exposomes interact with gender, socio-economic status, rural-urban
settings, and pre-existing illnesses in impacting the health outcomes. Further, we will replicate the findings from
our epigenome-wide scan (from the ongoing study) in larger set of samples to validate DNA methylation profiles
associated with incident myocardial infarction and explore if these epigenetic mechanisms mediate the effect of
exposomes on myocardial infarction. Through this joint application, we will accelerate scientific infrastructure
development, enhance research training to support research needed to characterize the relationship between
environmental exposomes and health outcomes across the lifespan in India. The study will be led by Dr.
Prabhakaran from CCDC and Dr. Reddy from PHFI and Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Sieber from HSPH, who will be
assisted by the: 1) External Advisory Committee; 2) Administrative Oversight Committee; 3) Training Oversight
Committee; 4) Program coordination personnel at HSPH and CCDC; and 5) Supervisory teams for individual
trainees (Indian & HSPH mentors). The proposed study findings will identify the policy reforms needed to address
the growing burden of air pollution and protect the large at-risk population. The training of the Indian scientists
in the linked U2R in the area of environmental health will build capacity to undertake relevant studies and apply
for future grants to address the threat from adverse environmental exposures in India."

resistance cannot be ignored, particularly in view of its large-­scale use in many endemic. Our long-­term goal is 
to discover a new orally active single-­dose antischistosomal drug with activities against all parasite stages and 
with a novel mechanism of action. The objective of this proposal is to identify one or more antischistosomal 
drug development candidates. To accomplish this objective, we will optimize four promising antischistosomal 
chemotypes. We will also continue our investigation into the host-­mediated antischistosomal mode of action of 
aryl hydantoin drug candidate AR102. We propose four specific aims: 1) to synthesize and characterize target 
compounds; 2) to assess pharmacokinetic properties and antischistosomal activity of target compounds; 3) to 
further profile selected target compounds using more rigorous assays; and 4) to investigate the mode of action 
of drug candidate AR102. Compound design will be informed by existing SAR and will maximize structural 
diversity guided by prospective in silico physicochemical profiling. Based on iterative feedback from 
physicochemical profiling, in vitro ADME, and cytotoxicity (SA 1), ex vivo and in vivo antischistosomal activity 
and in vivo ADME (SA 2 and 3), new structural hypotheses will arise, and we will synthesize additional target 
compounds. Target compounds will progress through the various assays using clearly defined progression 
criteria. We suggest that this proposed research is innovative for several reasons First, the aryl hydantoins and 
ozonides have proven in vivo antischistosomal efficacy, but have very low ex vivo (in vitro) activity, the reverse 
of the usual situation where lead compounds have in vitro but no in vivo activity. Second, the azonine keto 
lactam chemotype and backup tricyclic imidazolidin-­4-­one compound series are examples of relatively rare 
medium-­ring compounds (8 to 11 atoms). Third, we seek to demarcate the unique host-­mediated mode of 
action of antischistosomal drug candidate AR102. The expected outcome from this work is to identify one or 
more antischistosomal drug development candidates effective against all parasite stages. For antischistosomal 
drug candidate AR102, we will define its host-­mediated antischistosomal mode of action. This proposed 
research is significant because a new drug would be important in the chemotherapy of drug-­resistant 
schistosomiasis and likely be valuable in integrated control programs to curb this parasitic disease."

UCDCCC is poised to exploit unique institutional strengths in serving as a laboratory resource for clinical trials
and contributing to hypothesis-driven clinical research.
Based on over two decades of already serving as the clinical trials “hub” for accrual to NCI-sponsored studies
throughout North-Central California, this NCTN UG1 initiative creates a additional opportunities for UCDCCC to
both increase main site accrual and to extend access to NCTN trials into the community through the UCDCCC
Cancer Care Network and affiliate site, which includes substantial underserved, rural and minority patient
populations. In summary, UCDCCC represents an interdisciplinary organizational and leadership structure
linked to a clinical trials program that will be impactful and ensure robust accrual to NCTN trials."
10798181,"Summary
 Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be
able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews
with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two
major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to
psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers.
We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that
show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and
computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks
that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread
screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need
determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published
prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500
healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through
the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory
ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and
historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize
that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further
hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR
nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for
translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for
psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS
performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a
continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict
symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on
the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators
that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative
symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative
symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project
will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge
computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk."
10798290,"Disentangling the Mechanisms of Coronary Blood Flow Regulation through Multi-scale Modeling
The coronary circulation is regulated by numerous mechanisms that precisely modulate myocardial perfusion
to ensure that myocardial oxygen delivery (supply) is adequate to meet the metabolic requirements for ATP
production (demand). This balance between coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2)
is preserved over a variety of patho-physiologic perturbations, including critical reductions in perfusion
pressure which occur distal to sites of atherosclerotic stenosis. The innate ability of the coronary circulation to
maintain blood flow constant as driving pressures are reduced to values as low as 40-60 mmHg is an essential
phenomenon that mitigates hypoperfusion, cardiac dysfunction, and overt ischemic injury. Despite the crucial
nature of this intrinsic response, understanding the mechanisms responsible for coronary pressure-flow
autoregulation remains one of the most fundamental questions in the coronary field today.
The most prominent theories to explain coronary autoregulatory behavior are the local metabolic and myogenic
hypotheses. However, given that these pathways share common end-effector pathways and microvascular
responses, differ transmurally across layers of the myocardium, and are influenced by structural and contractile
properties of the myocardium, our knowledge remains rather phenomenological. The primary goal of this
proposal is to address this deficit through computational and experimental studies to build, test, and refine
competing hypotheses for the metabolic mechanism in the context of a multi-scale model of coronary flow
regulation. Our approach builds on our recent efforts with constrained mixture theory models and in vivo
assessment of coronary pressure at zero-flow (Pzf), an index of underlying myogenic tone. Applying this
experimental and modeling framework to test and refine hypotheses regarding pathologically over-active
myogenic response in coronary microvascular dysfunction associated with obesity will provide further insight
into short- vs. long-term impact of microvascular adaptions in health and disease."
10795435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oromanual food-handling – in which the hands and forelimbs work in a coordinated manner with the mouth and
jaw to manipulate and consume a food item – is a fundamental behavior common to many rodent species as
well as primates. Despite its ethological significance, oromanual food-handling has received remarkably little
experimental attention, reflecting the technical challenges of recording at sufficient spatiotemporal resolution a
behavior involving small, fast, and often visually occluded movements. We recently initiated efforts to overcome
these challenges, developing paradigms for analyzing food-handling in mice using high-speed close-up video
methods coupled with AI-based kinematic tracking. Here we propose to build on these advances through a set
of planning activities leading to a powerful new approach for in-depth investigation of this behavior. The overall
objective is to develop new experimental and analytical paradigms for recording food-handling behavior with
high spatiotemporal resolution in freely moving animals, with a focus on understanding how elemental sub-
movements are assembled into distinct goal-directed actions coordinated across multiple body parts. The
technical approach includes design of a videographic recording arena incorporating a robotic camera positioning
system. Electromyography from jaw-controller and forelimb muscles in freely moving mice will enable
characterization of the elements of dexterous coordination involved in manipulating the food with both hands and
jaw. Intranasal detection of breathing will enable characterization of sniff-related movements during food-
handling, posited to represent an additional aspect of the behavior engaging the olfactory and respiratory
systems. Exploratory studies will extend the approach in comparative, ecological, and developmental directions.
The analytical approach will conceptualize the behavior in terms of the multiple components of the motor plant
and behavioral modes and actions, including detailed ethogramming and incorporating machine learning-based
tracking, modeling, and related computational methods. The anticipated results will constitute an innovative
paradigm for quantitative analysis of food-handling, setting the stage for a future investigation of the neural
mechanisms of this natural form of goal-directed dexterous behavior. Results from this research program
furthermore have high potential to identify common principles of natural, complex, motor behavior in mammals
in general."
10802422,"The Research Center for Child Well-Being at the University of South Carolina focuses on prevention and risk 
reduction in two areas of critical well-being for children ages 2-10: (1) mental, emotional, and behavioral 
problems; and, (2) obesogenic behaviors. Effective prevention in both areas is a public health necessity that 
depends on a strong scientific workforce to move the field forward. Accordingly, the Center is building capacity 
by facilitating the development of promising early-stage investigators who can conduct and extend preventive 
intervention research in both critical areas. The Administrative Core facility leads, implements, and fosters the 
main activities and research necessary for success of the Center. The overarching goal is to create and 
cultivate a high-impact center committed to the development of scientists concentrating on the prevention and 
reduction of mental, emotional, behavioral, and unhealthy-lifestyle problems, which will be met through four 
specific aims. Aim1 is to enact the leadership, administration, and infrastructure essential for Center operations 
to achieve its mission, building on strong institutional support that includes targeted hiring of several new 
faculty, and drawing on the engagement of a local Community Advisory Board. Aim2 is to implement and 
supervise a faculty development plan designed to accelerate the trajectories of promising early-stage 
investigators toward independence and to foster additional investigators via pilot seed projects and a second 
wave of research projects. Aim3 is to coordinate and promote connections between Center members and the 
Center’s core research facilities—the Clinical Trials Logistics Core and the Statistical and Data Management 
Core, and ensure that the Center’s early-stage investigators receive top priority for support from the Cores. 
Aim4 is to implement planned Center activities and procedures designed to promote a cohesive and 
collaborative research environment, to relate the Center to other pertinent campus resources and colleagues, 
and to advance the Center on a national level. The Administrative Core builds on the University of South 
Carolina’s expertise and leadership in the areas of child mental health, childhood obesity, and preventive 
intervention research aimed at improving child well-being in both domains. Preventive intervention trials done 
well place major demands on the resources and skills of even the most seasoned scientists, but the challenges 
are even more formidable for early career scientists who have access to less infrastructure and more 
constrained funding levels. Consequently, the Administrative Core and associated research facility cores are 
designed to optimize support for the early-stage prevention scientists leading to independent researcher status 
and major contributions to child well-being."
10799687,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are neurodegenerative disorders that are clinically
characterized by progressive dementia and spatial disorientation caused in part by proteotoxicity and neuronal
death. The pathogenic mechanisms causing AD/ADRD have remained elusive, which has led to alternative
hypotheses that defects in central and systemic glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes are potential risk
factors for proteostasis failure and cognitive decline. There is currently no evidence to support a cause or
effect relationship between AD/ADRD and metabolic dysfunction/insulin resistance. Macroautophagy (MA) is a
key homeostatic mechanism that protects against neurogenerative disorders. MA also prevents type 2
diabetes through its effects in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. The role of MA is
well-defined in the mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) neurons in the CNS in preventing obesity and insulin
resistance. Since AD-related proteotoxicity and aging each overwhelms MA function, and because
hypothalamic MA maintains glucose and energy metabolism, we hypothesized that an early event in AD-
related proteotoxicity is disruption of MA in MBH and peripheral tissues, which results in systemic insulin
resistance that in turn, accelerates the progression of AD/ADRD. We recently demonstrated that a novel
isocaloric twice-a-day (ITAD) feeding strategy provides system-wide metabolic benefits by stimulating MA.
Consequently, we propose that ITAD feeding will restore MA and metabolic function and delay cognitive
impairment in AD/ADRD. To that purpose, we will collaborate with other components of this PPG and: (1)
determine the impact of AD-related proteotoxicity on MA and regulation of metabolism in peripheral tissues as
a function of nutritional stress and aging; (2) determine whether metabolic defects in models of AD-related
proteotoxicity originate from compromised hypothalamic MA; and (3) explore whether ITAD feeding activates
MA and prevents metabolic and cognitive defects in AD-related proteotoxicity.
Integration in the PPG: In this project, we will use three complementary mouse models of AD-related
proteotoxicity and AD/ADRD at distinct age groups that will be generated by the Animal Core and tissues will
be shared by all projects. Assessments of metabolism and mechanisms of loss of MA in models of AD-related
proteotoxicity and in response to dietary stress and age will be determined in collaboration with P1. Image-
based assessments of the changes in MA in MBH and peripheral tissues will be done with the Imaging Core.
Characterization of inflammatory changes in peripheral tissues in models of proteotoxicity will be performed in
collaboration with P2 and P3. Analyses and integration of data will be carried out with the help of the
Biostatistics and Data Management Core.
Relevance to public health: Experiments proposed in P4 will test a new hypothesis that development of
diabetes, as a consequence of MA failure in models of AD-related proteotoxicity and AD/ADRD, is a major
contributing factor to the progression of disease. This project may also reveal that a simple, relatively cost-
effective, and immediately translatable approach, ITAD feeding, can delay cognitive failure and extend
healthspan in AD/ADRD patients by restoring MA and improving proteostasis."
10799701,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Cell type-specific gene expression, the basis for complex multicellular life, is achieved through packaging a
common, invariant genome into higher-order chromatin structures with myriad levels of regulation. Covalent post-
translational modifications (PTMs) at specific histone residues are major points of regulation that are dynamically
modified throughout development to ensure proper tissue lineage specification, cell fate transitions, and
maintenance of cell identity. Mutations in histone modifiers, as well as the histone substrates themselves,
underlie a variety of human diseases including cancer. Recurrent lysine-to-methionine mutations at residue 27
of histone H3 (H3 K27M) are found in >80% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), a high-grade pediatric
brain cancer with dismal prognosis. The H3 K27M oncohistone drives gliomagenesis in part through its inhibition
of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the methyltransferase complex responsible for methylating H3K27,
resulting in genome-wide depletion of the repressive mark H3K27me3.
This proposal endeavors to address a long-observed yet poorly characterized aspect of H3K27M-driven PRC2
dysregulation: residual PRC2 activity at focal sites of H3K27me3. Leveraging biochemical, genomic, and cell-
based approaches, the experiments described in this study seek to define the PRC2 subunits necessary for
targeting to, and catalytic activity at, sites of PRC2 recruitment in DIPG cells. These results stand to significantly
deepen our understanding of H3K27M-dysregulated chromatin and may reveal exploitable vulnerabilities for H3
K27M diffuse gliomas.
The training plan outlined in this proposal will be performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison within an
excellent institutional research environment boasting cutting-edge resources, facilities, and dynamic
opportunities for collaboration. Execution of this training plan, under the guidance of expert mentors and
collaborators in fields of cancer biology, chromatin biochemistry, proteomics, and genomics, will provide an
invaluable foundation meant to launch a successful career as a physician-scientist cancer researcher."
10799703,"More than 5 million patients are admitted annually to United States ICUs with average mortality rate reported
ranging from 8-19%, or about 500,000 deaths annually. Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality,
where one in three inpatient deaths are due to sepsis. Incidence of sepsis has been increasing with 1.7 million
sepsis cases and 270,000 deaths per year. Early identification of deterioration has been shown to reduce the
need for patient transfer to higher care units, reduce lengths of stay, and improve survival rates. Each hour of
delay in ICU admission has been associated with a 1.5% increased risk of ICU death and a 1% increase in risk
of hospital death. Many studies support that there is an increase in mortality rate for every hour delay in
antibiotics. Pairing patient risk stratification with appropriate levels of hospital intervention is essential to reduce
risk of mortality. Patients in intermediate units between the levels of monitoring found in floor units and ICUs are
especially difficult to predict possibility of condition deterioration. Automated monitoring, alerts, and trend
analysis are essential to identifying and proactively intervening patients under duress. Current methods of
monitoring patient health have low specificity and have significant room for improvement.
 This project will develop Deep-CDS, a cloud-based deep learning system for context-sensitive clinical
decision support in monitoring and predicting the deterioration of patient health and progression of sepsis risk
factors in real-time to improve outcomes and optimize the management of care across the hospital population.
To support the clinical care team, Deep-CDS provides team members with (a) a clinical care knowledgebase,
(b) an early warning score for deteriorating health conditions, (c) a model for predicting septic conditions, (d)
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, and (e) visualization of patient health status trends. Deep-CDS
addresses NIGMS Priorities for Small Business Development of Sepsis Diagnostics and Therapeutics, NOT-GM-20-
028: 1) Diagnostic tools for emergency department settings; 2) Predictive clinical algorithms and point-of-care
diagnostics; 3) Technologies that combine various types of data for diagnosis of sepsis patients; and 4) Clinical
decision support, including use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, to develop tools for early
recognition of sepsis, assessment of treatment responses and patient deterioration, and long-term prognosis
prediction in various care settings."
10796238,"Project Summary.
 The Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause
of infections in both the hospital setting and in injured military personnel. The
goal of this Research Career Scientist Award is to continue addressing the
mechanisms that regulate virulence and β−lactam resistance in A. baumannii. A
high-frequency switch that regulates the transition between virulent (opaque) and
avirulent (translucent) forms of A. baumannii will be studied using a combination
of genetic and biochemical approaches. We have identified a central role for a
family of TetR-type transcriptional regulators in controlling the virulence switch.
The regulatory network controlling these TetR regulators will be studied. In
addition, we have genetically locked strains in the avirulent state and
demonstrated that they serve as a highly effective live attenuated vaccine. My lab
will address the immunologic parameters that make our vaccine more effective
than a heat killed vaccine.
 In a second project, our work has found that β-lactamase expressing A.
baumannii exhibit changes in cell wall structure and this results in new collateral
vulnerabilities in the cell. We have identified genes that now become essential
only in β-lactamase expressing cells and identified a small molecule that
specifically kills β-lactamase expressing bacteria. The above gene products
represent an entirely new set of bacterial targets for the development of novel
antimicrobials.
 These research projects are highly collaborative and involve VA
investigators at both the Atlanta VAMC and the Louis Stokes VAMC in
Cleveland, OH. This project will continue to foster these collaborations and allow
for the development of new projects. This project will also have an important
training component, where the mentoring of three CDA-2-funded VA
investigators will be provided. Lastly, student and postdoctoral training will
continue to be an integral component of this research plan, with the goal of
developing the next generation of VA scientists."

Biosynthesis
PROJECT SUMMARY
This MIRA application represents the fusion of two complementary research programs that are, broadly
described, directed at the urgent public health threat posed by antibiotic resistance. Infectious diseases are the
leading cause of death world-wide; unfortunately, antibiotic use provides a strong selective pressure that results
in the selection of strains that are resistant to the antibiotic shortly after its deployment as a therapeutic. While
the selection of bacterial resistance to new antibiotics is inevitable, the development of new antibiotics and/or
the identification of new antibacterial targets is essential to stay ahead in our arms race with bacteria. While
antibacterial agents have been developed against multiple bacterial targets, the best target for antibacterial
development has been, and continues to be, the bacterial cell wall. This MIRA application will capitalize on our
discovery of fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs) that have provided unprecedented and heretofore unavailable
tools for the visualization of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) dynamics in real time and in live bacterial cells.
Specifically, we propose additional studies to elucidate the details of bacterial cell division and cell separation in
Bacillus subtilis, and we will develop “turn-on” probes that will enable the study of PG synthesis and dynamics
in real-time and in live bacterial cells. We will also continue our effort directed at the synthesis and mechanistic
study of cyclic depsipeptide antibiotics that inhibit PG biosynthesis. Furthermore, we have recently uncovered
data that suggest the cyclic depsipeptides may have a second mechanism of action; specifically, inhibition of
lipid recycling, an essential activity in the PG biosynthesis pathway. The lipid recycling pathway remains to be
clearly elucidated and, when coupled with dual-mode activity that may be inherent to these cyclic depsipeptides
under study, very promising new avenues for the identification of new antibacterial targets and development of
new antibacterial agents are likely to emerge from this research effort."

The Duke University School of Medicine is applying to continue our participation in the National
Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) as a Lead Academic Participating Site. The goal of this NCI
grant funding is to provide support for ongoing as well as future scientific leadership and clinical
trial infrastructure within the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) in the development and conduct of
clinical trials. The award will further Duke's leadership and substantial accrual to NCI-funded
clinical trials, specifically multi-center, late-phase clinical treatment trials and imaging trials
across a broad range of cancers, modalities, and diverse patient populations as part of NCI’s
overall clinical research program for adults, adolescents, young adults and children with cancer.
An important focus will be an emphasis on trials in special populations, including underserved
populations and rare tumors. The leadership of the 6 Principal Investigators named in the grant
application, along with the faculty of the 8 NCI approved research programs at Duke and the
Duke Central NCTN Office, will provide a strong and efficient backbone for NCTN clinical
research, scientific leadership and patient enrollment effort. Our continued participation as a
member of the Alliance, NRG, ECOG-ACRIN, COG, ETCTN and enrollment in trials offered by
all adult NCI funded NCTN Network Groups, including SWOG through the Cancer Trials
Support Unit (CTSU) mechanism, gives Duke the experience and knowledge needed to lead
and enroll in complex NCI funded research involving multiple cancer sites and treatment
modalities. The definitive evaluation of newly developed therapies for cancer care including
multi-modality treatments, combinations of novel agents, immune approaches and molecularly-
based treatment along with advanced imaging approaches, will benefit patients and
practitioners as well as the entire oncology research community. This grant will also help to
foster an ideal environment to enhance multidisciplinary collaborations and develop the next
generation of clinical investigators dedicated to cancer research. The support provided to Duke
as a Lead Academic Participating Site will be leveraged against the significant scientific and
clinical resources of the Duke Cancer Institute to provide robust participation in a nationally

10800658,"Specific Aims 
Toxoplasma gondii persists in 25-30% of humans worldwide because there are no vaccines to prevent 
infections and current therapies are non-curative (1). The first-line therapy for toxoplasmosis consists of 
pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, which inhibit intracellular parasite replication but are highly toxic and unable to 
eliminate the dormant tissue-encysted stage of T. gondii (2). Thus, there is an urgent need for new non-toxic 
drugs that block T. gondii infectivity in both acute (tachyzoite) and chronic (bradyzoite) life stages. 
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) has emerged as a master regulator of T. gondii infectivity by 
coordinating parasite motility (3, 4). Previously, we determined that a T. gondii guanylate cyclase (TgGC) 
synthesizes cGMP from GTP to stimulate motility for entry and exit of host cells (5). Conditional depletion of 
TgGC paralyzed T. gondii, rendering parasites incapable of establishing infections and causing disease. 
Additionally, we determined that a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (TgPKG) at the plasma membrane acts as 
the central effector of cGMP in T. gondii in both tachyzoites (6) and bradyzoites (7). Chemical inhibition or 
conditional knockdown of TgPKG phenocopied loss of TgGC, completely blocking parasite motility and infectivity 
(6, 8). Furthermore, we determined that TgPKG functions by controlling secretion of microneme proteins that are 
required for parasite motility, host cell invasion, and host cell egress (6). However, the mechanisms by which 
TgPKG controls microneme secretion and motility remain unclear because its substrates have not been 
identified or characterized. We hypothesize that TgPKG regulates T. gondii motility and virulence through 
phosphorylation of proteins that regulate microneme expression and secretion. Here, we will utilize modern 
genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches to test our hypothesis with three independent Specific Aims. 
Specific Aim 1: Identify genes differentially expressed following TgPKG knockdown. TgPKG controls T. 
gondii infectivity by regulating microneme secretion (6). We speculate that TgPKG directly modifies proteins 
required for microneme fusion with the plasma membrane. However, TgPKG may also regulate microneme 
secretion by modulating gene expression since PKGs regulate several transcription factors in other organisms 
(9). Previously, we generated a T. gondii line that expresses TgPKG fused to an auxin-inducible degron that 
allows for rapid and robust depletion of TgPKG with auxin treatment (6). Here we will identify genes that are 
differentially expressed following conditional depletion of TgPKG using RNA-Seq. 
Specific Aim 2: Identify interactors of TgPKG under basal and activated conditions. As with most kinases, 
we predict that TgPKG transiently interacts with its protein substrates following activation. We will use liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify TgPKG interactors captured by TurboID 
biotin-proximity labeling (10) and co-immunoprecipitation. We will treat extracellular parasites with or without a 
cell permeable cGMP analog (PET-cGMP) to distinguish proteins that interact with TgPKG basally or following 
activation. We have already generated an epitope-tagged TgPKG line for co-immunoprecipitation experiments 
(6) and a new TurboID-tagged TgPKG line for kinetic proximity labeling experiments. These two approaches are 
complementary since TurboID will provide a snapshot of proteins in close proximity (<15 nm) to TgPKG in live 
parasites, while co-immunoprecipitation will reveal proteins that directly interact with TgPKG. Furthermore, we 
will simultaneously assess the phosphorylation status each peptide identified, which could be modulated upon 
TgPKG activation if it is a direct substrate. 
Specific Aim 3: Define the TgPKG-dependent phosphoproteome under basal and activated conditions. 
In addition to knowing what TgPKG directly interacts with, it is critical to determine which interactors are 
phosphorylated by TgPKG. Using the TgPKG knockdown line, we will use stable isotope labeling using amino 
acids in cell culture (SILAC) phosphoproteomics to identify and quantify phosphopeptides from extracellular 
parasites treated with or without PET-cGMP in the presence or absence of TgPKG (+/- auxin treatment). 
Overall Impact. This study will provide critical insights into how TgPKG controls T. gondii motility and expose 
additional essential targets for drug development for treating toxoplasmosis. Since PKGs are conserved and 
essential in other apicomplexan parasites, like Plasmodium (11), this study will likely serve as a model for 
apicomplexan PKG function. Candidate substrates of TgPKG will be comprehensively investigated further as the 
subject of NIH R01 proposals going forward."

The overarching goals of the Administrative Core, which will be led by the Center Director, are to (1) oversee
all scientific and administrative operations across projects and participating scientists; (2) maximize integration
and synergies across the four Projects and the Computational Modeling Core; (3) coordinate and implement
training and educational activities within the Center, with a specific focus on attracting new investigators to the
field of affective translational neuroscience from diverse background; and (4) interact with existing resources to
enhance the research, education and community outreach goals of the center. Several initiatives and activities
will be pursued to accomplish these important goals. First, the Administrative Core will oversee day-to-day
activities of the Center, including adherence to regulatory requirements, budget monitoring, and submission of
progress reports. Second, the Core will monitor the progress of each Project and will ensure that data and
information are shared across Center components. Third, the Core will be responsible to support the proposed
scientific priorities by organizing regular meetings for Center Investigators (monthly), Internal Advisory Board
(twice a year), External Advisory Board (once a year), and a monthly Center Speaker Series. Fourth, the Core
will foster the educational/training component of the Center by ensuring ample opportunities for junior faculty,
postdoctoral fellows and students to play important roles in the proposed projects. These career development
efforts will be supplemented by providing annual pilot grants to junior faculty and postdoctoral fellows to
spearhead independent projects expected to further augment the Center’s goals. Moreover, and leveraging
numerous T32 training grants and fellowship opportunities at sites across Projects, the Core will prioritize
recruitment and retention of women and minority scientists. The Center Director and Project PIs all have a
strong mentorship track record (as manifested by the many K, NRSAD, and NARSAD grants they have
sponsored over the years), and plan to maintain this commitment to mentorship during the award period. Fifth,
the Core will develop, maintain and promote a Center website to engage the larger scientific community and
general public; provide a platform to share information across Center investigators; and provide a platform for
data and resource sharing (e.g., to make freely available novel computational models). In addition, in year 5,
the Core will organize a Public Symposium to engage the community and educate them about depression and
mental health more generally as well as the scientific discoveries that emerged from the Center grant. These
efforts will be augmented by a School Outreach Program. Sixth, the Core will proactively engage in outreach
efforts to the regional mental health community and patient advocacy organizations, with a particular focus on
explaining novel conceptualizations of neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., RDoC) and novel treatment targets.
Finally, the Core will be responsible for providing a programmatic evaluation of Center’s activities, output and
impact, which will occur in close collaboration with an annual review by the External Advisory Board."
10800729,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 1, Project Leader: Pizzagalli, McLean Hospital)
The premise of this P50 resubmission is that major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are
characterized by negative biases in approach-avoidance behaviors due to dysregulation within (1) cortico-
striatal-midbrain circuitry and (2) nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide and the nociceptin receptor (NOPR). Project
1 will directly contribute to this goal by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while unmedicated
individuals with current MDD or anxiety or individuals with past MDD perform an approach-avoidance decision-
making task we adapted from non-human primates (Project 3). In Study 1.1, 56 unmedicated individuals with
current MDD or anxiety disorders and 56 demographically matched healthy controls will perform the approach-
avoidance fMRI task after receiving placebo or a NOPR antagonist (which increased approach-related behaviors
in both rats and humans in preliminary studies). In Study 1.2, 48 unmedicated, remitted individuals with past
MDD and 48 healthy controls will perform the approach-avoidance task both before and after a psychosocial
stressor. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that, relative to controls, patients will show aberrant task-related
activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum, and that these
abnormalities will differentially impact dynamic computational decision parameters. In Aim 2, we expect that,
relative to placebo, NOPR antagonism will significantly increase approach-related striatal activation and
corticostriatal connectivity and normalize avoidance-related pACC activation. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that,
from pre- to post-stress, remitted MDD individuals will show significantly decreased approach-related striatal
activation and corticostriatal functional connectivity and dysregulated avoidance-related pACC activation relative
to controls. In Aim 4, expect that abnormal pACC, DLPFC and NAc activation will predict changes in depression,
anhedonia, anxiety, and suicidality as well as approach-avoidance behaviors in daily life (assessed using
ecological momentary assessments). Using post-mortem assays, Aim 5 will test the hypothesis that the NOPR
and its interactions with the dopaminergic system is altered in MDD within cortico-striatal-midbrain circuitry.
Contribution to Overall Center Goals and Interactions with Other Center Components. Project 1 will test

10800732,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 2, Project Leader: Dougherty, Massachusetts General Hospital)
The goal of Project 2 is to causally probe the role of cortico-striatal circuits in approach-avoidance conflict using
invasive recording and neurostimulation in awake, behaving humans. Invasive studies in humans serve as a
bridge between the complementary invasive animal and non-invasive human studies in other Projects.
Noninvasive human functional imaging studies provide valuable insights into the circuitry underlying specific
brain functions but – fundamentally – are correlative in nature. Invasive measurements in humans during tasks
provide markedly better spatial resolution (down to the single neuron) and temporal resolution (down to 5-10
milliseconds). More critically, the ability to stimulate using the same electrodes allows for unique “backwards
neuroimaging”. Instead of performing a task and observing which brain networks are involved, one can stimulate
different brain regions at different amplitudes, frequencies and task epochs to observe effects on task
performance all while simultaneously recording. In this project we propose to study approach-avoidance conflict
in two human models: (1) deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) and (2)
surgical epilepsy monitoring. Over five years, we will recruit 20 DBS patients with chronic DBS electrodes in the
VC/VS for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and 20 patients with epilepsy with acute depth electrodes for
seizure monitoring. We will investigate the behavioral and neural effects of DBS on approach-avoidance behavior
in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with implanted DBS electrodes in the VC/VS. Capitalizing on
our prior studies and extensive set of preliminary data we will use an approach/avoidance decision making task
to assess behavioral and neural changes associated with stimulation of the ventral striatum (as opposed to no
stimulation) in neuropsychiatric patients with implanted DBS depth electrodes. We will also investigate the large-
scale neural network of approach-avoidance behavior in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes, and
test the hypothesis that closed-loop stimulation targeting key cortico-striatal nodes will bidirectionally modulate
approach-avoidance behaviors in depressed patients. Building on our extensive experience in this area we will
record simultaneous activity of multiple prefrontal structures and, in some cases, striatum, in patients admitted
to the MGH Epilepsy Monitoring Units following implantation of depth electrodes. To maximize synergies across
Projects, the task will be identical to the one used in Project 1 (with unmedicated individuals with MDD or anxiety
disorders) and functionally analogous to the one in Project 3 (with non-human primates). Contribution to
Overall Center Goals & Interactions with Other Center Components. By testing that direct stimulation of
both approach-related (e.g., striatum) and avoidance-related (e.g., pregenual anterior cingulate cortex) areas
affects approach-avoidance behavior in humans, Project 2 will directly link the non-invasive fMRI studies in
individuals with unmedicated MDD (Project 1) with the non-human primate (Project 3) and rodent (Project 4)
studies that will mechanistically dissect neurobiological mechanisms governing approach/avoidance behaviors."
10800734,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 3, Project Leader: Graybiel, Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
Our goal is to identify neural circuit mechanisms underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety
disorders to advance therapeutic treatments. Project 3’s Aims, coordinated with those of the other Projects, will
capitalize on our findings on the physiology and function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), strongly linked
to MDD and anxiety disorders, and its connections with specialized neurochemical compartments of the striatum
called striosomes. Striosomes are richly interconnected with the neuromodulatory dopamine system, a key site
influencing motivational states and, in dysfunction, neuropsychiatric illness. We developed a non-human primate
(NHP) version of the approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) task used in humans to study anxiety and depression, as well
as rodent models allowing manipulation of the ACC-striatal circuit. We found that manipulation of this circuit can
profoundly bias Ap-Av decisions, increasing avoidance behavior, and such effects can be mimicked by chronic
stress, dose-dependently reversed by anxiolytics in NHPs, and induced by ACC-striosomal circuit manipulations
in rodents. We now propose to determine the influence of nociceptin receptors (NOPR) on this circuit.
Antagonists of NOPR given systemically increase striatal dopamine efflux, and this treatment reduces
depression- and anxiety-related measures in rodent models and has shown initial promising findings in MDD.
Notably, we recently found together with Project 4 that the nociceptin peptide, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ)
is expressed selectively in striosomal neurons, neurons we recently demonstrated project directly to nigral
dopamine neurons. Thus, we hypothesize that NOPR antagonists interrupt striosomal N/OFQ signaling at
dopamine neurons modulating striatal dopamine release and biasing Ap-Av decision-making when individuals
face cost-benefit tradeoffs. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that NOPR antagonists can normalize a shift in Ap-Av
behavior as well as neural striosomal and dopamine signals induced in mice by prior chronic stress. Aim 2 tests
whether NOPR antagonists shift Ap-Av decision boundaries and neural activity by asking whether NOPR
antagonists remain effective in the absence of striosomal N/OFQ, nigral NOPRs or both. Aim 3, importantly, will
coordinately test NOPR effects in NHPs with recordings and microstimulation in the ACC during Ap-Av decisions.
Contribution to Overall Center Goals and Interactions with Other Center Components. These Aims will
provide a fundamental infrastructure for designing approaches to the treatment of MDD and anxiety disorders, a
goal directly related to the other projects and the NIMH mission to understand, prevent and cure mental illness.
We will establish a crucial behavioral bridge connecting mouse, NHP and human behavioral studies, including
widely used mouse behavioral assays of anhedonia and avolition (Project 4), NHP Ap-Av behavior (our Project
3) and human Ap-Av behavior (Projects 1 and 2), in coordination with the Computational Core, to identify
conserved behavioral and neural features across a translational panel of species."
10800737,"Project Summary
The overall goal of Project 4 is to determine how the nociceptin/receptor system modulates the mesolimbic
dopamine (DA) system and behavioral responses associated with stress, aversion, and motivated behaviors.
We recently identified a population of paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTA) nociceptin (PNOC+) neurons
that constrain motivated behavior and regulate the motivation for natural reward seeking. These PNOC+ pnVTA
neurons are engaged during motivation, as well as carry a negative valence when activated. Our extensive body
of preliminary findings strongly implicate these neurons in regulating motivated behaviors, stress responsivity,
and avoidance behavior. Working in close collaboration with the other Projects (in particular, Projects 1 and 3),
Project 4 will use newly developed mouse model for accessing endogenous nociception circuits and focus on
the neurobiological mechanisms of how the prepronociceptin system engages the dopamine system to regulate
motivation – a key component of depressive disorders, including those outlined in this center project. The
research aims of this 5-year project are: (1) to determine the anatomical and functional characteristics of
nociceptin expressing neurons within the ventral midbrain and identify behavioral conditions (acute vs chronic
stress, motivation and Approach-Avoidance) that are modulated by this system; (2) to identify and characterize
pnVTA nociceptin neurons and their afferents involved in motivated behavior that drive negative affective
behavior. The project will use novel and validated mouse cre-driver models that allow unparalleled access to
PNOC+ neurons in the VTA, combined with optogenetic, chemogenetic, calcium imaging, viral tracing, and
behavior to uncover circuit mechanisms that underlie how these neurons are regulated by aversive stimuli. This
project directly synergizes with the other projects outlined in this Conte Center, in two key ways: 1) using novel
cutting-edge mouse models, it will allow to dissect the role of prepronociceptin system in motivation, and 2) it will
comprehensively examine the role of nociceptin circuits in dopamine-dependent behaviors, with direct relevance
to motivational states, avoidance, and stress-induced negative affect. Results from Project 4 will: (1) directly
inform post-mortem analyses probing nociception neurons in the pnVTA of individuals with MDD who died by
suicide (Project 1); (2) synergize with pharmacological challenges used to test the hypothesis that nociceptin
receptor antagonism will normalize neural substrates underlying approach/avoidance behaviors in humans with
MDD and anxiety disorders (Project 1); and (3) integrate with studies using PNOC-IRES-cre mice to determine
how specific populations of nociceptin neurons (striatal vs VTA) regulate motivation, anhedonia, and
approach/avoidance decision making (Project 3). Data emerging from Project 4’s aims, together with the three
other projects and the Computational Modeling Core will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the
nociceptin/NOPR system in motivation and depressive/anxious behaviors, and identify novel treatment targets."
10800741,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Computational Modeling Core, Core Leader: Frank, Brown University)
The overarching goal of the Computational Modeling Core is to provide a common formal framework that can
quantify dynamic decision processes in approach-avoidance conflict across species in Projects 1-4, including
the impact of neural recordings and manipulations. We leverage hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation of
the drift diffusion model (HDDM), which captures not only choice proportions for varying reward, aversion, and
conflict, but also the full response time distributions associated with these choices. HDDM facilitates reliable
estimation of decision parameters and their modulation by trial-by-trial variance in neural signals, and supports
Bayesian hypothesis testing for how these parameters may differ as a function of clinical status, brain state, and
manipulations (e.g., nociceptin antagonism, acute/chronic stress, stimulation). We have shown how such
“computational biomarkers” can provide enhanced sensitivity to discriminate between patient conditions and
symptoms relative to traditional measures of behavior and brain activity. We will leverage neural recordings and
stimulation from frontal cortex and basal ganglia across species to assess whether their variability is
parametrically related to motivated evidence accumulation, and whether these signals are altered with neural
manipulations and in clinical populations. Machine learning methods will quantify the degree to which such
quantitative model fitting improves (1) classification of patient condition and brain state relative to the same
methods applied to the raw behavioral and neural data or their summary statistics, and (2) our ability to map
disease course, including suicidality and symptoms. Building on our extensive experience in neural networks
and levels of computation involved in motivated learning and decision making across species, our computational
framework will facilitate not only enhanced sensitivity to discriminate between clinical conditions, but will also
identify hypotheses about the mechanisms involved, which will be tested via causal manipulations using the
same quantitative framework. For example, our preliminary modeling studies indicate that variability in sub-
populations within pregenual cingulate activity in non-human primates affects motivated evidence accumulation,
and that in humans, the same parameter distinguishes MDD vs. healthy subjects and scales with symptoms.
Moreover, these computational biomarkers are critical for predicting whether any individual is in one clinical state
or another, whereas classification based on behavior and/or brain activity alone is at chance levels. The causal
neural and psychological mechanisms of these effects will be further delineated and greatly expanded by utilizing
the same quantitative framework with causal manipulations and more precise temporal recordings.
Contribution to Overall Center Goals & Interactions with Other Center Components. As the Computational
Modeling Core, our framework applies to approach-avoidance decision making across species and methods,
and will be applied across all Projects. We will benefit from interactions amongst experts with complementary
expertise in systems and cognitive neuroscience, psychiatry, computational modeling, and machine learning."
10800743,"PROJECT SUMMARY - RESOURCE
The Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) at the University of Missouri (MU) provides a unique
repository service by importing, storing and distributing mutant mouse strains, cryopreserved germplasm,
embryonic stem cells and related reagents as well as performing research to continuously improve the use of
mouse models in research. Genetically-engineered mice (GEM, i.e., transgenics, knock-outs and knock-ins)
are invaluable to almost all fields of medicine. Tens of thousands of GEM have been created over the last
three decades to facilitate better understanding of developmental biology and disease and to test and improve
the function of drugs and therapeutics. Since the MMRRC network began, it has evolved into a major resource
for the research community with capabilities and a combined inventory of mouse lines and embryonic stem
(ES) cells that exceeds the capacity of other mouse repositories worldwide. The overall goal of this proposal is
to continue the existing services and expand the functions and capabilities of the MU MMRRC. The specific
aims are to 1) provide biomedical investigators with the mouse models and related reagents they require for
their research, 2) provide value-added services to aid the biomedical research community, and 3) perform
research that has broad application to all models distributed. Over the next five years, the MU MMRRC will
continue to rederive imported mice to a pathogen-free state; cryopreserve gametes and embryos; perform
genetic and infectious disease monitoring to ensure quality; and distribute live mice, cryopreserved germplasm,
tissues, and embryonic stem cells. Research efforts will continue to assess the role of complex gut microbiota
in model phenotypes and model reproducibility and translatability by developing well controlled antigen-
experienced microbiota, economic strategies by which complex microbiota can be transferred, and tools to
better sample microbiota kinetics. These studies will yield new paradigms by which the MMRRC can provide
mice (i.e. harboring one or more standardized complex microbiota) and refine value added services that will be
made available to the biomedical research community. The MU MMRRC will also continue to transition to a
self-sustaining unit by offering an increasing number of services that generate program income. Services
include cryopreservation, cryoresuscitation from embryos or sperm, rederivation, genotyping and assay
development, marker-assisted genetic analysis for development of speed congenics, karyotyping, colony
management, phenotyping, and microbiome manipulation and analysis."

10800747,"Applied Research section 1 – Project Summary
After decades of efforts to rid laboratory mice of pathogens and other subclinical microbes capable of
confounding research, there is an emerging realization that mice completely devoid of any and all viral,
bacterial, protozoal, and fungal pathogens including even the most questionable opportunists, are essentially
antigen-naïve and as such, may not serve as appropriate or ideal models of human disease. Several studies
have demonstrated that pet store and wild mice are qualitatively different from standard laboratory mice in
terms of circulating memory T cell and immunoglobulin profiles. This antigen-experienced immunophenotype
is consistently associated with a protective effect in models of infectious disease, intestinal inflammation, and
tumorigenesis, and this immunophenotype can be transferred experimental via the gut microbiota (GM). In the
interests of biosecurity, worker safety, and reproducible data however, it would be ideal if the antigen-
experienced immunophenotype could be induced in laboratory mice via experimental inoculation with the
appropriate microbes. Thus, the long-term objectives of this Applied Research section are to investigate and
develop methods of reproducibly inducing an antigen-experienced immunophenotype in laboratory mice which
confers a protective effect in disease models previously shown to be sensitive to these factors. The Specific
Aims are to 1) test the ability of two candidate bacterial ‘provocateurs’ of host immune responses, alongside a
viral control and in the context of two distinct GM communities, to induce the differentiation of effector memory
T cells and immunoglobulin production, and 2) to evaluate the susceptibility of mice in these experimental
antigen exposure groups to disease susceptibility using two commonly used mouse models of disease known
to differ in severity depending on the degree of previous host antigen exposure. Specifically, the microbial
agents to be evaluated include Helicobacter hepaticus, segmented filamentous bacteria (Candidatus
Savagella), and Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), and the models to be tested include Non-obese Diabetic (NOD)
mice and DSS-induced colitis. If traditional laboratory mice used in translational biomedical research are
universally more susceptible in disease models as suggested by recent studies, it essentially distorts our ability
to identify mechanisms and therapies of disease, wasting time and resources on ‘false positives’ that do not
translate to humans, and missing opportunities on ‘false negatives’ that show exaggerated toxicities that might
not be present in antigen-experienced individuals. The development and refinement of methods such as those
proposed in this Applied Research section will revolutionize biomedical research and increase efficiencies in
the development of therapeutics and discovery of mechanisms. Moreover, generation and provision of mice
with an antigen-experienced immunophenotype will expand the portfolio of services offered by the MU
MMRRC related to the GM and its influence on mouse models of disease, and increase program income
through novel value-added services applicable to a broad base of investigators."

10800693,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although significant advances have been made in elucidating the structures that regulate fear and food-
seeking responses in isolation, the neural circuits and mechanisms that integrate both behavioral responses
remain poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus
(PVT) is interconnected with areas of the brain implicated in the control of fear and food-seeking responses.
We have recently shown that neurons in the anterior part of PVT (aPVT) respond differently to aversive and
rewarding stimuli, suggesting that this region may be part of a core neural network that integrates fear and
food-seeking responses. Using an experimental approach in which rats need to overcome their fear of
predator cues in order to search for food, in Aim 1 we will identify potential inputs that convey predator threat
and food reward information to aPVT neurons by using a combination of neural tracers, immunohistochemistry,
and electrophysiological recordings in vitro. In Aim 2, we will use optogenetics and single-unit recordings to
manipulate and record from aPVT-projecting neurons during the predator threat vs. food-seeking conflict test.
We will then correlate neural activity with distinct behavioral responses. In Aim 3, we will record from specific
subsets of aPVT neurons while chemogenetically manipulating input regions that transmit threat- and food-
related information to aPVT neurons. The experiments proposed in these three aims will provide insights into
elucidating the competing demands of avoiding threats and approaching rewards, which may have clinical
relevance for understanding adaptive and motivated behaviors."
10797627,"The goal of this project is to integrate analysis of viral and immune responses using white blood
cells, nasal swabs and plasma from 450 children previously collected from the prospective cohort
TEDDY study, to build upon previous TEDDY findings that strongly implicated prolonged
infections with Type B enteroviruses in the development of islet autoimmunity (IA). This will further
determine if prolonged enterovirus infections are linked to development of IA and type 1 diabetes
(T1D), and will provide mechanistic insights into how prolonged infections may trigger disease
outcomes. Specifically, this project will combine two nested case control studies within TEDDY
using stool virome analysis currently underway to find additional instances of children with
prolonged infections, work being carried out by coPIs in this application. In Aim 1 we will complete
the longitudinal disease risk profile of enterovirus infections for all TEDDY children developing IA
or T1D by the age of 6. This will combine analysis of stool, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) and nasal swabs using proven qRT-PCR, ampliseq approaches. The findings will be
used to select PBMC samples from children with confirmed prolonged infection with enterovirus
in Aim 2. These will be subjected to detailed multi-‘omic single cell analysis to define cellular
immune changes associated with prolonged infection and with the subsequent development of
autoimmunity. Aim 3 will analyze plasma samples from a subset of children to determine whether
quantitative or qualitative changes in humoral immunity to enteroviral infection may contribute to
disease outcomes. These aims together investigate, for the first time, the interaction between
virus exposure, resulting cellular and humoral immune changes and subsequent risk of
autoimmunity or T1D. The proposed work is significant as it will apply the power of the large,
international TEDDY cohort and its prospective collection of biosamples (stool, sera and viable
immune cells) to both control for potential confounders and as a source of accessory genetic and
genomic data to inform to determine how prolonged infection with enterovirus is linked to islet
autoimmunity. The proposed work is innovative because it will provide the first comprehensive
and integrated analysis of the virome, immune-cell intrinsic genomic responses and altered
antibody responses as causal drivers of islet autoimmunity and T1D. These findings will lead to a
better understanding of what triggers islet autoimmunity and T1D that will further inform
hypotheses of causal mechanisms and will open conceptual avenues for key diagnostic or
preventative interventions."
10805404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Functional brain development requires the precise coordination of neurochemicals that allow neurons to
form synapses and communicate with one another. Improper synaptic maturation during critical developmental
time windows often lead to cognitive disabilities, such as those observed in autism spectrum disorders, that can
persist into adulthood. Studies in humans and rodents have linked disbalances of serotonin (5-HT) during
prenatal and early postnatal development to increased rates of behavioral and cognitive deficits and irregular
neuronal development. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a region of the brain that plays a key role in processing
higher order cognitive functions that are disrupted when 5-HT levels are altered. During early PFC development,
circuit formation is dependent on the functional maturation and stabilization of excitatory synapses, located on
dendritic spines. Our preliminary studies identified a critical role for 5-HT in the development of dendritic spines
within the PFC, indicating that both spine density and size are directly altered after manipulating 5-HT levels in
early postnatal periods. This proposal is comprised of two aims which seek to test the hypothesis that 5-HT can
potentiate and stabilize dendritic spines at a single synapse level. The first aim uses a combination of techniques
including two-color, two-photon uncaging of 5-HT and glutamate neurotransmitters, electrophysiology,
optogenetics, and pharmacology to determine whether 5-HT can induce functional long-term potentiation of
individual dendritic spines. The second aim is designed to identify whether endogenous 5-HT signaling can
stabilize nascent dendritic spines, which will be investigated by using optogenetics, two-photon 5-HT uncaging
and mechanistic studies that include pharmacological approaches and fluorescence lifetime imaging. Together,
these studies seek to establish the role of 5-HT dependent signaling in synapse maturation and stabilization at
a cellular and molecular level. Results from this project will be essential knowledge towards better mitigating the
cognitive disabilities that result from early 5-HT disbalances in the developing brain."
10805532,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mechanisms underlying evolution of tumor-associated stroma remain poorly understood. In solid tumors
featuring a prominent stromal reaction, an improved understanding of the functions and origins of abundant
stromal cell types may facilitate the development of new and effective therapies. Pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the quintessence of a fibro-inflammatory malignancy, with 50-90% of tumor volume
occupied by a dense, desmoplastic stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the key cell type which
drives the stromal reaction in PDAC, and recent reports suggest that stromal CAFs represent a heterogeneous
population of cells from diverse origins, potentially including cell types which support and others which
suppress tumor growth. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are lipid-storing cells in healthy pancreas which can
transdifferentiate to an activated CAF phenotype. PSCs have been suggested as the predominant source of
fibroblasts in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. However, proper lineage tracing studies have never been
performed, such that the relative contribution and specific functions of PSCs in the tumor microenvironment are
unknown. Here we will take advantage of a novel mouse model we have developed to track PSC
differentiation and function during pancreatic tumor progression in vivo. We hypothesize that PSC-derived
fibroblasts in the PDAC microenvironment are a pro-inflammatory and tumor-supportive subset of PDAC CAFs,
and thus represent a viable therapeutic target. Our preliminary data support the notion that PSCs contribute to
only a subset of the CAF population in the tumor microenvironment, and the functions of these distinct
populations are entirely unknown. Our data to date also highlight a potential role for genetic alterations in the
epithelial compartment in orchestration of stromal fibroblast evolution. PDAC stromal heterogeneity and
functional significance will be interrogated with the following specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the role of PSC-
derived CAFs in pancreatic tumorigenesis. A novel mouse model will be used to ablate PSC-derived CAFs
for the first time and analyze the impact on tumor growth, survival, and organization of the tumor
microenvironment. Aim 2: Assess the consequence of tumor genotype in pancreatic cancer stromal
evolution. Motivated by preliminary data, we will use our reporter mouse model and patient samples to
analyze the interaction between p53 status in tumor cells and stromal CAF evolutionary routes, with important
potential implications for tumor phenotype and therapy responses. Aim 3: Define the role of PSC-derived
CAFs in therapy response and resistance. As PSC-derived CAFs express a transcriptional program
associated with resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, we will determine the effect of these CAFs
on treatment response in vivo. These findings will shed light on mechanisms and consequences of stromal
evolution during pancreatic tumorigenesis, and potentially identify distinct CAF populations of relevance in
additional solid tumors."
10801515,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have become the leading biologic for the long-term
correction of monogenic diseases. Success in numerous clinical trials led in the approval of
currently six AAV-based biologics. However, significant challenges for their wide-spread
utilization remain including pre-existing immunities in large portions of the human population and
toxicities at high doses. Neutralizing antibodies originate from prior exposure to naturally
circulating AAVs that primarily target the capsid leading to vector inactivation and loss of treatment
efficacy. Patients having these antibodies are usually excluded from receiving these therapeutics.
Additionally, other aspects of the immune system pose significant barriers for effective gene
delivery especially following high dose AAV vector administration. These high doses are required
to counteract the low transduction efficiencies of many natural AAV variants to achieve sufficient
transgene expression for therapeutic success. The ability of AAV vectors to deliver their payload
to the target cells is determined by a series of interactions of the capsid to the cell surface
receptors as well as intracellular trafficking factors. Hence, the overall objective of this project is
to characterize these AAV capsids interactions structurally and functionally. Specific questions
our proposal will address are: “How do mAbs from clinical trial participants or donors with natural
AAV exposure bind and neutralize AAV capsids compared to the previously described mouse
mAbs?” (Aim 1) and “How do proteins of the innate immune system, receptors, and other
intracellular factors interact to the AAV capsids?” (Aim 2). We will use cryo-electron microscopy
to determine high-resolution structures of the complexes to ≤3 Å resolution and apply the obtained
information to engineer vectors that retain their cell binding properties but evade recognition by
human antibodies or defensins. Additionally, we will characterize non-primate AAVs and evaluate
their potential as gene delivery vectors (Aim 3). Due to highly diverse capsid amino acid sequence
compared to the commonly utilized AAV serotypes most pre-existing antibodies will be prevented
from binding. Thus, this aim will ask the question: “Can we design new AAV capsids utilizing
structural information from non-primate AAV, while retaining/inserting known receptor-binding
interfaces of the primate AAVs on the capsid surfaces to allow for transduction of human cells
and prevention of antibody neutralization and/or complement activation?” Overall, this project will
culminate in an expanded “pillbox” of engineered vectors with the ability to overcome the
challenges of the host immune responses and efficient gene transfer thereby improving clinical
efficacy and increase the cohort of patients eligible for treatment."
10801596,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), resulting in the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) to neurotoxic levels.
Although there are treatment options, ranging from a strict low-Phe diet to an oral medication (sapropterin, a
cofactor of PAH) to an injectable enzyme substitution therapy (pegvaliase), many PKU patients find it challenging
to adhere to the dietary intervention and have limited responses to or access to the medical therapies and, as a
result, have impaired cognitive development and develop a range of neuropsychiatric problems. Durable and,
ideally, curative therapies are needed to address the unmet medical needs of PKU patients.
More than 1,000 PAH variants have been cataloged in patients. These vary in their consequences for PAH
activity, from having little or no effect to eliminating PAH activity completely. Certain variants occur much more
commonly than others in PKU patients. The most frequently occurring pathogenic PAH variant worldwide is the
R408W (c.1222C>T, p.Arg408Trp) variant. Patients homozygous for this variant do not respond to sapropterin,
limiting their treatment options.
In vivo gene editing is an emerging therapeutic approach to making DNA modifications in the body of a patient,
such as in the liver. Gene-editing tools include nucleases, cytosine base editors, adenine base editors, and prime
editors. CRISPR base editors and prime editors are attractive because they can function efficiently for introducing
precise targeted alterations without the need for double-strand breaks, in contrast to CRISPR-Cas9 and other
gene-editing nucleases. We and others have demonstrated the ability of base editors to make specific DNA edits
with very high efficiency and limited off-target effects in the liver in mouse models and non-human primates.
We now seek to assess whether a one-time delivery of adenine base editing or prime editing can be used to
permanently correct the human PAH R408W variant in human hepatocytes in vitro and in the liver in humanized
mice in vivo efficiently and safely and, if so, the optimal editing system to use for this purpose. Success in
completing this translational project will provide critical information on the feasibility of an in vivo genome-
editing approach that could ultimately yield a one-shot, long-term therapy that permanently corrects the most
frequent PAH pathogenic variant and thus serves as a potential cure for PKU patients with this variant. The
proposed work, if successful, could open the door to a new therapeutic modality for many PKU patients—
not just for patients with the PAH R408W variant, but those with other editable pathogenic variants in the PAH
gene—as well as patients with such variants in other liver-expressed, disease-associated genes."
10801930,"Disrupted sleep is a common and persistent symptom after traumatic brain injury, which can significantly
complicate recovery. Memories are formed and encoded in the hippocampus and then consolidated via replay
during sleep. Consolidated memories are then transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex via synchronous
interaction between cortical sleep spindles and hippocampal sharp-wave ripple oscillations. Therefore, chronic
sleep disturbances may lead to memory dysfunction and induce adverse changes in cognitive performance over
time post-TBI. However, the mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits due to chronic sleep disruption following
traumatic brain injury remain poorly understood.
To improve quality of life in Service Members and Veterans with traumatic brain injury, an understanding of the
varied mechanisms triggered by traumatic brain injury is required to prevent or optimally manage cognitive
recovery over time post brain injury. Therefore, our long-term goal is to uncover fundamental principles of
cognitive deficits following brain trauma. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we demonstrated a significant reduction
in duration and depth of slow wave sleep as well as decrease in sleep spindles detected in the CCI-injured
cortex. Moreover, we also demonstrated significant changes in the hippocampal ripple oscillations, potentially
indicating loss of information encoded in the sharp-wave ripple oscillations post-CCI. These preliminary results,
together with histopathological changes observed in the hippocampus and cortex, have led to our central
hypothesis that TBI-induced sleep disturbances may contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting the
memory reactivation loop between cortex and hippocampus.
The goal of this project is to interrogate chronic sleep disruption using a clinically relevant large animal model of
TBI. Our specific objective for this proposal is to determine a prognostic value of sleep spindles as a biomarker
for cognitive recovery following TBI. Our interdisciplinary team of the electrophysiologists and a trauma
neuropathologist is uniquely poised to address this fundamental question by combining our broad background
in swine in vivo electrophysiology, cognitive behavior, and histopathology. In this way, we will use our unique,
large animal model of CCI injury (swine) along with wireless video EEG monitoring and cognitive behavioral
testing to up to 6 months post-CCI injury to provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying the
persistent cognitive deficits post-TBI.
Our proposal directly addresses the Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Service mission to
restore brain function impaired by injury by pioneering research to maximize Veterans’ physical, psychological,
and social function. Examination of the circuit level changes in a clinically relevant large animal model, in parallel
with neuropathological outcome and cognitive testing, provides a powerful translational approach to
understanding a prognostic value of disrupted sleep as a biomarker for cognitive recovery following brain trauma.
In this way, the outcomes of this study may reveal novel targets for diagnosis, management, intervention, and
treatment of cognitive deficits following TBI, including non-pharmacological treatments such as cognitive
behavioral interventions and neuromodulation."
10932368,"Persistence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is an existential threat to postmitotic cells like neurons, and
persistent accumulation of DSBs is implicated in the pathomechanism(s) of several neurodegenerative diseases,
including Huntington's disease (HD). Furthermore, intact, and active DNA damage repair is required for the
proper development and differentiation of neurons and glia in the central nervous system. HD is caused by the
expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ)-coding CAG repeats in the gene huntingtin (HTT) and DNA damage repair
genes are the major modifiers of HD age-of-onset as reported in recent GWAS studies. We recently showed that
wild-type HTT forms a transcription-coupled DNA single strand-break (TC-SSB) repair complex with RNA
polymerase II, Ataxin-3, and polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), an essential DNA repair enzyme. In
turn, the presence of mutant HTT in brains of HD mouse models and HD patients impairs PNKP activity, resulting
in the persistence of single stranded breaks in transcribed genes. We also demonstrated that the SUMO E3
ligase Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) modulates PNKP activity and genome integrity in HD
transgenic mice and patient iPSC derived neurons. Further, PIAS1 enhances SUMO modification of PNKP,
suggesting that reversible post-translational modification(s) (PTMs) of the DNA repair complex components may
play a significant role in modulating efficacy of DNA repair and disease severity. In a major advance, we
discovered that the native wildtype HTT plays a much broader role than previously characterized in genome
maintenance through its function within a novel transcription-coupled-nonhomologous end-joining (TC-NHEJ)
complex, comprised of well-established NHEJ enzymes including PNKP that repair double strand breaks (DSBs).
This complex facilitates error-free repair of DSBs in neurons. These processes are tightly coupled with regulation
of chromatin remodeling at sites of DNA damage, and we recently found that the chromatin modifier BRG1
(Brahma-related gene 1) is also a component of this NHEJ complex and is dysregulated in HD mouse models.
Based on these studies, we hypothesize that this novel protein complex resolves DSBs during transcription to
maintain genome integrity and the health of neural cells. Our preliminary data show that mutant HTT inhibits
DSB repair by impeding TC-NHEJ activity, resulting in the persistence of DSBs in HD systems. The goal of this
proposed work is to understand the mechanisms by which active TC-NHEJ complex is impaired by the presence
of the CAG repeat expansion, and how SUMOylation and phosphorylation of individual TCR protein components
modulates TCR complex activity in response to DSBs. Further, we propose to evaluate the contribution of PIAS1,
PNKP and BRG1 to DDR outcomes. Aim 1: Identify how mHTT alters the function of the HTT/BRG1/TC-NHEJ
complex. Aim 2: Determine the functional consequences of mHTT disruption of the TC-NHEJ and BRG1
chromatin remodeling complexes on DNA damage responses. Aim 3: Determine the impact of modulating the
HTT/BRG1/PIAS1/TC-NHEJ complex on the complex activity in the presence of mHTT."
10789742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The thymus, which is the primary site of T cell generation, is extremely sensitive to injury; but also has a
remarkable capacity for endogenous repair. However, even though there is continual thymic involution and
regeneration in response to everyday insults like stress and infection, profound thymic damage caused by
common cancer therapies and the conditioning regimes for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) lead to
prolonged T cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, in the context of allogeneic HCT, the thymus is an extremely
sensitive target to alloreactive T cells during graft versus host disease (GVHD). Consequently, identification of
therapies that can boost T cell reconstitution in recipients of HSCT is a clinical priority.
 We have previously identified two distinct pathways of endogenous thymic regeneration, centered on the
production of the regeneration factors IL-22 by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and BMP4 by endothelial cells (ECs);
both of which mediate their regenerative effects by targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs). More recently we
have found that the trigger for these distinct regenerative pathways hinge on the balance between forms of cell
death, with immunologically silent apoptosis (which is abundant in thymocytes during steady-state) suppressive
to the regenerative program. On the other hand, after thymic damage caused by radiation injury, we found a
switch toward immunogenic cell death, with the resulting release of damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) sufficient to promote regeneration. Specifically, we identified that intracellular Zn was released after
radiation injury, where it could signal through the G-protein coupled receptor 39 (GPR39) to stimulate production
of BMP4 and IL-23, a key upstream regulator of IL-22 production. Separately, we also found that the release of
the prototypical DAMP, ATP, was able to signal directly on thymic epithelial cells through purinergic (P2)
receptors and promote their expression of Foxn1, key microenvironmental drivers of T cell development.
Importantly, our preliminary data also suggests that each of these pathways can be therapeutically targeted to
improve thymic recovery in mouse models of HCT. Our preliminary data has also identified putative TEC
precursors that are important for regenerating the epithelial compartment and thus promoting regeneration, as
well as the emergence with age of aberrant epithelial cells that limit thymic function, including in its reparative
capacity after acute damage. Our research program is thus exploring several key questions: What are the
triggers and upstream regulators of endogenous tissue regeneration in the thymus? Which cells mediate tissue
regeneration in the thymus after acute injury? Are there limitations to endogenous regeneration after HCT across
sex and lifespan? Can we exploit these mechanisms of endogenous regeneration to develop therapeutic
strategies to boost T cell reconstitution in HCT recipients?
 The studies outlined in this proposal not only have the potential to define important pathways underlying
tissue regeneration but could also result in innovative clinical approaches to enhance thymic function."
10934491,"Project Summary
There is growing policy activity among states and counties to use non-federal funds to offer health care
coverage to low-income, uninsured undocumented immigrants. However, there is only limited evidence on
undocumented immigrants’ health care utilization in the context of expanded access to care to support these
policies and guide their implementation. This R21 project will investigate one long-standing local program to
build the evidence base on how expanded access to care affects undocumented immigrants’ patient outcomes
and health care utilization. We will focus on patients enrolled in MyHealth LA (MHLA), the oldest and largest
local health plan for undocumented immigrants, located in Los Angeles County. MHLA provides a primary care
home at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and specialty, inpatient, and ED care through the county
health system for ~130,000 patients annually. This project will determine the impact of programs that expand
health care access to uninsured, low-income undocumented immigrants and understand how these patients
utilize care over time. Aim 1 of our project will use a unique data source of merged patient records, Medi-Cal
claims, and enrollment records from hospital encounters to determine whether MHLA patients have better (1)
ED and (2) inpatient outcomes than a matched sample of undocumented patients who are not enrolled in
MHLA (ED encounters>140,000 , inpatient encounters>46,000) between 2016-2022. This aim will provide
evidence on the impact of expanded access to care on patient outcomes by comparing enrolled and non-
enrolled patients. Aim 2 will look within the entire enrolled MHLA population to understand utilization over time.
We will merge MHLA enrollment records with Medi-Cal claims data from 2015-2022 to construct individual-
level panel data (n>90,000) to examine (1) ED, (2) outpatient specialty, (3) primary care, (4) hospitalized
inpatient, (5) preventive care, and (6) prescription utilization patterns 24 months after enrollment. We will
identify differences in utilization by important demographic characteristics (e.g race/ethnicity, age, language,
chronic conditions). This information can be used to distinguish subgroups with high utilization, set program
standards, and anticipate utilization patterns over time. We will also examine whether clinic characteristics and
external events (ie, COVID-19 pandemic) correlate with utilization patterns. The result of this study can be
used to help support the development of local and state-level policies that expand access to care for
undocumented residents as well as help policy makers, clinicians, and researchers anticipate outcomes after
these policies are implemented. We will work with a Steering Committee of FQHC leadership, MHLA
leadership, and community advocates to interpret and disseminate our findings."
10798125,"The cerebellum, consisting of 80% of the neurons in the human brain, is involved in balance and motor
coordination, and also modulates language, reasoning and social processes via its forebrain circuits. The
developing cerebellum is particularly sensitive to factors that impact on growth (or cause injury) around birth,
since much of its growth occurs in the third trimester and continues after birth. The postnatal cerebellar cortex
has two proliferating stem/progenitor populations, one dedicated to making excitatory granule cells and the
other to interneurons and astrocytes. Whereas great advances have been made in defining the
stem/progenitor cells and lineages that generate the developing cerebellum, little is known about the ability of
the cerebellum to produce new cells following injury. We recently discovered that the mouse cerebellum has a
large capacity to replenish cells killed around birth. First, we found that Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs)
that normally are dedicated to the astrocyte lineage are reprogrammed to become granule cell precursors
(GCPs) when the latter are killed by irradiation or genetic approaches. Furthermore, at least two spatially and
transcriptionally distinct NEP subtypes that are lineage-restricted have different responses to the loss of GCPs
to achieve proper scaling of cell types after injury. Second, Purkinje cells (PCs), which are born by embryonic
day 13.5, are rapidly replaced via proliferation of rare immature Purkinje cells (iPCs) following PC killing, and
replenishment of PCs is age-dependent. Finally, signals released by dying cells, such as reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and cells in the microenvironment can have critical influences on repair responses of
progenitor cells. Preliminary results showed that cells in microenvironment have distinct cellular responses in
each of our injury models. We will address two critical questions for both injuries: i) What are the gene
expression changes that underlie the cellular transitions necessary for cell replenishment and ii) what are the
roles of dying cells, immune cells and glia in regeneration. Our central hypothesis is that cerebellar progenitors
and rare immature neurons maintain distinct transcriptional plasticity and along with cells in the
microenvironment respond differently to killing of GCPs and PCs. Our specific aims are to: 1) Uncover the
transcriptional signatures of NEP subtypes and iPCs during development and regeneration, and identify
pathways required for proliferation and neuron production using single cell and mutant analyses. 2) Determine
how the microenvironment influences NEP and iPC injury responses."

This application seeks support for four highly qualified predoctoral candidates committed to innovative
research careers in the area of obesity, metabolic disorders and nutrition. Our training program brings together
two well-established PhD programs at Tufts University, the Biochemical & Molecular Nutrition (BMN) Program
at the Gerald J and Dorothy R Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and the Cell, Molecular &
Developmental Biology (CMDB) Program at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Both
programs reside on Tufts’ Health Sciences Campus and each will contribute strong support through
infrastructure for graduate admissions, student services, registration and tracking of academic progress and
importantly, financial support for students. Students who have been admitted to the BMN or CMDB PhD
programs, completed their first year of training with distinction, joined one of the training program faculty’s
laboratory groups, selected a thesis topic within the scope of the training program, and stated their intent to
pursue a career as a research scientists will be eligible for appointment to the training program. A Steering
Committee will advise the training program’s leadership on program operations. They will review candidates for
appointment and reappointment, assess the alignment of thesis projects with the training program’s goals, and
evaluating trainee progress based on a written Thesis Advisory Committee report. The program faculty have
been selected based on their research activities and track record or their potential as mentors. Of note, the
training program faculty have a strong collaborative record of research funding and publication. We will prepare
PhD students to become independent research scientists through thesis research and didactic and experiential
learning. Trainees will be enrolled in either of two schools and their programs share a similar philosophy and
sequence. Both cohorts of trainees will have access to the same career development and skill building
activities, will interact through shared seminars, journal clubs and student research presentations, take some
courses together and benefit from the programs and resources of the NIDDK-funded Boston Nutrition Obesity
Research Center. Indeed, our trainees will have a broader exposure to scientific ideas and approaches than
those in traditional programs at either school. By design, this training plan will serve to foster cohesion among
program trainees and help them learn to work in a multi-disciplinary environment. Program components include
didactic coursework, seminar-bases courses, a qualifying examination, research rotations, thesis research, and
career development planning. The training program is designed to be truly multi-disciplinary in approach and to
provide a broad range of training opportunities with the ultimate goal of preparing trainees for successful
careers as research scientists."
10798215,"Surgical resection is the initial treatment for nearly all brain tumors and the extent of resection is strongly correlated with
prognosis. However, because brain tumors, especially gliomas, are intimately involved in surrounding functioning brain
tissue, aggressive resection must be balanced against the risk of causing new neurological deficits. Modern advances in
anatomical and functional imaging and the widespread adoption of neuro-navigation now help neurosurgeons to plan and
execute an optimal surgical approach. Unfortunately, changes in the shape of the brain during surgery, known as brain
shift, invalidate the assumption of all commercial neuro-navigation systems that preoperative data can be mapped to
patient coordinates using rigid registration. Because brain shift progresses during surgery, the rigid registration of neuro-
navigation systems is least accurate at the critical final stages of resection when the marginal tissue is being removed.
There has been more than 20 years of research invested in measuring, modeling and compensating for brain shift with
the goal of providing neuro-navigation systems with an accurate nonrigid registration from preoperative image data to
the patient’s brain in the presence of brain shift. While results are promising, they are not yet accurate enough to be
incorporated into commercial systems. Nonrigid registration is subject to both measurement and modeling uncertainty
that varies throughout 3D space. Most nonrigid registration methods do not attempt to quantify this uncertainty and, to
our knowledge, there have been no attempts to present this uncertainty to the surgeon. We believe that it is important
to make surgeons aware of this uncertainty so that they can make informed decisions, particularly in locations where
uncertainty is high. In this project, we plan to investigate nonrigid registration algorithms that model registration
uncertainty explicitly, semi-automatic and fully-automatic nonrigid registration methods that utilize registration
uncertainty to iteratively guide registration improvements, and visualization paradigms for effective presentation of
registration uncertainty to surgeons in the surgical environment.
We hypothesize that effective representation and visualization of registration uncertainty for brain shift correction in
neuro-navigation will 1) lead to iterative semi-automatic and fully-automatic nonrigid registration methods that improve
registration accuracy and 2) allow neurosurgeons to make more informed decisions during tumor resections that will lead
to increased clinical impact of image-guided neurosurgery. We will carry out the following Aims: 1. Develop novel feature-
based image registration algorithms that represent uncertainty explicitly; 2. Use registration uncertainty maps to guide
semi- and fully-automatic nonrigid registration; 3. Evaluate the utility of nonrigid registration with uncertainty visualization
in a clinical setting."
10798217,"U-RISE SUMMARY
The new Cal State LA U-RISE program is designed to build on our 50 years of experience in
preparing undergraduate scientists for PhD-level careers in biomedical research. Historically
centered in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Biological Sciences within the
College of Natural and Social Sciences, biomedical research training program has expanded to
include faculty and students from two additional colleges and eight more departments on our
campus. In total, we will be able to choose student participants from over 4600 eligible
undergraduates, who create one of the most diverse campuses in the nation. In the past five
years, 77% of Cal State LA undergraduates that participated in our RISE or MARC training
programs enrolled in PhD programs throughout our country.
The U-RISE program is designed to develop student technical, operational, and professional
skills. This is done in a way that intentionally creates a sustainable infrastructure for inclusive
research training at Cal State LA. U-RISE trainees will participate in year-long, authentic
research experiences on and off campus, weekly scientific seminars, and scientific conferences.
They will learn how to conduct research responsibly and ethically, present their research
findings professionally, and create successful PhD program applications. Innovations in the new
U-RISE proposal include the development of new elective research training courses open to all
Cal State LA students. These courses will broaden participation in research by allowing
students to explore scientific research while earning credit towards their degree programs. We
believe these innovations will help spread the culture of research from our U-RISE program to
other parts of the campus.
U-RISE trainees will build their own scientific identities while making a difference in communities
that matter to them. They will experience expanded opportunities for research training
experiences with investigators trained in the best practices of mentoring for inclusivity. The
grant will serve 20-35 students annually, and includes over 40 participating faculty in ten
departments within the Colleges of Natural and Social Sciences, Health and Human Services
and Engineering, Computer Science and Technology. Following completion of the program, at
least 85% of our U-RISE trainees will successfully enroll in PhD programs. At least 80% of U-
RISE alumni in PhD programs will successfully complete these. These students will join the 63
Cal State LA students from NIH supported research training programs that have completed or
are currently enrolled in PhD programs in the past 15-years."
10812390,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal is aimed at developing immune cell engineering approaches for the monitoring and treatment of
T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as Type-I diabetes (T1D). The native 5-module receptor
complexes that drive T cell responses to peptide antigens embedded in MHC molecules have evolved through
an iterative process over the last ~435 million years to optimize T cell responses to a broad range of
challenges. Using a biomimetic approach, we have developed a 5-module chimeric antigen receptor (5MCAR)
and reported that cytotoxic T cells expressing 5MCARs (5MCAR-CTLs) can specifically target and kill
autoimmune CD4+ T cells that mediate T1D in preclinical mouse models, resulting in significantly reduced
disease incidence in 5MCAR-CTL-treated mice. Our proof-of-concept work supports the idea, echoed by the
RFA to which we are responding, that engineered immune cell-based immunotherapies hold promise for the
treatment of autoimmune diseases. Also as noted in the RFA, this area of investigation is in its infancy and
requires support of exploratory engineering approaches to reach its full potential. Our foundational work
provides us with a novel platform from which to continue the development of novel biomimetic engineering
approaches for detecting and eliminating autoimmune T cell responses. Our goals here will be to develop
novel applications using our 1st generation 5MCAR technology and to iterate on the 5MCAR platform through the
engineering and testing of 2nd generation 5MCARs. Specifically, we will: 1) determine if using 5MCARs to redirect
central memory CD8+ T cells, stem cell memory CD8+ T cells, or Tregs are most effective at preventing T1D in
preclinical models; 2) use 5MCAR-CTLs as sentinels that can trafficking throughout the body and report on the
presence of pathogenic autoimmune CD4+ T cells prior to clinical symptoms; and, 3) engineer and test 2nd
generation 5MCARs that more closely mimic their native counterparts with the goal of improving 5MCAR
performance. When completed, the proposed work will provide valuable pre-clinical data for the therapeutic
potential of biomimetic 5MCAR-CTLs and 5MCAR-Tregs that are engineered based on evolution’s blueprint."
10812392,"Project Summary
Although induction of antigen-specific tolerance by means of targeting such antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) has
been reported in multiple pre-clinical studies, there are currently no effective approaches using DCs in the clinic
to prevent or reverse autoimmunity. DCs have been proven to intrinsically possess the ability to restore and
maintain immune tolerance, making them very attractive candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases.
However, only non-activated DCs (which inherently possess a tolerogenic/suppressive phenotype) can induce
tolerance, whereas activated DCs can trigger immunity. Notably, there is no strategy able to deliver antigen
uniquely to non-activated DCs. To overcome this limitation, the long-term goal of this proposal is to engineer
DCs to guarantee presentation of islet-derived antigen solely by tolerogenic subsets to treat Type 1 Diabetes
(T1D). The central hypothesis is that by ensuring that islet-derived antigen is presented exclusively by tolerogenic
DCs, these DCs will lead to elimination of islet-specific auto-reactive T cells and induction of protective Tregs.
The overarching goal of this proposal will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) Engineering
DCs to express islet-derived antigen using circuits that limit expression to pro-tolerogenic DCs and (2)
Engineering DCs to artificially enforce a pro-tolerogenic irreversible phenotype while also driving expression of
islet-derived antigen. For Aim 1, constructs containing a new promoter driving expression to tolerogenic DCs in
combination with microRNA-based circuits that prevent antigen expression in response to inflammation will be
tested for induction of tolerance. For Aim 2, a transcription factor that can enforce DCs into a highly pro-
tolerogenic state will be used in a construct encoding islet-derived antigen to engineer DCs in T1D mouse
models. This transcriptional regulator was identified in intra-tumor DCs, and its enforced activation was found to
shape DCs into an immune suppressive state that could not be reverted even in response to strong inflammatory
stimuli. The proposed research is innovative because it attempts for the first time to engineer DCs to ensure
presentation of islet-derived antigen only by pro-tolerogenic cells. The significance of this proposal is that, if
successful, it will have identified a strategy to safely engineer DCs for induction of tolerance and will provide a
strong scientific framework for further investigations to engineer these critical orchestrators of the immune
system. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work has the potential to lay the ground for innovative
engineering-based therapies to stop autoimmunity in T1D, which constitutes an essential step to achieve a cure."

Research (STAR) program to provide underrepresented and disadvantaged undergraduate students with two
10-wk summer sessions of research and career development training to enhance their potential to apply for
and complete graduate degrees in biomedical/behavioral science related to cardiovascular (CV), lung, and
blood diseases. Our aim is to increase diversity in individuals who choose careers in biomedical/behavioral
research to reduce morbidity and mortality from CV, lung, and blood diseases. Specific objectives are to: (1)
Increase knowledge of landmark research on the causes and prevention of CV, lung, and blood diseases, (2)
Enhance research skills and experience necessary to be competitive graduate school applicants in CV, lung,
and blood disease research areas, (3) Enhance awareness of the process, practice, and ethics of scientific
research, (4) Prepare Trainees for graduate school and a research career, and (5) Provide quality mentoring.
The program extends over 2 consecutive summers, with distinct activities for each summer. Applicants are
recruited locally and nationally through the Big Ten Academic Alliance Summer Research Opportunity Program
website, mailings, listservs, our website, visits to other campuses, and faculty networks. An Admissions
Committee selects Trainees and matches them with Mentors. Trainees are provided with housing and are
remunerated for their work, which is primarily focused on research closely integrated with that of their Mentor.
Research comprises ~80% of the Trainees’ time, with 20% spent in ethics, research-related, and career
development training. The 18 Mentors are UM faculty with research programs in content areas that are highly
relevant to NHLBI; they have an average of $446,000/yr/Mentor in research funding. The mix of expertise
ranges from laboratory-based bench research to applied community-based and community participatory
research. In addition to direct research experience, Trainees meet weekly to discuss research activities, to set
weekly goals, meet with various academic professionals for dynamic exchanges about graduate school issues,
and discuss classic research articles relevant to CV, lung, and blood diseases. Weekly sessions on either
Ethics- (1st Yr Trainees) or Research-Related (2nd Yr Trainees) Training are included. A 2nd Yr/1st Yr
mentor/mentee program also enhances Trainee retention over two summers. Trainees present their research
in oral and poster formats at the end of the summer session. Scientific, social, and cultural activities in the
Washington, DC area also are included. Extensive program evaluation assesses how well the program
achieves pre-determined Benchmarks and Internal and External Advisory Boards meet to review outcome data
and make recommendations to improve and maintain program quality. We met virtually all of our original
Benchmarks in the first 5 and 10 yrs of our funding and made a number of critical changes to improve the

10811068,"Project summary/Abstract
Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive functions. Current methods
to study neuroinflammation in animal models are extremely limited, primarily restricted to endpoint histological
analysis. Furthermore, a means to precisely control the neuroinflammatory response is lacking.
The goal of this proposal is to develop the first family of biosensors that can be used to report and dynamically
regulate changes in inflammation within the brains of live animals. This is accomplished by a synthetic gene
circuit where a sensor of dynamic changes in inflammatory cytokines translates these changes into production
of proteins capable of mitigating pathological inflammation. Building on our experience with bioluminescent
optogenetics tools, we will develop a light emitting Bioluminescent Kinase Sensor (BlinKS) that activates a light
sensing transcription factor driving cytokines to reduce inflammation. Our first aim is to develop and optimize
sensors based on split luciferases that will produce light in the presence of a molecule produced in the
inflammatory signaling cascade. Inflammation dependent light production is then leveraged to activate light
sensitive optogenetic proteins to control cellular activity. Our second aim is to utilize these light emitting sensors
of the inflammatory cascade in a genetic circuit to control the expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine to
control inflammation as a self-regulating therapeutic in a transgenic mouse model of neuroinflammation. Our end
goal is to apply these inflammation modulators to various animal models where neuroinflammation is a key
pathologic hallmark such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. We expect
these modulators to have high translational potential to combat neurodegeneration and other inflammatory
disorders.
This project is enabled by a multidisciplinary team of five labs with expertise in high throughput screening
methodologies for biosensor engineering, optogenetics, genetic circuits, high throughput single-cell sequencing
and gene expression analysis, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and in vivo applications. We anticipate
that these new biosensors and modulators will be transformative tools for both neuroscience and immunology
research and be a powerful therapeutic by enabling noninvasive imaging of inflammatory responses and
selective, inflammation-dependent immunomodulation with cell type specificity that can be used in deep brain
structures, across large areas, in behaving animals."
10785047,"Abstract
The overall vision is to achieve a detailed understanding of mechanisms that regulate the blood clotting
system, with a special goal of identifying the aspects of the clotting machinery that function differentially in
hemostasis versus thrombosis. The conceptual framework is that human thrombotic diseases result from an
otherwise protective mechanism (immunothrombosis) gone awry. In this view, hemostasis following vascular
injury is driven by the prompt exposure of blood to preexisting, natural procoagulants such as tissue factor and
collagen that are ubiquitous throughout the body and that induce rapid formation of hemostatic plugs. On the
other hand, immunothrombosis is likely triggered and/or greatly enhanced by the elaboration of damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs). An important
concept is that many of these PAMPs and DAMPs that drive immunothrombosis are potential therapeutic
targets with little or no involvement in normal hemostasis. In order to achieve this vision, we need to have a
much better mechanistic understanding of what regulates blood clotting reactions, and in particular we need to
identify and understand the DAMPs that drive thrombosis and coagulopathies. Work initiated in our laboratory
in the mid-2000s was the first to identify inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) as a DAMP and PAMP with potent
prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects, a finding which opened up a new area of investigation in the field of
hemostasis and thrombosis. The proposed work in this grant will focus on three general areas within the
general conceptual framework outlined above: elucidating mechanisms by which procoagulant anionic
polymers such as polyP and nucleic acids regulate blood clotting, inflammation and fibrosis; identifying key
structural details that control the function of the tissue factor/factor VIIa complex; and achieving a detailed
understanding of how phospholipid bilayers regulate blood clotting reactions. These studies will build on our
prior success in this area and will further advance the field."

accumulating evidence suggests that HMTase activity of EZH2, which is executed by the C-terminal
catalytic SET domain, may not represent an ideal target for anticancer drugs in certain situations. First,
multiple genetic studies suggest that the HMTase activity of EZH2 plays a tumor suppressive role in some types
of cancer. Second, EZH2 may promote tumorigenesis and cancer progression independent of its HMTase
competence. These scientific discoveries explain why some cancer cells that require EZH2 for their tumorgenicity
are insensitive to current EZH2 inhibitors and why secondary malignances were sometimes noted in patients
receiving tazemetostat, the first FDA-approved HMTase inhibitor of EZH2. All these clinical failures warrant the
development of new EZH2 inhibitors blocking the HMTase-independent oncogenic function of EZH2,
which may exhibit stronger antitumor potency, fewer side effects and wider clinical applications.
 Recently, an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) was found to mediate the tumor-promoting effect of
EZH2 via gene activation instead of the HMTase activity. In ERa- breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that
malignant phenotypes such as proliferation and migration were unaffected upon tazemetostat treatment or
overexpression of the SET domain-deleted EZH2 but dramatically hindered when the TAD domain was truncated
or when the critical residues for the proper protein folding of the TAD domain were mutated. More importantly, a
group of genes that are essential for tumor migration was specifically activated by the functional TAD domain,
but not regulated by the SET domain. All these results suggest that this particular N-terminal TAD domain, rather
than the methyltransferase activity that current EZH2 inhibitors block, is required for the oncogenic function of
EZH2 in ERa- breast cancer cells. Based on these findings, we carried out a high-throughput screening for
chemicals that specifically interact with this TAD domain and a candidate compound was thus identified. The
lead compound directly binds to the TAD domain of EZH2, downregulates genes that promote cancer
cell migration and abrogates the aggressive phenotypes of ERa- breast cancer cells without interfering
with the methyltransferase activity of EZH2. Computer-aided structural analysis suggests that the critical
residues essential for the structure and functionality of the TAD domain may directly interact with this
prototype compound. Based on these preliminary data, we aim to develop a new class of EZH2 inhibitors
that target the N-terminal TAD domain and to further characterize their chemical and biological features
in the proposed study. Under the instructions of Co-Investigator Dr. Daohong Zhou and Collaborator Dr. Yaxia
Yuan, we will study the structure-activity relationship of our lead compound and further build its binding mode
with the TAD domain. We will also work with Consultant Dr. Stanton McHardy to design and synthesize the
analogs of the prototype compound. Finally, we will carry out the pharmacokinetics studies of the new EZH2
inhibitors with the assistance of Consultant Dr. Nicholas Clanton, evaluate their efficacy and elucidate the
mechanism of action of these compounds in ERa- breast cancer cells as well as in xenograft mouse models of
breast cancer in vivo by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and proteomics analyses, which will be performed by Collaborator
Dr. Zhao Zhang.
 Altogether, this study will yield first-in-class anticancer agents that target a different functional domain of
EZH2 to inhibit its oncogenic function in certain types of cancer cells that do not respond to current EZH2-
targeting drugs."

Wilson disease (WD) is a potentially fatal metabolic disorder caused by genetic mutations in the copper (Cu)
transporter ATP7B and Cu accumulation in tissues. Despite significant progress in identification of disease-
causing mutations, WD remains challenging to diagnose and treat. Using new experimental models and
protocols, this project will develop a comprehensive model of WD pathogenesis and identify new targets for
treatment. Specific Aim 1 will generate an integrated picture of multi-cellular Atp7b-/- liver response to Cu
overload in WD using single cell sequencing data, immunostaining, and qPCR studies. The role of
metallothioneins in disease onset and progression will be examined, and sex-specific differences in metabolic
status of the WD liver will be characterized. The results will be used to identify unique characteristics of hepatic
WD when compared to phenotypically overlapping liver diseases. In Specific Aim 2, the new mouse strain,
Atp7bMac, with Atp7b deleted in cells of myeloid origin, will be characterized and further employed to
determine the role of Atp7b in functional maturation of neutrophils. The functional consequences of Atp7b
loss in myeloid cells will be determined following LPS injection and evaluation of immune response. Specific
Aim 3 will elucidate the liver-gut interaction in WD. By using in situ secretory protein labeling via ER-anchored
TurboID, we will compare liver secretomes of control, Atp7bMac mice and mice with a targeted deletion of
Atp7b in hepatocytes (Atp7bHep mice) to determine how liver signaling is altered by Cu misbalance in the gut
and in NPLC."
10801400,"Alcoholic hepatitis, characterized by liver inflammation and hepatocyte injury, occurs in 10-20% of patients with
alcohol use disorder and accounts for significant mortality and financial burden to the VA healthcare system.
Currently, there is no FDA-approved therapy for such patients and treatment options remain as it was 40 years
ago. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new therapeutic strategies for which a better understanding of the
disease progression is required. There is robust evidence that gut microbial-derived components, such as
endotoxins, are the necessary cofactors for development of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and their
increased serum levels correlate with disease severity. Further studies have demonstrated that elevated
serum levels of the gut luminal antigens occur through two main mechanisms: (i) compromised gut epithelial
barrier integrity that allows for increased paracellular translocation; and (ii) qualitative and quantitative changes
in the gut microbiota associated with an increased production of pathogenic antigens. These antigens normally
penetrate the intestinal epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated barrier integrity. The barrier is
mainly provided by the highly specialized intercellular multiprotein junctional complex, tight junctions (TJ),
located at the apical end of epithelial cells. Several studies have documented that ethanol disrupts the
structural integrity of TJ. The consequent loss of mucosal barrier allows for increased paracellular
translocation of gut luminal pathogenic molecules to travel through portal circulation and initiate a
necroinflammatory cascade in the liver. However, the molecular mechanism by which ethanol compromises TJ
integrity is incompletely understood.
We have previously shown that ethanol consumption alters the methionine metabolic pathway in the liver. The
consequent decline in the methylation index impairs crucial methylation reactions, leading to the generation of
many hallmark features of early alcohol-associated liver injury. We now present novel evidence that ethanol
administration alters the intestinal methionine metabolic pathway and lowers the methylation index in a manner
analogous to the liver. Further compelling evidence demonstrates that the consequent reduction in the
intestinal methylation reactions causes TJ disruption to promote paracellular leakage, endotoxemia and
progressive liver injury. Furthermore, associated with the alcohol-induced disruption of the gut barrier integrity
is gut microbial dysbiosis, marked by an increase in the Proteobacteria phylum and Gram-negative bacteria
that contribute to endotoxemia. More importantly, we show that co-treatment with betaine, a safe, bioavailable,
highly soluble, and naturally occurring methyl group donor, preserves intestinal barrier function and prevents
pathogenic gut microbiome changes to mitigate alcohol-induced endotoxemia and liver inflammation.
Based on these considerations, we put forth the hypothesis that alcohol-induced alteration in the intestinal
methionine metabolic pathway contributes to the disruption of the tight junctions. We further
hypothesize that betaine can prevent ethanol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability and dysbiosis to
prevent/attenuate ALD.
The specific aims to test this hypothesis are:
 1) Gain mechanistic insights into the role and consequences of alterations in the intestinal methionine
 metabolic pathway in disrupting the barrier integrity and function
 2) Investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on alcohol-induced gastrointestinal epithelial
 hyperpermeability, microbial dysbiosis and liver pathophysiology
Successful completion of these studies will provide a mechanistic understanding of the methylation-dependent
regulation of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiome, and identify these sites as new therapeutic
target(s) of betaine for preventing and treating ALD."
10801891,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Built environment approaches make it safer and easier for people across the life span to walk, bicycle, or
wheelchair roll, and mitigate barriers to physical activity by making the healthy choice the default choice. The
National Cooperative Extension system—which serves every state and territory by bringing land-grant
university resources to community members—is poised to implement built environment approaches. However,
barriers exist, and relevant implementation strategies are needed to improve adoption rates. There is a dearth
of research on implementation strategies (methods or techniques to improve uptake of evidence-based
interventions) for community settings, and little is known about effective strategies for integration of built
environment approaches. There is a critical need to develop and test evidence-based, community-driven
implementation strategies to build practice-level capacity to select, adapt, and implement built environment
approaches to address locally identified needs. With this support, Extension can integrate built environment
approaches into their work and improve the health of the millions of Americans they serve. The long-term goal
of this work is to establish an evidence base of tested implementation strategies to bridge research to practice
in Extension and ultimately improve population physical activity levels, thereby reducing cancer risk. Montana
has been selected for initial pilot testing due to a strong collaborative history and presence of an integrated
research-practice partnership (IRPP). The overall goal of this proposed project is to establish implementation
strategies to increase the uptake of built environment approaches in Montana. The rationale that underlies the
proposed research is that without community-driven, tailored implementation strategies, community
organizations will continue to struggle with implementing built environment approaches. The specific aims are
to 1) systematically select and tailor implementation strategies to increase the uptake of built environment
approaches in Extension and 2) pilot test the tailored implementation strategies through an iterative, mixed-
methods approach. The first aim will employ an IRPP process to engage Extension professionals in selecting
and tailoring implementation strategies through a series of collaborative decision-making sessions. The second
aim will use the expanded RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework
(integrating the Implementation Outcomes Framework) to assess 1) acceptability, appropriateness, and
feasibility of built environment approaches (predictors of adoption), 2) Extension Agents’ adoption of built
environment approaches (primary outcome), and 3) acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, reach, and cost
of implementation strategies to guide final revisions. The research proposed in this application is innovative
because it incorporates key community partners to tailor and test implementation strategies rather than
providing top-down strategies that do not address contextual factors. This work is significant as a first step to
begin compiling evidence-based, community-driven implementation strategies to address relevant barriers."

As biological scientists and even as members of an educated society, we all have some familiarity with the
fundamental concept that some aspects of our health are influenced by the set of genes we obtained from our
parents. We are also increasingly aware that our body surfaces, from our skin to our intestine, harbor microbial
strains that also influence our health. Given recent discoveries that many of our microbes are stably colonized
for decades and are acquired in early life, it is perhaps unsurprising that some proportion of the microbes
inside you right now were likely acquired from your parents and/or siblings when you were a child and
maintained in your intestine to this day, potentially influencing your health for these past many years. In
addition, we rarely find commensal gut microbial strains shared between two unrelated individuals outside of
extreme circumstances of microbial transfer such as fecal microbiota transplantation. Given the extreme
uniqueness of microbial strains at the genome level and the rarity of each strain variant, fecal microbiota
transplantation and familial-shared microbes represent the most efficient route to accurately track and infer
basic principles of microbial transmission and sharing. We feel this grant renewal will continue to address
important gaps in our basic science knowledge of gut microbiota transmission. Just as tracking of classical
acute pathogenic microbes plays a key role in disease prevention and treatment, uncovering the basic
principles of microbial sharing and transmission for non-acute pathogen microbes could enable new tools to
quantify disease risk, to understand the importance of the familial microbial strain sharing in disease risk, to
manipulate the gut microbiota to improve health, and ultimately perhaps to enable the prevention of disease
through controlled monitoring or therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota to minimize disease risk."

 Liquid biopsies have made significant strides in cancer medicine, with applications spanning early cancer
detection, assessment of therapy effectiveness and drug-resistance, monitoring tumor-dynamics and early
detection of minimal residual disease, MRD. Yet, substantial questions remain, prohibiting translation to clinical
practice on many occasions. For instance, the inability to detect tumor-circulating DNA (ctDNA) in a fraction of
gliomas, gastric and renal cancers, even for advanced stages, has led to the notion that some tumors are ‘non-
shedders’, thus postulating there are biological processes preventing some cancers from shedding DNA in the
blood. If true, this would prohibit the use of ctDNA as a tumor biomarker that precedes imaging and clinical
manifestation of disease. Similar questions apply to early-stage tumors that test negative for ctDNA, but patients
do experience clinical recurrence: was ctDNA never there or was it simply too low to be detected? Yet, improved
detection techniques applied to ‘non-shedder’ cancers have recently led to major increases in the ctDNA
detection rate, converting previously ctDNA-negative samples to positive. This indicates that possibly all cancers
shed DNA in the circulation, but some can only be detected with methods providing extremely high sensitivity.
 This R01 competing continuation builds on two technologies developed during the first grant cycle and
can address the questions. (a) MAESTRO -minor allele enriched sequencing through recognition
oligonucleotides- that enables extremely high sensitivity MRD detection. And (b) Duplex Repair (DR) that
reduces noise during subsequent duplex sequencing. We aim to show that the combined technology, DS-DR-
MAESTRO enables detection of ctDNA as sensitive as a single tumor-cell genome-equivalent circulating in the
~5l human blood pool at the time of blood collection, while retaining specificity. This sensitivity can be achieved
following sequencing of the primary tumor and collecting total circulating-DNA (cfDNA) typically recovered from
a standard 10-40ml blood collection. We will optimize the technology to the level required for subsequent
application in clinical studies. Aims 1-2 will optimize the technical aspects of the technology using serial dilutions
of cfDNA from tumor patients and normal volunteers. Aim 3 will apply the technology for detection of minimal
residual disease in circulating DNA from esophageal cancer patients whose tumors tend to shed very little ctDNA.
Successful technology development is anticipated to extend the use of cfDNA for detecting MRD in low-shedder
cancers and significantly shrink the size of cancers detectable. It will also increase the predictive power for
multiple endpoints, and assist pre/post-surgery ctDNA management decisions, thereby providing a window of
opportunity for many additional patients and improving precision medicine."

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a hematologic malignancy that is characterized by constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly,
bone marrow (BM) fibrosis, and high risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MF is among the
most aggressive chronic myeloid neoplasms, with a median overall survival (OS) less than 4 years. Somatic
mutations in the JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes are common in ~85% of MF patients, and preclinical studies have
shown that these mutations result in constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to chronic
inflammation and BM fibrosis. Accordingly, the FDA has approved three JAK2 inhibitors, Ruxolitinib, Fedratinib,
and Pacritinib, based on their clinical improvements in constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and OS. However,
a substantial fraction of MF patients lack JAK2-activating mutations. Moreover, JAK2-activating mutations persist
in patients undergoing JAK2 inhibitor therapies and a subgroup of patients have suboptimal response to JAK2
inhibitors, underscoring the urgent need for developing new therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes.
 MYC is a transcription factor that controls cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Although MYC
plays important oncogenic roles in myeloid malignancies such as AML, its role in the MF pathogenesis is
unknown. Notably, our recent studies revealed that MYC copy number gain frequently occurs in MF patients and
that this is associated with increased levels of MYC protein expression in patient BM cells. Importantly, we have
shown that activation of MYC expression in mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is sufficient to provoke MF
independent of JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations, and that this requires upregulation of S100A9, an alarmin or
Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) protein that plays pivotal roles in inflammation and innate
immunity. Accordingly, the MYC-S100A9 axis underlies complex network of inflammatory signaling that involves
various hematopoietic cell types in the BM niche. Finally, we discovered that MYC also induces expansion of
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that are known as myofibroblasts contributing to the MF pathogenesis.
 These findings support the hypotheses that activation of MYC-alarmin pathway drives MF independent
of JAK2/CALR/MPL mutations and that inhibiting MYC or its target alarmins will improve clinical outcomes in MF
patients having increased MYC expression. To test these hypotheses, we will assess the preclinical activity of
pharmacologic agents targeting the MYC-S100A9 axis in MF and determine the mechanisms of MYC-directed
upregulation of S100A9 (Aim 1). Further, we will assess the roles of MYC-S100A9 circuit in activation and
expansion of myofibroblasts and their contribution to MF development (Aim 2). Finally, we will define the roles
of MYC and its target alarmins in MF driven by JAK2 pathway mutations (Aim 3). Collectively, this research will
provide important insights into a new molecular circuit connecting MYC and alarmin-mediated inflammation, and
will test if the MYC-alarmin axis represents a novel therapeutic vulnerability that can be targeted to improve
clinical outcomes in MF."

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)
being the most prevalent form. The primary risk factor for POAG, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), results
from pathology in the conventional outflow pathway. The IOP-dependent mechanical responsiveness of the
conventional outflow tissue is critical to the homeostatic maintenance of IOP in the normal range, however, the
mechanosensors and their transduction pathways, are not well-understood. In this project, we will examine one
mechanical sensor, caveolae, which we have found to play important roles in outflow cell contractile
processes. Gene variants at the CAV1/2 genes, which encode the essential proteins for caveolae formation,
reproducibly associate with POAG and, importantly, with IOP elevation. Ablation of CAV1 both globally and in
outflow cell-specific contexts results in ocular hypertension and defects in aqueous humor drainage from the
conventional outflow pathway. The cell-intrinsic mechanisms by which caveolae transduce responses to IOP
fluctuations and the connection between CAV1/2 gene variants not understood and this project expands on our
prior work to address these gaps in our understanding. We hypothesize that outflow pathway caveolae are
mechanosensitive/mechanoprotective platforms that transduce changes in IOP in the trabecular meshwork, the
Schlemm’s canal, and in the distal outlow pathway vasculature to dynamically regulate aqueous humor
drainage and thereby modulate IOP. We also predict that POAG-associated CAV1/2 risk variants impact the
mechanically-induced transcriptional program to build caveolae. The successful completion of these studies

Multiple lines of evidence point to the role of adaptive immunity as response to viral infections and/or as
misdirected autoimmune response in subjects with COPD and emphysema. There is support for an association
between adaptive immune responses and COPD progression, but a direct link has not been made. In this
proposal, we will utilize blood samples from 3,000 well-characterized subjects from the COPDGene Study, which
include longitudinal follow-up and extensive available omics datasets. We will employ state of the art Phage
ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) technology to efficiently and comprehensively assess samples for
autoantibodies and antibodies indicative of prior viral infections. Our first hypothesis is that previous infections with
respiratory viruses, or differential immune responses to viral infections, are associated with more rapid
progression of COPD, speciﬁcally lung function decline. The second hypothesis is that autoantibodies are
associated with COPD, emphysema, and more rapid lung function decline. Aim 1: Human Virome and Lung
Function Decline. We will test for associations between baseline viral antibodies and longitudinal decline in lung
function at the 5 and 10-year study visits. We will also measure antiviral antibodies at the 5-year visit and test for
lung function decline over the subsequent 5 years in subjects who acquire new or higher levels of specific viral
antibodies, signifying interval infections. We will test whether these effects are modified by host factors including
sex and HLA genotypes. Aim 2: Autoimmunity and COPD Outcomes. We will use PhIP-Seq to identify the
presence of autoantibodies, we and will test for association between autoantibodies and COPD status, lung
function decline, and quantitative emphysema parameters from chest CT scans. We will measure autoantibodies
at the 5-year visit and test for lung function decline over the subsequent 5 years in subjects who acquire new or
higher levels of autoantibodies. We will again test whether these effects are modified by host factors including sex
and HLA genotypes. Aim 3: Adaptive Immunity and Chronic Inflammation Using whole blood RNA-
sequencing data from the year 5 visit, we will derive gene expression scores representing antiviral and
inﬂammatory pathways. We will test the association of these gene expression scores with viral antibodies and
autoantibodies to discover novel drivers of persistent inﬂammation. We will validate the association of
inﬂammatory gene expression scores with lung function and CT emphysema in a larger sample of COPDGene
subjects with RNA-sequencing data. This proposal will complement the existing clinical, genetic and
transcriptomic data in COPDGene by incorporating viral exposures and autoantibodies into longitudinal models
of COPD progression. To accomplish this research, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise
in in PhIP-Seq, COPD phenotyping, molecular immunology, genetic epidemiology, biostatistics and
bioinformatics."

Oxidative stress affects the function of signaling molecules through posttranslational modifications of cysteine
residues, which in turn regulate survival and death of cardiomyocytes (CMs) during myocardial stress. We
have shown that thioredoxin1 (Trx1), a 12 kD oxidoreductase, modulates the function of signaling molecules,
including HDAC4, AMPK, mTOR, and Atg7, in the heart by modulating their cysteine residues through either
thiol-disulfide exchange or transnitrosylation. Here we will investigate a novel role of cysteine oxidation in
mediating the degradation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ ATPase 2a
(SERCA2a) during heart failure and its regulation through non-canonical interaction between p22phox,
SERCA2a and Trx1. SERCA2a mediates Ca2+ reuptake into the SR/ER. Reduced contractility in the failing
heart caused by impaired Ca2+ cycling between the sarcoplasm and SR and SERCA2a downregulation are
important drivers of heart failure progression. Although rescue of SERCA2a using adeno-associated virus 9
(AAV9)-mediated delivery is effective in animals, it does not appear fully effective in heart failure patients.
Complex posttranslational modifications of SERCA2a, including oxidation, acetylation and SUMOylation, may
not allow effective restoration of SERCA2a function with the current strategy. Oxidation of SERCA2a induces
proteolysis through the ubiquitin proteasome system. We discovered that mice with cardiac-specific deletion of
p22phox are more susceptible to heart failure during pressure overload (PO) even though bulk production of
reactive oxygen species is attenuated. In depth studies of the underlying mechanism suggest that endogenous
p22phox binds to SERCA2a, protects SERCA2a from oxidation of cysteine residues, including Cys498, and
prevents Smurf1/Hrd1-mediated proteasome degradation of SERCA2a during oxidative stress in vitro. These
results suggest that p22phox plays a previously unrecognized role in the regulation of the function of SERCA2a
function through direct interaction. We will test the following hypotheses: 1. p22phox protects the heart against
heart failure in response to PO by stabilizing SERCA2a through direct interaction. 2. p22phox stabilizes
SERCA2a against oxidative stress by mediating SERCA2a-Trx1 interaction, inhibiting oxidation of
SERCA2a cysteines, including Cys498, and preventing SERCA2a-Smurf1/Hrd1 interaction. To test these
hypotheses, we will use newly generated genetically altered mouse models, including p22phox cardiac specific
knock-out and SERCA2a(C498S) knock-in mice. We will use proteomic approaches to evaluate
posttranslational modification of cysteine residues in SERCA2a and demonstrate thiol-disulfide exchange
between SERCA2a and Trx1. Our study will not only demonstrate a novel noncanonical function of p22phox but
also clarify the detailed mechanism through which oxidation of SERCA2a at previously unrecognized cysteine
residues leads to proteasomal degradation during PO. The study will provide useful information for efficient
restoration of SERCA2a function during heart failure through modulation of cysteine oxidation."
10802651,"Burns affect >11 million people worldwide annually. A fourth of all burn injuries occur in children under age 16
and burns are a major source of morbidity and mortality in children. Treatment of large full thickness burns is a
major challenge due to limitations of autogenous skin, wound infection, severe metabolic stress and other
associated injuries. The long time to burn wound closure results in susceptibility to infection, prolonged pain and
long hospitalization. Human deceased donor skin allografts are a temporizing option for skin cover following
severe burn injury, but the grafts are soon rejected. While modern treatment provides survival from severe burns,
the healing leaves an imperfect result with scarring, disfiguration, loss of critical skin functions, and increased
vulnerability to late, cosmetic, psychological, and physical defects, especially in children. A breakthrough to
achieve regeneration of perfect skin has thus become a major aim in wound healing. In response to these
challenges, we propose to induce in situ skin regeneration through repopulation of skin allografts using our
recently discovered novel stem cell mobilizing therapy. In search for better therapy for organ transplantation
patients, a new two-drug combination (AMD3100=A, low-dose-FK506=F) or MRG was discovered
serendipitously that enabled long-term liver and kidney allograft survival with short-term treatment and freedom
from immunosuppression. This tolerance was associated with allograft chimerism (Host repopulation) and local
down regulation of the immune response. AF treatment also accelerated skin wound healing and promoted hair
follicle neogenesis. We hypothesize that in situ skin regeneration can be realized by host repopulation of skin
allografts through pharmacological mobilization of endogenous bone marrow stem cells with a mechanism
similar to protection from liver/kidney allograft rejection. Rejecting skin allografts may create a local environment
which facilitates recruitment of mobilized host stem cells, while recruited stem cells may differentiate into
components of skin and repopulate the allografts. Thus transplanted skin eventually become “self”. This “allograft
chimerism” approach represents a paradigm shift in which skin allografts are treated as “biological scaffolds”
which the host repopulates with circulating bone marrow derived stem cells, during which time the allografts are
protected from rejection. The main goals of this proposal are to understand the mechanisms of skin regeneration
through repopulation of skin allografts in small animal models and to demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of
our novel stem cell mobilizing therapy in repopulation of skin allografts in a preclinical large animal (swine) model
of full thickness burns. This work, if successful, will cause a paradigm shift using skin allografts and stem cell
mobilizing therapy to heal severe wounds/burns through scar free skin regeneration."

This K08 Career Development Proposal details the candidate’s research on the structural regulation of megalin
recycling in the kidney proximal tubule (PT) that will be conducted during a 5-year mentored award period.
With the guidance of his co-mentors at Columbia University, Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Barasch, along with oversight
from an experienced multi-institutional advisory committee, Dr. Beenken has designed a comprehensive plan
of didactics and intensive laboratory research in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and mass spectrometry.
This training will enable him to differentiate himself from his mentors and develop a body of research that he
can use to start an independent research laboratory as a physician-scientist. His ultimate goal is to translate
the understanding of structural mechanisms of megalin recycling to new treatments for proteinuric disease.
Megalin-dependent endocytosis in the PT enables protein capture that protects the kidney tubules from
damage due to proteinuria. Megalin must recycle between cell surface and endosomes to fulfill its endocytic
function, but the structural mechanisms that underlie this recycling are poorly understood. Dr. Beenken has
published cryo-EM structures of megalin at pH 7.5 and 5.2, revealing megalin’s structure at the cell surface
and in the late endosome. These structures demonstrated that megalin undergoes extensive pH-dependent
structural transitions to bind ligands from the urinary filtrate at the cell surface and then shed ligands in the
acidic endosomes. Dr. Beenken’s work led him to hypothesize that megalin adopts unique structures in
different endosomal compartments that are regulated by specific residues in megalin and depend on changes
in megalin’s coordination of Ca2+ ions. In his proposed research project, Dr. Beenken will test his hypothesis by
determining structures of megalin in different endosomal compartments including early and recycling
endosomes (Aim 1), characterizing pH-sensitive megalin residues during trafficking (Aim 2), and determining
the dependence of megalin recycling on Ca2+-coordination (Aim 3). Pursuing these research goals will lay the
groundwork for Dr. Beenken’s career in the structural biology of megalin receptor recycling in the PT and
enable him to become an independent investigator. Ultimately, he plans for his discoveries in the basic science
of megalin recycling in the PT to translate to clinical interventions for proteinuric disease."

We propose to determine i) the specific effects on eukaryotic translation of posttranscriptional modifications (PTMs) of
mRNA and tRNA and ii) how readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs) is modulated by downstream sequence
context and stimulated by translation readthrough inducing drugs (TRIDs). In so doing we will contribute to the
development of new therapeutic approaches for treatment of diseases which are linked to PTMs and PTCs. Our approach
is to apply a reconstituted in vitro system, denoted PURE‐LITE, to elucidate mechanisms of elongation and termination
using a combination of ensemble and single molecule approaches. Such studies can aid in interpreting the results of
related cellular and clinical studies and suggest new directions to pursue. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Determine the effects
of mRNA and tRNA posttranscriptional modifications on elongation and termination. m6A, pseudoU (,inosine (I) and
m5C are among the most common PTMs of eukaryotic mRNA. There currently are no direct measurements of how these
PTMs affect cognate elongation, misreading, readthrough and termination. We will determine which modifications have
the most pronounced effects on these processes and identify which steps during elongation and termination are
responsible for these effects, which are the most likely to be involved in altering translational functions in cells. We will
prepare mRNAs containing modifications in sense or nonsense codons, pair these modified codons with cognate and near‐
cognate tRNAs for the three elongation processes, and compare the rates and stoichiometries of elongation with those
obtained with the corresponding unmodified mRNAs and tRNAs. tRNAs will be selected to examine how different
modifications of nucleotides 34 and 37 of the anticodon loop affect assay results. Similar studies for termination will
compare modified and unmodified mRNAs. 2. Determine the effects on readthrough of UGA codons of downstream
sequence context and TRID termination inhibitors. There is strong evidence that UGA PTCs are the most susceptible to
readthrough and that sequences immediately downstream from a UGA PTC influence readthrough efficiency. Our results
have demonstrated that ataluren, the only TRID currently approved for treating patients with a PTC disease, acts
exclusively by competitively inhibiting release factor complex (RFC). Ataluren shows variable results in stimulating
readthrough, as measured in cell‐based assays and clinical trials. We hypothesize that this variability may be a
consequence of how PTC downstream sequence affects RFC activity. We will test this hypothesis by determining how
closely ataluren inhibition of RFC as a function of downstream sequence correlates with ataluren stimulation of
readthrough activity. Such tests will be repeated with ataluren added in combination with agents which stimulate
readthrough by a mechanism orthogonal to that of ataluren, potentially leading to synergistic results. The most effective
combinations will also be tested in cellular assays. In parallel experiments we will seek to identify TRID termination
inhibitors more potent than ataluren, via high throughput screening with a plate reader assay, virtual screening and
medicinal chemistry. These parallel efforts should improve the treatment of PTC‐based diseases and the selection of
patients most likely to benefit from such treatments."

Identifying risk variants and genes of immune diseases will not only improve our understanding of these
diseases, but also point to potential therapeutic targets. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are
commonly used to study complex diseases, and have been highly successful in a range of disorders, for
instance, more than 200 loci have been associated with the risk of asthma. Nevertheless, to translate these
associations to mechanistic understanding has been difficult, largely because most of the trait-associated
variants are located in noncoding regions with unknown functions. Current work has often been focused on the
variants in enhancer regions that may affect gene expression, yet growing evidence suggest that other
mechanisms, particularly those regulate RNA processing, may also be important.
 The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of functions of genetic variants by studying their
effects on N6-methyladenosine modification (m6A) of RNA molecules. M6A modification is a relatively new, yet
important mechanism of regulating RNA processing, including splicing, degradation, intracellular transport and
translation. Despite the widely accepted function of m6A at the molecular level, its contribution to genetics of
human disorders is largely unknown. Our recent work on m6A-modifying variants, called m6A-QTLs, in a
human B cell line, show shat these m6A-QTLs are enriched with GWAS-detected variants of immune-related
traits, and their effects are largely independent of those variants acting on gene expression or splicing,
representing a novel path from genetic to phenotypic variations. We propose to extend this work in several
directions. (1) We will map m6A-QTLs on mRNAs in several major immune cell types (B, CD4 and CD8 T, NK
and monocytes) from human blood, in both resting and immune-stimulated conditions. This study will map
many cell-type and response-specific m6A-QTLs that would be missed in a single cell type or condition. (2) We
will integrate these resources with GWAS data to identify specific m6A sites and genes that may play important
roles in immune phenotypes. This analysis will employ a novel statistical method that improves the power of
detecting m6A sites and genes with causal effects. (3) A recently discovered role of m6A is regulation of
chromatin-associated RNAs, especially those with regulatory functions (carRNAs), such as enhancer RNAs
and repeat-derived RNAs. We will also identify m6A-QTLs of these carRNAs in human T cells, and study their
contribution to human immune phenotypes."

PI: Jessica Mark Welch
Project Summary/Abstract
 Bacteria colonizing the human mouth play important roles not only in oral health, but in systemic health
and disease. This proposal addresses the key unsolved question of how spatial organization of the oral
microbiota is connected to its function at the micron scale. Our previous work pioneered the imaging of oral
microbiome biogeography by developing a Combinatorial Labeling And Spectral Imaging - Fluorescence in situ
Hybridization (CLASI-FISH) strategy to analyze the micron-scale architecture of microbial communities at a
systems level. In this project we build on these findings to investigate structure-function relationships, assess
complexity of consortia at micrometer scales within single human hosts, and develop multiplexed live cell
imaging to study the dynamics of multispecies in vitro biofilms at the single-cell level.
 In Aim 1 we investigate how a key parameter of host-microbiome interaction, salivary nitrate
concentration, affects the structure of the bacterial biofilm on the tongue dorsum. The nitrate-reducing
capability of bacteria on the tongue plays a major role in the generation of nitric oxide, which impacts
vasodilation and control of blood pressure. In turn, the secretion of nitrate into saliva by salivary glands affects
the metabolism and composition of the tongue microbiota. Using dietary nitrate supplementation of volunteers,
we will quantify the spatial organization of nitrate-metabolizing taxa in tongue biofilm consortia that developed
in high and low salivary nitrate concentrations, and we will use whole-genome shotgun sequence data to
determine which species and strains are responsive to nitrate.
 In Aim 2 we address an almost entirely unexplored question: in micron-scale neighborhoods in the oral
microbiome, does each species function as a clone or as a complex mixture of strains? The answer to this
question is important for learning to manipulate and modulate the oral microbiome and determining whether,
for purposes such as microbiome transplants or building an in vitro biofilm model, a single strain is an
adequate representative of the community. We will address this question by microdissection of single tongue
dorsum consortia 100-200 micrometers in diameter, followed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and
analysis to assess whether natural oral consortia are made up of clones or complex populations.
 Live imaging is a powerful method of analysis of taxon-taxon interactions, but multiplexed live imaging
of bacteria with single-cell resolution has been almost entirely absent from studies of the oral microbiome. The
goal of Aim 3 is to develop a live-imaging system, using vital dyes, to differentiate up to 6 taxa within live
simplified communities. We will use this system to investigate the dynamics of taxon-taxon interactions in
consortia representing components of dental plaque and the tongue biofilm. Our goal is to learn how members
of the oral microbiome respond to one another under controlled conditions, and to evaluate whether these in
vitro systems develop spatial organization resembling those of natural communities."

Increasing evidence demonstrates that suboptimal conditions in the womb, including poor maternal nutrition,
contributes to obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk. One potential contributor to poor maternal nutrition is
chronic consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS). Studies indicate that approximately 30% of pregnant
women and 44% of lactating women in the United States regularly consume NNS. However, a growing body of
evidence demonstrates that NNS consumption is paradoxically associated with obesity and metabolic risk
factors. While effects of NNS consumption during pregnancy and lactation on maternal and infant metabolic
health are not well understood, the available evidence suggests cause for concern. For example, NNS
consumption during pregnancy increases maternal blood sugar and induces fetal hypoglycemia and growth
restriction in mice – both of which are risk factors for offspring obesity. Further, three prospective cohort studies
in humans have reported an association between maternal NNS consumption and childhood weight or adiposity,
although another found no relationship. Our own pilot data indicate that NNS consumption during pregnancy
increases infant fat mass and disrupts the infant gut microbiome at 1 month of age. However, the limited,
contradictory, and observational nature of the human evidence collected to date has made it difficult to establish
guidelines around NNS consumption during pregnancy. We therefore propose the first randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to examine the effects of NNS during pregnancy and lactation. We will recruit 324 pregnant women
who frequently consume NNS (≥7 servings/week) and examine the effects of NNS restriction on maternal and
infant metabolic outcomes. Pregnant women will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) no NNS
restriction (control); 2) NNS restriction during lactation only; and 3) NNS restriction during pregnancy and
lactation. The intervention will consist of monthly consultations with a dietitian to provide counseling on
replacement of NNS consumption with unsweetened food and beverage alternatives and home delivery of such
alternatives. Adherence will be assessed via 24-hour dietary recalls and by objectively measuring NNS
concentrations in urine and breast milk. Our primary aims will be to determine the effects of NNS-restriction on:
1) infant body composition at 1 and 6 months of age; 2) maternal glucose tolerance at 24-28 weeks’ gestation;
and, 3) infant gut microbiome and fecal metabolites at 1 and 6 months of age. We hypothesize that NNS
restriction among pregnant women who habitually consume NNS during pregnancy and/or lactation will reduce
infant fat mass (compared to a no NNS restriction (usual NNS intake) control group), via improvements to
maternal glycemia and the infant gut microbiome and metabolome, with the greatest benefit in the pregnancy
and lactation group. This research could shape recommendations around NNS consumption during pregnancy
and lactation, thereby potentially reducing the global burden of obesity and cardiometabolic disease."

Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent monotherapy is the current mainstay
for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD). Despite its vision saving benefit, some
patients fail to respond to the treatment because of insufficient therapeutic effect and/or the socioeconomic
burden of frequently required repeat injections. Therefore, the long-term goal of our studies is to develop superior
or adjunctive approaches to the current anti-VEGF therapy that can provide active targeting of NVAMD, have
the capacity to deliver multiple drugs, and maintain long-term efficacy. Exosomes are naturally occurring, cell
secreted, and nano-sized extracellular vesicles. Exosomes carry various cargos including microRNAs, proteins,
and lipids for cell-to-cell communications. Recently, we have shown that intravitreally delivered ASL-exosomes
composed of Anchor, Spacer, and Arg-Gly-Asp acid (RGD) Ligand-modification actively target choroidal
neovascularization (CNV) with adequate retinal penetration. The unique nature of exosomes and our study
demonstrate great promise in exosomes as the next regeneration intraocular drug delivery system. However,
the accelerated translation to humans has been hindered due to a lack of clarity as to mechanisms of exosome
uptake within the retina thus preventing a standardized formulation and an optimized therapeutic application of
exosomes. The objective of the current studies is to elucidate the extracellular and intracellular mechanisms by
which ASL-exosomes actively target ocular NV and to use this information in optimizing this drug delivery system
for simultaneous delivery of Aflibercept and miR-24 to suppress ocular NV and its secondary fibrosis through
independent pathways. Our proposed studies will test the hypothesis that intravitreally delivered ASL-exosomes
allow their targeted delivery to ocular NV lesions through active binding to increasingly expressed
transmembrane integrins at NV sites and through increased intracellular uptake of exosomes by integrin
receptor-mediated intracellular endocytosis. Further, we hypothesize that the ASL-exosome system that is
complemented with active targeting and sustained multi-drug delivery capacity with minimal immune responses
can effectively suppress NV and fibrosis by co-delivering Aflibercept and miR-24, a new intracellular target for
retinal fibrosis. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. Aim 1 is to determine the
mechanism by which ASL-exosomes actively target ocular NV. Aim 2 is to optimize the formulation of multi-
drugs loaded ASL-exosomes. Aim 3 is to determine sustained multi-drug delivery using exosomes and related
immune responses. The research proposed in this application is innovative because the combination of an
exosome-based intraocular drug delivery system with active targeting is a novel strategy that has the potential
to change the current treatment paradigm from passive targeting-directed monotherapy to active targeting-
directed multi-drug delivery with sustained efficacy for the treatment of various retinal and choroidal vascular
diseases."

Blindness is devasting condition that impacts millions of people across the world. In most cases of adult-onset
blindness there is damage or dysfunction of the eye, retina, or optic nerve, but the visual cortex is left intact.
Direct electrical stimulation of visual cortex, even in blind patients, produces perception of distinct spots of light
known as phosphenes. It has long been recognized that this could form the basis for a visual cortical prosthesis
(VCP), a device which could greatly improve the quality of life for blind patients by restoring some visual function.
In recent years, there has been renewed interest in development of VCPs due to technical advances in
computing, wireless data and power transmission, and electrode arrays. While these advances have greatly
improved the interface with the cerebral cortex, substantial research is still required to determine how to use that
interface to communicate visual information using electrical stimulation. VCPs have typically used electrical
stimulation delivered in a way that provides an unnatural input to the visual cortex. This includes using a
sequence of electrical stimulation pulses delivered at an arbitrary fixed frequency and delivered in a manner that
is unrelated to ongoing cortical activity. Electrical stimulation delivered in this unnatural fashion has been one of
the key limitations in the development of effective VCPs. This proposal focuses on multiple ways to deliver
electrical stimulation in a more naturalistic fashion. Aim 1 examines the importance of stochastic variability in the
timing and amplitude of electrical stimulation pulses in generation of visual percepts. Aim 2 evaluates the
importance of coordinating electrical stimulation relative to patterns of ongoing cortical activity. If naturalistic
stimulation is more effective in generating visual percepts, this should be accompanied by more effective
activation of visual pathways, and this will be explicitly tested in Aim 3. This will be done by combining electrical
stimulation of visual cortex with functional imaging. Naturalistic electrical stimulation protocols could lower the
current requirements for future VCPs, and therefore improve device safety and longevity. More generally, the
results from these experiments may reveal general principals of how to effectively and efficiently encode
information into the cerebral cortex in other brain computer interface applications. Furthermore, determining the
most effective ways to input information into the brain using electrical stimulation could improve scientific
understanding of normal mechanisms of cortical information processing and the relationship between cortical
activity and perception."
10803036,"Project Summary/Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death in American women and metastasis is the
major reason of BC-related mortality. Harnessing the immune system to battle cancer via immunotherapy has
emerged as a powerful and potentially revolutionizing strategy for treating cancer metastasis. Although cancer
immunotherapy strategies have shown success in treating hematological malignancies, their use for destroying
solid tumors needs further improvement. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key
factor that contributes to the poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy of solid tumors.
 Cryosurgery has been proposed as a promising strategy to modulate the TME. It is done by freezing to
cause ice formation (i.e., frostbite) in tumor, which may lead to immunogenic cell death, shape an immune-
active TME, and provoke antitumor immunity. Unlike hyperthermic therapy for which irreversible vascular stasis
occurs during heating, there is a temporary (a few hours) reperfusion of the tumor after thawing a frozen tumor
iceball. This enhances immune cell infiltration into the tumor after cryosurgery, compared to heating. However,
cryosurgery alone is insufficient to activate a potent immune response against cancer via modulating the TME.
 Moreover, cryosurgery has been used in the clinic for treating cancer, especially BC. This is because it is
minimally invasive with minimal cosmetic damage compared to surgical resection, and the hyperechoic frozen
BC tumor iceball can be conveniently monitored in real time with medical ultrasonography. Unfortunately, a
temperature of -20 °C or lower is needed for complete cell death, while the temperature in the periphery of a
frozen tumor iceball is > -20 °C. This may result in incomplete tumor killing and cancer recurrence. Thus,
combining cryosurgery with other therapies including immunotherapy has been studied to improve cancer
killing in the peripheral region of a frozen tumor iceball. Although this is promising to kill localized tumor, an
effective abscopal/immunization effect of cryoimmunotherapy against distant/metastatic tumors has not been
reported and no nanomaterial has been used to enhance cryoimmunotherapy, until a recent study of us.
 In this study, we developed a cold-responsive nanoparticle (CRNP) that targets cancer cells actively and
releases its payload (chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents) specifically into the cytosol in responsive to
the cold temperature in the periphery of a frozen tumor iceball, for combining with cryosurgery. This induces a
potent cryoimmune response against not only primary tumors with freezing but also distant and rechallenged
metastatic tumors without cryosurgery (i.e., the abscopal and immunization effects). We hypothesize the
efficacy and safety of the novel cryoimmunotherapy strategy can be further improved by 1), developing the
CRNP to actively target both cancer cells and tumor vasculature and 2), delivering chemotherapy and
immunotherapy agents that both perform their therapeutic function in the cytosol. The novel dual-targeting
CRNP-potentiated cryoimmunotherapy may be invaluable for combating metastasis of BC and other cancers."
10803121,"Project Summary. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how transcription by RNA
polymerase II (RNApII) is coupled to RNA processing, chromatin modifications, and termination. This project
previously produced a model in which the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNApII subunit Rpb1 displays
characteristic phosphorylation patterns at different stages of the transcription cycle to promote binding of the
appropriate factors for co-transcriptional RNA processing. The fundamental knowledge generated by this
project provides significant insight into how the CTD phosphorylation cycle affects medically important
processes such as the stimulation of HIV transcription by the viral Tat protein and ""pausing"" of RNApII at
developmentally regulated genes. This project is necessary to better understand both the enzymes that
mediate the changes in CTD phosphorylation (kinases, phosphatases, etc.) as well as the proteins that
recognize these patterns.
 In the next funding period, three specific aims will be pursued, with a focus on measuring dynamics of
events during transcription. The first aim continues our work directly analyzing CTD phosphorylation sites by
mass spectrometry. A modified CTD (msCTD) was engineered to directly assign phosphorylation sites by
mass, and in the previous period we developed a vastly improved peptide chromatography and analysis
pipeline. This will be used to analyze phosphorylation in yeast cells or extracts where various CTD modifying
enzymes are inactivated or depleted, and to determine the specificity of CTD binding proteins or CTD
antibodies. We will also extend msCTD analysis to mammalian and plant cells. The second aim studies three
proteins, each related to CTD phosphorylation and transcription elongation, that possess long “linker” domains
that apparently function as flexible arms. Using multiple approaches, we will probe how Tfb3 connects the
Kin28/Cdk7 kinase module to the body of TFIIH, how the Ctr9 “trestle” functions within the PAF complex to
facilitate transcription through nucleosomes, and how the Abd1 cap methyltransferase functions in elongation.
The third aim continues our single-molecule microscopy analysis of transcription elongation. We can visualize
individual transcription events with up to three fluorescently-labeled transcription factors, providing second to
millisecond time resolution of binding kinetics. We will measure the stoichiometries, order of binding, and
cooperative interactions between multiple CTD binding and elongation complex factors. Altogether, this project
will make a unique contribution to our understanding of gene expression by providing a time-resolved picture of
events that complements inherently static techniques such as structural studies or genomics."
10798172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Toxoplasma gondii can have devastating consequences in the developing fetus if it is acquired during
pregnancy. A significant number of congenital T. gondii infections occur yearly (~4000 in the U.S. and over
200,000 worldwide), making T. gondii among the most important teratogenic pathogens. To date it is not possible
to predict whether infection of a T. gondii-naïve pregnant woman will ultimately transmit to the fetus. Congenital
toxoplasmosis occurs only after T. gondii breaches the placental barrier, yet very little is known about the cellular
and molecular events that occur during this host-pathogen interaction, nor how these events affect infection
outcome. In this proposal we outline a series of complementary experiments aimed at understanding what
happens when Toxoplasma gondii encounters cells of the placenta and how this might impact infection
outcome in the developing fetus. A major focus of our work is on placental trophoblasts which form the primary
interface between the developing fetus and maternal blood. Our extensive preliminary and published data firmly
establish that placental syncytiotrophoblasts (SYNs) but not cytotrophoblasts (CYTs) resist Toxoplasma
infection, and that Toxoplasma infection of trophoblasts induces a transcriptional response that is unique
compared to most cell types studied to date. In Aim 1 we exploit multiple genetically tractable models of SYN
function and development to identify SYN resistance mechanisms and validate them at the molecular level.
Significance of this aim derives from the fact that SYNs are unique in being the only cell type studied to date
that is intrinsically resistant to T. gondii infection. In Aim 2 we address the importance of innate immune signaling
at the maternofetal interface during congenital transmission. In Subaim 2.2. we will do this by quantifying
multiple immunomodulatory cytokines in a unique set of human serum samples that longitudinally cover
gestational seroconversion events during pregnancy, and then use multivariate analyses to link immune
signaling profiles to different infection outcomes. In Subaim 2.2. we will genetically ablate multiple host-targeting
effectors in T. gondii (including one that alters the immunoregulatory landscape specifically in placental cells),
and link congenital transmission dynamics to the immunomodulatory landscape in a well-established mouse
model of congenital transmission. Impact of the proposed studies derives from (1) the use of primary placental
tissues and tractable cell line models of CYTs and SYNs to decode critical molecular mechanisms of resistance
and susceptibility, (2) the use of serum samples before, during and after T. gondii infection to robustly quantify
changes in the host response during congenital exposure events and (3) the synergistic and well-established
collaboration of the co-PI team (Coyne and Boyle) which leverages their expertise in the molecular biology of
Toxoplasma host-pathogen interactions (Boyle) and the cellular and molecular basis of placental development
and pathogen resistance (Coyne)."
10798177,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Evidence shows that maternal stress exposure during pregnancy can have enduring effects on offspring
emotion regulation (ER), a transdiagnostic factor underlying the development of psychopathology. Although
low-income and minority race women are more likely to experience daily recurring stressors, significant
variability exists in the way individuals respond to stressors during pregnancy. Few studies have focused on
identifying modifiable, protective factors during pregnancy that explain these individual differences, a critical
step to informing preventative interventions. Guided by resilience theories, this study takes a daily-life
approach to investigate the prospective association between maternal stress regulation during pregnancy and
infant ER. The central hypothesis is that day-to-day fluctuations in prenatal psychosocial resources (social
support, self-efficacy) will have a protective influence on daily maternal stress regulation during pregnancy
(Aim 1) that, in turn, shapes infant ER outcomes (Aim 2). The study will recruit pregnant participants (N=90)
with a history of chronic stress from the Pittsburgh Girls Study (ECHO-PGS; UH3OD023244), a longitudinal
cohort of women currently aged 24-27 (71% Black; 79% low-income) who have been assessed annually since
childhood. Participants will complete a prenatal lab visit, 10 days of ambulatory data collection, and a postnatal
lab visit when their infant is 6-months old. This study will leverage available prenatal and infant data from the
ECHO-PGS while adding state-of-the-art ambulatory measures (smartphone, wearable biosensing devices) to
measure real-world changes in daily stressful events, stress regulation, and psychosocial resources during
pregnancy, in addition to adding new physiological measures of ER in infancy. Dr. Tung, the award candidate,
is a developmental psychopathologist with significant experience conducting longitudinal research in the lab-
setting from middle childhood through early adulthood. In this K01, the candidate will gain targeted conceptual
and methodological training in: (1) ER during infancy, when regulatory processes are emerging and sensitive
to stress transmission, (2) ambulatory measures of daily prenatal stress regulation outside the lab setting, and
(3) advanced statistical approaches for intensive longitudinal data. Dr. Tung’s mentors (Drs. Hipwell, Low, and
Smyth) and consultants (Drs. Fox and Krafty) are ideally suited to guide the candidate’s training given their
combined expertise in the fields of prenatal stress, infant affective and physiological regulation, ambulatory
assessment, and intensive longitudinal data analytics. As a leading research institution, the University of
Pittsburgh Department of Psychiatry is an optimal scientific training environment to meet these career
development goals. The proposed K01 is the first step in a larger program of independent research that will
focus on prenatal stress and resilience factors underlying transdiagnostic vulnerability to psychopathology.
This line of work has the potential to advance the field by elucidating resilience processes during sensitive
windows of development to inform early preventative interventions."
10798287,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The WISDOM Study (Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of risk) is a
pragmatic trial comparing a personalized approach to breast cancer screening – in which the
intensity and modality of screening is dependent upon stratified personal risk -- against the gold
standard of annual screening. The goal is to determine whether a personalized approach is as
safe, less morbid, better accepted by women, encourages uptake of preventive interventions,
and is of higher health care value (better outcomes at less cost psychologically, physically, and
financially).
In this proposal `Expanding the WISDOM Study's Diversity, Reach, and Generalizability', we are
seeking support to expand the study to additional sites around the country to enhance
recruitment, improve study power and increase both the geographic and population diversity of
study participants. By doing so, our intention is to increase the generalizability of the study
results. Using a unique coverage with evidence progression model, we have secured insurance
coverage and outreach collaboration from multiple payers, giving us the opportunity to enroll
from an additional population of ~6 million women across multiple regions and varied ethnic and
socioeconomic backgrounds. The network of sites that this proposal will enable us to add will
allow us to create a collaborative group to continuously improve screening and learn who is at
risk for what kind of cancer.
The personalized screening arm includes a risk assessment based on family history, exposures,
breast density, co-morbidity and genetic predisposition (presence of mutations in the 9 genes
associated with screening and the combination of the small variation in inherited genes, the
single nucleotide polymorphisms, into a polygenic risk score or PRS). Importantly, the PRS
score is tailored to different ethnicities based on advances in the science of risk assessment,
allowing us to translate these important findings into practice. We are using an adaptive
approach in which the risk model is updated over the course of the trial as new information
emerges. The personalized approach yields an integrated risk score that allows us to assign an
age to start, an age to stop, a frequency of screening, and a modality for screening.
The R01 Specific Aims are to:
1. Open new clinical sites with experience enrolling targeted populations and use culturally
 targeted materials to increase the numbers in and diversity of the WISDOM study
population
2. Enhance trial enrollment and retention through national partnerships, centralized campaigns
 across the network and embedded analytics with real time feedback"

This project is to develop strategies to promote maturation of engineered cardiac microtissues containing
cardiomyocytes derived form induced pluripotent stem cells to serve as a novel in vitro cardiac tissue model.
Traditional 2D cardiac cell culture model systems have many limitations, such as the inability to fully reproduce
the cellular microenvironment in vivo, changes in cell morphology, phenotypes, and bioactivities
in comparison with their in vivo counterparts. Engineered human cardiac microtissues (cMTs) made of cardiac
cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great potentials to become an ideal 3D
cardiac tissue model. However, the fetal-like state of hiPSCs derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have results
in compromised functionality of these engineered cMTs. Many approaches have been used to mature hiPSC-
CMs. But maturation of hiPSC-CMs has not yet been fully achieved. Here, we hypothesize that interactions
between vascularized cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) and hiPSC-CMs are critical to promote phenotypic and
functional maturation of the engineered human cMTs. Our hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing three
specific aims: (1) Assess the effects of vascularized cardiac ECM on maturation of hiPSC-CMs; (2) Engineer
human cardiac microtissues composed of vascularized cardiac ECM and hiPSC derived cardiac cells; and (3)
Determine the roles of mechanical stimulation in improving maturity of engineered human cMTs. Our findings
will generate new scientific knowledge on the roles that cardiac ECM and vasculature play in maturation of
cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue. The developed methods and platforms will facilitate the discovery of new
developmental drivers to cell and tissue maturation. This project will be an important step towards the
development of 3D cardiac constructs with structural, physiological, and functional properties resembling human
native cardiac tissue, which are crucial for new drug development and studying pathological mechanisms.
Furthermore, this project will greatly enhance research infrastructure at the University of Akron and provide
opportunities for underrepresented students to be professionally trained and gain extensive research
experiences in stem cells, natural biomaterials and cardiac tissue engineering."
10795445,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is alarmingly high among patients with primary malignant brain tumors, who
face the certainty of tumor recurrence given the current insufficient curative treatment options and who will
experience a resultant lifetime of oncological and neurological sequelae. Moderate-to-severe levels of FCR can
have dire consequences for cancer patients, such as impeding daily function, activating maladaptive coping
patterns, and reducing medical treatment adherence. FCR also plays a significant role in the lives of family
members—our work shows rates of FCR among brain tumor caregivers are higher than the patients themselves.
Despite this, existing psychological interventions targeting FCR are not translatable to neuro-oncology and
contain discriminatory inclusion criteria prohibiting our brain tumor patients and caregivers from participation. In
response to this historic inequity and the vital need, our team developed FearLess: a novel, evidence-informed,
mindfulness-based, cognitive-existential, manualized psychological intervention targeting FCR in neuro-
oncology populations. However, study feasibility and acceptability issues remain. We identified three information
gaps specific to recruitment methodology, study population suitability, and control group feasibility in need of
resolution prior to FearLess protocol finalization and intervention implementation in larger-scale trials. First, to
identify ideal recruitment methods, we need to evaluate the feasibility of a cohesive multimodal national
recruitment strategy for both neuro-oncology patients (n=40) and caregivers (n=40). Second, to refine the
appropriate study population, we need to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the FearLess intervention
and associated study procedures across stratification groups (recurrent status and participant role). Lastly, to
investigate the appropriateness of a control group, we need to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
randomized waitlist-control in both patients and caregivers. As such, the proposed study is a Phase IIb
randomized waitlist-controlled trial, per the NIH ORBIT Model, assessing the feasibility and acceptability
of recruitment strategies, target population, and appropriateness of a waitlist control group in order to
finalize the protocol of FearLess for primary malignant brain tumor patients and caregivers. Eighty
participants will be randomized to either immediate intervention or waitlist control. Randomization will be stratified
by recurrence status (newly diagnosed or recurrent) and participant role (patient or caregiver). Recruitment
strategy will be evaluated by outlet yield and cost. We will assess feasibility and acceptability metrics throughout
enrollment, intervention, and follow-up periods including screening completion rate, eligibility rate, enrollment
rate, intervention adherence, intervention satisfaction, as well as retention, and evaluate whether these metrics
differ between multifactorial stratification groups (newly diagnosed v. recurrent; patients v. caregivers). Given
the underrepresentation of neuro-oncology in FCR studies, this study will yield critical knowledge prior to
finalizing the FearLess protocol for larger-scale trials."

 Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major health problem worldwide. Patients with the disease have
atherosclerotic lesions which impair blood flow to their limbs resulting in complications such as non-healing
wounds and amputations as well as pain and decreased quality of life. While many medical therapies have been
established to slow disease progression through controlling risk factors, the two most effective treatments at
improving a patient’s status are surgical or endovascular repair and supervised exercise therapy. While exercise
is an ideal treatment due to its lower cost and non-invasive nature, the mechanisms by which it improves patient
outcomes are still not known preventing the development of an ideal therapeutic strategy. This proposal
investigates a novel mechanism by which skeletal muscle satellite cells mediate these observed improvements.
Preliminary data shows that satellite cells generate several different proteins which are associated with vascular
growth and drive migration in vascular cells. Histological staining of human samples shows that satellite cells
increase in patients that see improvements with exercise and the presence of satellite cells appears to be critical
for recovery in an exercise preconditioning murine model. Aim 1 will investigate the causal relationship between
satellite cells and exercise mediated recovery using an murine model in which satellite cells are selectively
ablated. Aim 2 will use single cell sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity of satellite cells in response to
exercise and determine which stimuli and which specific expression profiles are the most vasculogenic. Finally,
Aim 3 will quantify the expression changes and heterogeneity in satellite cells from PAD patients isolated before
and after supervised exercise therapy. The goal of this aim is to determine how differences in satellite cell
populations correlate with clinical responses in the patients. The ultimate goal of this project is to understand
the biology and response of satellite cells in response to exercise to help develop more effective exercise
regimens for patients with PAD."

 Chronic respiratory disease is a major public health problem accounting for billions of dollars in
healthcare costs and substantial morbidity and mortality for individuals and families worldwide. Recently the
field of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) has demonstrated the key role that perinatal
life plays in determining adult health by setting growth trajectories that carry forward from fetal fetal/infancy life
stages. We propose that environmental metal exposures in utero and in infancy set in motion adverse
respiratory health conditions that manifest later in life, and can first be measured during adolescence, a period
of rapid lung growth and development. Evidence regarding the impact of metal exposure, particularly mixtures
of metals, on lung growth in childhood is lacking and may explain a substantial proportion of later life
respiratory disease given their prevalence. This makes perinatal metal exposures a global health concern. The
effects of early life metal exposures vary based not only on dose, but also on the timing of exposure.
Therefore, research is urgently needed to better understand the developmental windows that explain the later
life health effects from perinatal exposures, as well as the molecular mechanisms through which they influence
children’s lung growth.
 To address these issues we will time- and cost-effectively conduct a longitudinal study of metals and
lung function by leveraging the infrastructure of the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment,
and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) study, a well-characterized prospective birth cohort based in Mexico City.
The proposed study will phenotype 600 children aged 13-16 years who have been followed since pregnancy,
thereby conducting a prospective, longitudinal study that covers pregnancy, infancy, childhood and
adolescence and linking these data with gold standard lung growth phenotyping using pre- and post-
bronchodilator spirometry at two time points during adolescence. We will use state of art exposure biomarkers
for metals assessed by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to measure metal
exposure in a time sensitive, yet cumulative manner from pregnancy to childhood. Finally, we use biomarkers
of cumulative oxidative stress assessed by mitochondrial DNA damage in nasal cells, the upper most end of
the respiratory tract, and a natural target tissue. Our goal is to use dose and time-specific measures of toxic
metals to assess their effects on lung growth trajectories individually and as a mixture. We hypothesize that
metals adversely affect lung growth trajectories via oxidative stress that can be estimated in the respiratory
tract using nasal cell heteroplasmy, a count of mitochondrial DNA mutations correlating with cumulative
oxidative stress. We anticipate that our findings will generate novel information on the impact of in utero and
early-life metal exposure on lung function and will inform prevention and treatment strategies to improve lung

A mechanistic model of pathogenic communication among immune, stromal and epithelial cells controlled by elaborate cytokine networks that underlies pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been proposed. The next critical step is to establish the spatiotemporal organization of this abnormal immune response. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are ectopic disorganized lymphoid aggregates found around intestinal inflammatory lesions in patients with CD and UC, possibly in response to persisting pathobionts that breach intestinal mucosa. TLS are recognized as a pathologic hallmark in IBD, however, their precise cellular composition and mechanistic contribution to intestinal immunity and pathogenesis of IBD are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to unravel the mechanisms that drive TLS formation and elucidate their function in mouse models of colitis relevant to IBD Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) that comprise dendritic cell (DC) and macrophage (M) subsets are an important constituent of TLS. In a model of Salmonella colitis, we identified a subset of mucosa-resident (CX3CR1hi) Ms that functions as an antigen-presenting cell driving TLS formation and a Salmonella-specific T cell-dependent IgA response in TLS. We found that TLS play a protective role in Salmonella colitis by restricting systemic pathogen dissemination, but under conditions of chronic inflammation observed in IBD, TLS are likely to acquire a proinflammatory role. Such conversion of TLS function may occur via promotion of TLS-associated pathogenic T cell differentiation and proinflammatory IgG instead of IgA responses as suggested by recent single cell transcriptional analyses of human IBD. Our overall hypothesis is that a key step in the pathogenesis of IBD is dysregulation of CX3CR1hi Ms, and that such dysregulated Ms promote IBD by driving the development of pathogenic TLS that produce T-cell dependent IgG instead of IgA. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of antigen-presentation and B cell activation by CX3CR1hi Ms in the development of pathogenic TLS; and Aim 2 will establish the role of TNF signaling in CX3CR1hi Ms in the regulation of TLS function. If successful, the study will provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of IBD and identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets (e.g., CX3CR1hi M-derived mediators) associated with TLS in IBD."
10789922,"-γ-producing Th1 cells have been extensively studied for development of novel vaccines and therapeutics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. However, recent studies demonstrate that Mtb-specific Th1 cells alone do not predict protection against tuberculosis (TB). Therefore, although Th1 cells are required for controlling Mtb replication, other types of immune cells may be needed to prevent infection and eradicate the bacteria. We recently found that a subset of IL-9-producing CD4+ T cells (Th9) can mediate protective immunity against Mtb infection. Th9 cells can be differentiated from naïve CD4+ T cells with TGF-β and IL-4, and play important roles in antitumor immunity and immunity related to allergic reactions. The role of Th9 cells in Mtb infection, however, remain largely unknown. We discovered a role for Th9 cells in TB immunity when we analyzed the transcriptomes in CD4+ T cells from healthy volunteers vaccinated with BCG and from people with latent TB infection (LTBI). IL-9 mRNA in CD4+ T cells topped the list of genes increased after BCG vaccination and LTBI. A significant increase in IL-9 production by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells after stimulation with infectious Mtb was observed only in LTBI patients and people vaccinated with oral (PO) BCG, indicating induction of Mtb-specific Th9 memory responses. To test whether Th9 cells mediate intracellular Mtb killing, we differentiated Mtb-specific Th9 cells from ESAT6-TCR transgenic mice and co-cultured these Th9 cells with Mtb-infected murine macrophages. Intracellular mycobacterial growth was significantly reduced in macrophages after interacting with Th9 cells. Moreover, neutralizing IL-9 abolished the inhibitory effects of Th9 cells, while addition of recombinant IL-9 alone inhibited intracellular bacterial growth. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Mtb-specific Th9 cells into syngeneic RAG1/2-/- mice suppresses Mtb growth in vivo. In addition, we found that IL-9 was increased and Mtb growth decreased in mice deficient in MCPIP1, a new RNA-binding protein affecting T cell activation. Deletion of MCPIP1 in Th9 cells resulted in a significantly enhanced IL-9 production upon restimulation. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that Mtb-specific Th9 cells represent a distinct subset of CD4+ T cells important for protective TB immunity. Strategies inducing Mtb- specific Th9 cells could be used to develop more effective TB vaccines and/or immunotherapies. We propose three aims to test this novel hypothesis: Aim 1 to determine the effects of Mtb-specific Th9 cells on protective TB immunity; Aim 2 to define the roles of IL-9 in vaccine-induced protection against Mtb infection using genetically engineered mice, and Aim 3 to identify the source for IL-9 in PBMC and BAL cells from BCG vaccinated individuals, and the mechanisms of Mtb-specific Th9 cell-mediated bacterial killing in human macrophages. These studies will have a significant impact on improving our understanding of host protective immune mechanisms against Mtb infection, and provide the rationale for targeting Mtb-specific Th9 cells as a new strategy for more effective TB vaccines and/or immunotherapies against Mtb infection."
10785702,"The efficacy of current cancer immunotherapies is limited in terms of upfront responsiveness in subsets of treated
patients and durability of responses. Significant efforts are being made to increase upfront responsiveness in
more patients by combination therapies. However, enhancing the durability of responses continues to be a
significant clinical challenge. The durability of responses to cancer immunotherapies is limited by the formation
of immunological memory, and our understanding of immune cell biology is insufficient, lacking safe and effective
ways to enhance T cells with memory phenotype.
 CD4+T cells play important roles in mediating anti-tumor immune responses, in terms of helper, cytotoxic,
and importantly, memory functions. In particular, CD4+T subsets, such as central memory (cm) CD4+T cells, are
well established for promoting immunological memory during pathological conditions such as infection or cancer.
Low memory T cell populations are a major underlying reason for transient anti-tumor immunity and responses
to immunotherapies. Efforts aimed at specifically increasing memory CD4+T cell populations include adoptive
cell transfer, which involves ex vivo sorting of intratumoral memory T cells followed by reinfusion into the patient.
However, this approach is limited by baseline paucity of intratumoral T cells. Safe and effective ways to increase
abundance, fitness, and activity of memory CD4+T cells are lacking and represent an urgent unmet clinical need.
 We recently discovered that oral administration of the dietary sugar L-fucose (L-fuc) to melanoma-bearing
mice increases intratumoral immune cells that suppress tumor growth (Lester et al. 2023 Nature Cancer). We
delineated a key mechanism underlying this immune-mediated anti-tumor activity: oral L-fuc increases
fucosylation of the tumor-expressed MHC-II protein HLA-DRB1, promoting its cell surface accumulation and
triggering CD4+T cell-mediated increases in intratumoral immune cells and tumor suppression. Notably, oral L-
fuc alters intratumoral CD4+T cell profiles, specifically increasing cmCD4+T cell populations that are required for
tumor suppression. In eliciting these effects, when combined with the immune checkpoint blockade agent anti-
PD1, L-fuc enhances the efficacy and durability of anti-PD1-mediated tumor suppression. Our data indicate that
L-fuc stimulates potent anti-tumor immunity by increasing intratumoral cmCD4+T cell populations.
 We propose to test our hypothesis that L-fuc and fucosylation alters signaling in CD4+T cells, skewing
intratumoral subpopulations toward cmCD4+T cells and promoting durable anti-tumor immune memory
and responses. In this project, we will delineate how L-fuc alters the biology of CD4+T cells to increase the
development and expansion of cmCD4+T cells by single-cell RNA sequencing. We will further determine if L-fuc
indeed enhances immunological memory and blocks tumor recurrence in vivo."
