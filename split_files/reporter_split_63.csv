Medical errors are more broadly defined as adverse clinical events that are preventable. Studies
show that medical errors remain one of the key challenges of health care and recent literature
ranks medical errors as one of the leading causes of death in the US. The urgency and the
scope of the problem prompt the development of solutions aimed to aid clinicians in reducing
such errors. Computer-based monitoring and alerting systems that rely on information in
electronic medical records (EMRs) play a key role in this effort. In the previous funding cycles,
our group has been developing an outlier-based model-driven alerting methodology with
significant potential to reduce medical errors. The method uses retrospective data to build
machine learning models that predict physician actions from a broad representation of patient
states. An alert is raised if a management action (or its omission) for the current patient deviates
significantly from predicted management actions for similar patients. As an example of an actual
alert generated by the system, consider a patient who has recently undergone a liver transplant
and receives tacrolimus as immunosuppressive agent. The patient suffers a complication and
undergoes corrective surgery; however, inadvertently, tacrolimus is not reordered following the
surgery. Since not receiving the expected medication represents a deviation from predicted
management practice in similar patients, it is a clinical outlier. Raising an alert to reorder the
medication is therefore appropriate. Our current alerting system is silently deployed on the
production electronic medical record system at UPMC and supports alerting in real-time.
The current proposal takes the research program in a bold new direction. Alerting models will be
enhanced using a variety of tools, including automatic evaluation of performance and the
inclusion of an adaptive ICU-specific knowledge-base in addition to multi-domain, multi-
resolution features derived from the EMR. Human experts will play a major role in determining
appropriateness and usefulness of alerts when generated in real-time, contribute to the dynamic
growth of the knowledge base, and evaluate the quality of the explanations provided for the
alerts. Finally, the alerting system will be deployed across 12 ICUs in a step-wedge clinical trial
to determine whether EHR-based alerting, when revealed to clinicians, modifies the rate and
timing of their actions. Secondary end-points will include alert performance metrics, process-
related outcomes, and patient-centered outcomes."
10915702,"Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastric function characterized by delay in gastric emptying, frequently associated
with chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, and malnutrition that
may require nutritional support. Gastroparesis has a devastating impact on quality of life and predominantly
affects younger women. In the past 5 years, the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) has
made a series of important contributions (see below) to improve our understanding of this disorder and
advancing the goals of patients, physicians and the NIH for management of gastroparesis. Yet, much remains
to be learned about its etiology, natural history, treatment strategies, and clinical course, which
is the rationale behind our response to the Continuation of the Gastroparesis Consortium. The biggest barrier
to effective therapeutic approaches to gastroparesis is our lack of knowledge about either its pathogenesis or
its pathophysiology. Further, the correlation between the major symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pain, and
current methods to measure change in gastric function (electrical, motor activity, meal emptying times) is poor
at best. Finally, we do not understand the long-term outcomes of these patients and whether outcomes differ
on the basis of etiology, symptom severity, and degree of emptying abnormalities. Consequently, our approach
to these patients is erratic and treatment has been empirical and only partially effective, if at all, in relieving the
major symptoms. The mission of the GpCRC is completely aligned with the recommendations of the National
Commission on Digestive Diseases: specifically, Research Goal 2.6 relates to gastroparesis and states:
""Understand the noxious visceral signaling causing nausea and vomiting related to gastric neuro-electrical
and/or motor dysfunction and the bi-directional brain-gut interactions. Gastroparesis provides an archetypal
disease for investigative inquiry. Chronic vomiting, a debilitating and socially isolating digestive symptom,
creates potentially life-threatening disruptions in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and compromises nutritional
status. Chronic nausea remains a significant hidden disability. Nausea and vomiting usually occur in tandem
and overlay with other Gl symptoms as well as presenting in numerous digestive diseases. More effective
treatments for nausea and vomiting would improve quality of life and physical functioning in a vast array of
illnesses. A paucity of research exists for defining peripheral noxious signaling of nausea and vomiting related
to primary Gl motor/sensory disturbances."" The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1. Complete the current
GpCRC registry (Registry Three); 2. Extend the GpCRC core lab, responsible for anatomic and related studies
on tissue samples of patients with Gp syndromes; 3. Perform pharmacologic studies on patients with Gp
syndromes.; 4. Perform a new device/pyloric intervention study protocol for patients with the Gp syndromes;
and 5. Utilize several novel approaches to some of the unmet needs in patients with gastroparesis symptoms,
which could be incorporated in new studies of the Consortium."
10915703,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the
public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes training the next generation of
neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too
difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience accessible and engaging to students and teachers,
Backyard Brains is developing SpikerBots: fun and affordable robots that look like brains and are controlled by
computer simulations of biological brains. The SpikerBots and associated software and curriculum require no
background in neuroscience or programming, and allow students to investigate meaningful questions about
mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robots’ behavior life-like, sensory-guided
and goal-directed. These brain design exercises engage students in active, project-based learning, which has
been shown to improve STEM outcomes, especially among disadvantaged students. In Phase I, we showed
that SpikerBots with camera-eyes, microphone-ears, speakers, 2-wheel drive and WiFi, controlled by spiking
neural networks simulated on laptops, enabled 295 high school students participating in a 1-week workshop to
learn neuroscience concepts, solve brain design challenges, and develop self-confidence in neuroscience. In
Phase II, we will (1) develop production-ready SpikerBot hardware that reduces costs and improves durability,
(2) design a cloud-based application for cross-platform functionality on low-cost laptops, and (3) develop a
curriculum and set of teacher onboarding materials, including recurring teacher workshops, held at 3 science
museums, on employing inquiry-based learning to teach effectively using the SpikerBot. Education researchers
at Purdue University will continue to conduct evaluation of students’ and teachers’ experiences and learning
gains. We intend to sell our neurorobots directly to customers, and through our education channel partners at a
price of $150 per robot. While the SpikerBot is designed for secondary education, primary and higher
education sectors as well as individuals and families can also benefit from the technology. Our long-term aim is
to encourage education policy makers to adopt more neuroscience science standards by demonstrating an
effective neuroscience curriculum organized around biological and computational concepts that embrace the
philosophy of the Next Generation Science Standards. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that
spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and active, project-based
learning, our SpikerBot and curriculum will improve STEM-education and inspire the next generation of
scientists, engineers and physicians."

Diabetes mellitus remains a leading cause of blindness world-wide and epidemiological data
from the World Health Organization reveal over 422 million adults live with diabetes and the rate
of disease onset continues to rise. According to the National Eye Institute 10.2 million US adults
40 years and older have diabetes mellitus, and 8.2% with vision threatening retinopathy.
Macular edema remains closely linked to loss of vision and current therapies focus on
mechanisms to prevent cytokine driven changes in vascular permeability that promote edema.
Our previous research has fundamentally contributed to understanding the molecular
mechanisms that lead to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced retinal vessel
permeability. The development of effective anti-VEGF therapies has been a welcome addition
for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, but this approach remains insufficient and new
therapies are needed. In the current application we now focus on understanding the process of
blood-retinal barrier regeneration. Research has identified a required role for norrin in formation
of the blood-retinal barrier. Here, we explore the exciting potential for norrin to restore vascular
barrier properties after VEGF-induced injury. The studies promise to shed new light on how
these two critical cytokines interact to control retinal vessel barrier properties. Further,
preliminary data reveal completely novel interactions of the norrin signaling molecule,
disheveled (DVL), binding directly to tight junction proteins. The role of these protein interactions
on norrin signaling and tight junction biology will be elucidated at a molecular level in order to
understand the mechanisms of norrin action on barrier restoration. We expect this proposal will
provide novel information on regulation of the blood-retinal barrier in health and in diabetes and
will provide a framework from which to develop potential new therapeutic options to treat
macular edema."
10916237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent disease that is associated with increased risk for incident
diabetes. Mechanisms of SDB-induced dysglycemia have not been elucidated. Hypoxemia has been implicated
as a key pathogenic factor in the development of glucose intolerance and diabetes. High altitude populations,
who experience chronic hypoxia, represent unique cohorts to study the role of nocturnal hypoxemia in the
pathogenesis of SDB-related diabetes. Our group previously demonstrated that severity of nocturnal hypoxemia,
independent of daytime oxyhemoglobin saturation, was associated with elevated hemoglobin A1c. To date, no
study has shown that targeting nocturnal hypoxemia improves glucose control.
In this application, we will investigate the hypothesis that nocturnal hypoxemia causes dynamic nocturnal glucose
elevations, that are mitigated by oxygen. We will employ continuous glucose monitoring to examine the temporal
association between glucose and oxygenation dynamics in an observational study and examine the effects of
nocturnal oxygen supplementation in a randomized cross-over study. Successful completion of this proposal will
provide mechanistic proof that nocturnal hypoxia is a reversible cause of dysglycemia in highlanders.
The applicant, Dr. Luu Pham, is a physician in Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, who seeks to
develop a research career focused on the pathogenesis of SDB-related metabolic diseases. This proposal would
allow the applicant dedicated time to conduct the outlined research project, as well as pursue didactic training in
design and conduct of clinical trials and further quantitative methods relevant to this project and future research
plans. The data generated from this research proposal will form the basis for an R01 application to examine the
impact of treating of hypoxemia in the pathogenesis diabetes. The career development plan for this applicant
includes a structured approach to mentoring, didactic coursework focused on a specific research goal,
participation in local and national meetings and identification and regular assessment of career milestones.
The research environment provided by Johns Hopkins University as well as the mentorship team described in
this application will assist in Dr. Pham’s successful completion of his career and research goals. The Division of
Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Johns Hopkins University have a long history of training successful
young clinical researchers. The pre-existing high-altitude research infrastructure and trained field staff, as well
as the applicant’s established and ongoing collaboration with his team of mentors, will ensure that the study
goals will be completed within the timeframe of this award. We have assembled a mentoring team of established
faculty with distinct, complementary strengths in high altitude research, clinical trials, metabolic sequelae of SDB
and biostatistics, relevant to this proposal. In addition, each member of the mentoring committee serves as an
excellent role model for the applicant’s career development into an independent investigator."
10916238,"Project Summary / Abstract
An estimated 100,000 patients are diagnosed with primary liver or pancreatic cancer per year with an even larger
number of patients will developing liver metastasis. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these patients are not
candidates for surgical resection, which is the only reliably curative treatment, yielding a five year survival rate
of approximately between 10 and 20% for patients with primary disease. The clinical challenge is that most
tumors form deep within organs, near major blood vessels, bile ducts, or nerves which complicate surgical
removal. Algorithmically Controlled Electroporation (ACE) is a new minimally invasive technique invented by the
PI for the treatment of inoperable tumors. This treatment uses brief electrical pulses to destabilize the cell
membrane and induce a tunable combination of necrotic and apoptotic cell death. We have validated the anti-
cancer efficacy of ACE against in vitro models, small animal tumor models, and in over 80 veterinary clinical
cases. In this Academic-Industrial Partnership proposal we will transition this validated technology from bench
to bedside through the development of a clinical instrument and matching disposable applicators. This
instrumentation will be validated in a porcine liver model to generate data necessary for 510(k) regulatory
submissions. The anti-tumor efficacy of the new system will then be demonstrated in a cohort of 22 canine liver
cancer patients admitted to the NCSU College of Veterinary Medicine. Data from this study will support premarket
approval (PMA) regulatory submissions targeting an oncology indication and provide the necessary data to justify
human clinical trials. To accomplish these goals we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of biomedical
engineers, immunologists, veterinarians, hepatobiliary pathologists, and interventional oncologists. Development
work for the clinical system and the disposable applicators will be completed by two industrial partners: Gradient
Medical Inc. and Nocturnal Product Development LLC. These partners have extensive experience in the
development of pulsed electric field devices, commercialization of Class I, II, & III medical devices, quality
systems management (GMP/GLP) as well as CE, 510(k), and PMA regulatory submissions. The proposed work
will result in the development of a complete medical device suitable for clinical trials and commercialization along
with the data necessary to support submission of FDA regulatory filings. This work will be accomplished via four
specific aims: (1) Characterization of Metrics for Real Time Treatment Monitoring, (2) Design and Validate
Clinical ACE Pulse Generation System Suitable for Regulatory Evaluation, (3) Characterization of ACE
Treatments In a Large Animal Clinical Model, (4) Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of ACE Against Spontaneous
Canine Hepatocellular Carcinoma."

Data Analysis Core
Synthesis of the Multimodality High Resolution 3-D Atlas of Human Lung
The Data Analysis Core (DAC) is responsible for all aspects of data and metadata management, processing,
analysis, mapping, and sharing for this Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) and of the Organ Specific Project focused
on the adult healthy human lung (i.e., Lung Specific Project or LSP). We will take a long view of an Atlas, as a
collection of 2D and 3D maps containing images, tabular data, facts about multiple locations at varying resolution
and indexes of named objects keyed to coordinates of a locational grid analogous to latitude and longitude, to
cartographically present the whole range of salient features of the human Lung. The DAC will support the TMC
in these activities by providing a protected environment for data storage and computation, and by developing
robust reproducible, reusable, and scalable computational workflows thus enabling the integration of data types
into 3D maps for the purpose of creating an interactive and queryable biomolecular human atlas. The DAC is an
essential part of the TMC in its objectives to produce and deliver to the HIVE extensive sets of high-resolution
spatial mappings of molecular entities, using open formats, and within the context of the cellular and extracellular
organization of the Lung. The DAC will accomplish its role through the following Specific Aims: 1) Ingest and
process TMC datasets, 2) Analyze datasets in support of generating multiscale, multiparameter lung tissue
maps, tabular data, and annotations, 3) Construct 2D and 3D lung tissue maps with integrated datasets and 4)
Coordinate planning and atlas production with the HuBMAP Consortium."

The CF RTCC Pilot and Feasibility Program proposes overseeing and funding pilot projects. The first specific
aim is to select two P&F grants. We will utilize a process that includes: 1) an “early” (six months prior to
submission date) and widely disseminated Pilot & Feasibility Program announcement (on the UNC CF
Center/CGIBD websites, e-mail networks, and through oral disclosures at CF and CGIBD Center meetings) of
the availability of Pilot & Feasibility projects; 2) a “pre-review” of one to two page outlines of Pilot & Feasibility
Projects by the PI and Co-Directors of the CF RTCC (Boucher, Sartor, Donaldson); 3) a review (including an
NIH-type priority score) of the Pilot & Feasibility Programs by the PI, Co-Director, Internal Advisory Committee,
and at least two members of the External Advisory Committee who are experts in the area pertinent to the P&F;
and 4) a review at ten months into Yr. 1 of the progress of the Pilot & Feasibility Projects to assess the need to
fund Year 2. We have also developed a database/tracking mechanism to follow in the outlying years the success
of the P&F Program in developing the science required for successful R01 or multi-investigator grant
applications, including Program Projects. The breadth of the research areas serviced by the CF RTCC can be
seen in the synopsis of the P&F Projects that were selected for the one to two page submission format. However,
in keeping with our mission to relate airway (mucus) pathophysiology to the GI tract, both selected P&F projects
were thematically grouped. The two P&F projects selected are: 1) Discoordinate Regulation of Mucin and Fluid
Secretion in Stem Cell-Derived CF Gut Epithelia (C. Ehre, PI); 2) The Two-Gel Model Applied to Normal and CF
Gut Epithelia (V. Shenoy, PI)."
10919824,"Abstract: EVALUATION CORE
The Evaluation Core is responsible for using rigorous and transparent processes that combine the best of NIH-
managed peer review practices with well-established methods used in the medtech industry for evaluating
proposals received in response to CINTA annual solicitations. CIMIT has extensive experience with multi-
stage processes for the evaluation of applications, including for CIMIT’s NeuroTechnology Program under Dr.
Schachter’s leadership, and NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Program (RADx Tech). The number of full
applications received per solicitation for these programs has ranged from 30 to over 700. CINTA’s overarching
goal is to support innovations that have the greatest probability of commercial success to solve significant
unmet needs for persons with nervous system disorders. Instead of the typical grant review process that
selects projects based only on what the applicant puts into their applications (“evaluate and select”), the
Evaluation Core will use a multi-stage review process to “assess, improve, select, and facilitate” subprojects.
This follows the “funnel” approach of industry and RADx Tech to winnow down proposals through staged
evaluations to those judged to have the greatest likelihood of success. The Evaluation Core will adapt and
improve CIMIT’s evaluation processes including experts with broad competencies in neurotechnologies and
disorders of the nervous system and patients and family members with personal experiences. The Core will
manage the application evaluation process with a Triage Panel, Viability Panel, Deep Dive teams, and a Deep
Dive Panel. Recommendations from each stage will be presented to the CINTA Coordination Team, then the
Steering Panel and then to NIH leadership for approval. These stages include: 1) pre-proposal screening by a
Triage Panel to determine if the proposal is responsive to the CINTA solicitation and within scope for Blueprint
MedTech, 2) review of invited full proposals by a Viability Panel to determine whether the application
addresses a clear unmet need of interest to the NIH Participating Organizations and has the potential to reach
a human-grade prototype with CINTA support, 3) A Deep Dive Team consisting of experienced mentors and
expert facilitators to work with assigned project teams over 1-3 weeks and conduct due diligence to uncover
project risks and create a project roadmap with realistic funding requirements and timelines. The end-result is
creation of milestone-driven budgets and Go/No-go decision points for the Innovator Subprojects Core to
monitor and determine whether a subproject should continue with CINTA support or be terminated, and 4)
review by the Deep Dive Panel for innovativeness, potential impact on identified unmet needs, team
capabilities, and whether a human-grade prototype can likely be achieved within the proposed timeline and
budget, and how the solution will address the needs of underserved communities. The Panel can recommend
approval for funding, rejection, or continuation of the deep dive."
10922102,"This supplement application proposes to address gaps in our understanding of rare cancers in
underrepresented individuals. This proposal is related to the work conducted in the parent grant R01-
CA264248, which was designed to develop innovative patient-derived organoid (PDOs) models of rare
cancers, neuroendocrine tumors known as pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). In
these tumors progress has lagged due to a dearth of experimental model systems. By generating novel
PDOs we aim to address two gaps in PPGLs: 1) early recognition of aggressive disease, and 2)
identification of effective treatments. Recent studies have suggested that ethnicity may contribute both
to the mutation profile and overall survival of PPGL patients. Certain socioeconomic indicators that can
impact on disease features and outcomes can co-associate in underrepresented populations. In this
supplement, we will leverage our expertise in generating and evaluating PDOs to establish models from
underrepresented racial/ethnic minority patients diagnosed with PPGLs, as well as patients with
aggressive forms of PPGLs. We propose to define the patients’ genetic admixture, and evaluate clinical,
standardized social determinants of health and how they associate with biomarkers of tumor behavior,
genetic selection, and drug response detected in PDOs. To achieve our goals, and recruit this patient
population, we will expand our team to include two collaborators with expertise in cancer disparities and
clinical care of patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Our studies may provide insights into PPGL
biology, the prevalence of clinically actionable alterations and potential drug selection for treatment in
PDOs from underrepresented patients which can be incorporated onto the design of future studies that
address disparities in rare tumors."
10910579,"ABSTRACT
With escalating challenges of climate change and social inequality, there is an urgent need for tools that can
monitor the influences of the exposome on human health across large populations. Due to the heterogeneity and
complexity of biological responses in the body, the capacity to obtain organ-level insights from a simple blood
draw is much desired.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayer membrane structures of diameters 30 – 1000 nm, and they are released
into the bloodstream by cells throughout the body, at concentrations on the order of 1010 per ml. Their molecular
content of proteins, dsDNA oligomers, microRNAs, mRNAs, and other analytes, may play multiple functional
roles via EV trafficking, and may also provide a diagnostic report back on the tissue of origin. As such, EVs
provide a unique opportunity to study the health impact of environmental exposures through blood analyses.
The long-term goal of this proposed program is to conduct population-level exposomic surveillance through the
development of a minimally invasive method that can provide a systems view of health status. The method will
be capable of monitoring tissue-specific signatures across individual organs and organ systems through
measurements of circulating EVs. The overall objective of this project is to develop, validate, and apply the
analytical infrastructures (technologies, software, and resources) that powers the method, focusing on
investigating the environmental impact on the human lungs as a proof-of-concept. To establish the technological
foundation of this project, we will integrate an exciting technology trio collectively termed the Extracellular Vesicle
Tricorder. The first technology, VET-seq (Vesicle Epitope Transcript Sequencing), is a droplet-based sequencing
method that resolves the organ source of circulating EVs by detecting EV proteins and RNA cargoes
simultaneously at single-vesicle resolution. The second technology, OrganView, aims to sort and assemble
scrappy information carried by EVs into meaningful biological messages with organ specificity. The third
technology, VPU (Vesicle Processing Unit), integrates a sensitive nanoparticle method, digital microfluidics, and
on-chip immunoassay, to facilitate population-level analysis of EVs.
Towards these challenging goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary research team to bring together
complementary expertise in micro-nanotechnologies, molecular epidemiology, EV biology, bioinformatics and
statistical modeling, lung cancer, and infectious diseases.
The proposed research is highly innovative because it harnesses an emerging class of analytes (EV omics) to
develop an unconventional systems approach for monitoring the influence of environmental exposures on human
health. Overall, the new concepts, technologies, and resources derived from this work will augment current
methods for exposome research, with the potential to deepen our understanding of human exposome and reveal
unknown health threats in our environment."
10910581,"Adaptive immunity is one of the most complex and clinically relevant aspects of human biology, where immune
cells have evolved over millions of years to discriminate non-self from self, and the dangerous from the
innocuous. Though cancer cells pose an intrinsic danger to an organism, their derivation from self enables them
to evade immune recognition. Nevertheless, an increased understanding of interactions between immune cells
and cancer cells has culminated in extraordinary cures in refractory cancers by harnessing the immune response.
However, the success of these therapies remains relegated to subsets of cancers (mostly leukemias and high
mutational tumors), owing largely to a lack of highly specific immunotherapy targets in the majority of cancers.
In my previous work, I developed new methods to identify novel tumor antigens and engineer a new class of
chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T cells called peptide-centric (PC)-CAR T cell, which are capable of targeting
low mutational solid tumors. These PC-CAR T cells completely eradicate highly aggressive tumors in all
relevant preclinical models and are entering clinical trials in 2024. The process that I developed for generating
PC-CARs provides a roadmap that can be applied to all tumor types, significantly expanding the population of
patients that are eligible for CAR therapies (Yarmarkovich et al., Nature 2021). Having pioneered the first-
generation of PC-CARs, I am uniquely familiar with the challenges of the process and have carefully devised
strategies to improve this process such as to develop safer and more effective immunotherapies. The work
described in my DP2 is focused on developing new technologies that address two major bottle-necks in the
current CAR development process, identifying tumor-specific antigens and engineering antigen-specific
receptors. To identify tumor-specific targets, I describe a comprehensive immunoproteomic search tool that I
expect will uncover targets in any given tumor. I also propose new strategies for identifying logic-gated CAR
targets and methods to streamline their screening in a high-throughput manner. To generate safer and more
effective PC-CAR receptors, I describe new library systems that allows for screening of CAR T cells at an
unprecedented scale, enabling the efficient generation of 104 antigen-specific CAR clones and a system to screen
them in the most relevant contexts. I also describe an entirely new approach for developing CAR T cells through
“reverse engineering” the immune response from patients who have been cured of cancer using immune
checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, I describe new computational methods for de novo engineering of PC-CAR
receptors and in silico cross-reactivity screening that have the potential to dramatically scale PC-CAR
development. This multi-pronged strategy describes several new approaches, each of which can transform
the development of immunotherapies and benefit a large population of cancer patients if successful. In
alignment with the NIH Director's New Innovator Award, this work directly builds on my previous experiences
and describes high-risk, high-reward research that has significant potential to impact the lives of cancer patients."
10910639,"Developing a CRISPR-free mammalian recombineering system
Project Summary / Abstract
The ability to manipulate large segments of DNA in mammalian cells is essential for research and therapeutics.
However, current programmable genome editing methods for creating kilobase-scale DNA manipulations
require cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) or cannot create all required manipulations1. To address this
major challenge, my laboratory at Scripps Research is developing a platform for mammalian recombineering
that enables programmable large DNA insertions, deletions, and substitutions without the introduction of DSBs
or DNA scars. Our preliminary data demonstrates that bacterial recombinases such as RecT from
Enterococcus faecium2 are sufficient to catalyze whole gene insertion in the human genome. In this proposal, I
describe the further characterization, optimization, and application of this system. First, we will fully
characterize the mechanism and capabilities of efmRecT to create different size insertions, deletions, and
substitutions across the genome using multiple methods of detection. Then we will engineer our
recombineering system using supplemental bacterial recombineering proteins, mammalian repair protein
inhibitors, and other manipulations informed by our mechanistic studies. We also aim to improve the efficiency
of efmRecT through directed evolution in bacteria and/or mammalian cells. Finally, we will demonstrate the
utility of our developed system by applying it to cell models of Gaucher Disease. The small size of RecT
enables facile biomolecule delivery as the RecT gene, homology donor, and regulatory sequences can be
encoded on a single recombinant AAV genome. As such, I am proposing an “all-in-one” AAV therapeutic
where a single recombinant AAV can correct any of the hundreds of mutations associated with Gaucher
Disease. If developed into a functional system for efficient genome editing, this method has the potential to
impact fields spanning research to the clinic, including genomic perturbations of complex cell lines and
organisms, methods for mammalian synthetic biology, and therapeutics."
10909989,"The Next-Gen Oncopathology (NGO) program has the overall mission of training young diagnosticians to meet
advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis and new oncological interventional
approaches thereby leading the field of pathology into the future. Specialized pathologists have been involved
in cancer diagnostics by examining tissues and other specimens since at least the 19th century, and training in
pathology has been incrementally structured and subspecialized. Pathology training programs traditionally teach
residents to examine tissue under the microscope and analyze laboratory data for diagnosis, with pathology
research being largely descriptive. This approach is no longer sufficient, and it is essential that we prepare
pathologists to understand and apply advanced technologies to perform more precise and personalized
diagnostics in addition to utilizing innovative and improved ways to conduct research and diagnose cancer. The
Weill Cornell Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine has trained numerous outstanding pathologists
in many subspecialty areas, but it is only with the use of an innovative approach incorporating a view towards
the future that we will be able to produce leaders that will advance the field of cancer pathology. The NGO
program takes a holistic and multidisciplinary approach, where all aspects of a cancer patient are considered,
ranging from the tumors themselves, to in vitro and in vivo cancer models, to changes in the patients’ blood and
microbial infections. Thus, trainees in both Anatomic and Clinical Pathology (i.e. Laboratory Medicine) will be
included, which will be individuals with MD or MD/PhD degrees doing a Pathology Residency or Fellowship, or
trainees with PhD degrees doing a clinical fellowship in Laboratory Medicine, who are committed to an academic
career that includes cancer research. Our trainees will gain expertise and depth by spending two years in a
research laboratory working in one or more of the following major themes: 1) molecular diagnosis and cellular
therapies, 2) cancer pathobiology, 3) advanced imaging and 4) tumor microenvironment. The foundational
principles of the NGO program will be to ensure that all the pathology projects relate to the study of cancer
patient samples as well as the comparative pathology of cancer models. Overarching methodologies that will
support all of the projects are: i) biostatistics and data science, ii) machine learning and artificial intelligence, and
iii) genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Faculty in the program have expertise in the major
themes and specific methodologies, which will allow for the teaching of foundational skills as well as a highly
customized educational plan. This will be accomplished by the establishment of a mandatory NGO Course as
well as additional course requirements on data science and career development, which will allow trainees
flexibility to design a personalized curriculum with their mentoring committee. We will also leverage the Meyer
Cancer Center and the Weill Cornell Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) resources to educate the
next generation of pathologists working on cancer."
10909991,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cognitive impairment is prevalent in older adults and females carry a disproportionately greater risk for
cognitive deficits like dementia and Alzheimer's disease. While estrogen deficiencies have been linked to an
increased risk of cognitive decline, the mechanism for this remains unclear. Evidence suggests that women
living with HIV (WLH) are more likely to experience an earlier onset of menopause, thereby reducing the
circulating estrogen levels. Additionally, within the population of people living with HIV (PLWH), women are at a
higher risk for developing cognitive decline which tracks with data seen in the general population of people
living without HIV. Thanks to the advancement of HIV treatments, PLWH are living longer, adding to the
urgency to identify mechanisms underlying the acceleration of cognitive decline. The goal of this proposal is to
determine the extent to which estrogen receptor expression and function predict cognitive decline in WLH.
Leveraging the framework of the Atlanta Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort and the Emory
SCORE U54, this project will test the hypothesis that HIV serostatus interacts with menopause to alter
estrogen receptor subtype expression and that changes to estrogen receptor β are predictive of inflammatory
and cognitive outcomes. Aim 1 will focus on the characterization of estrogen receptor subtype protein
expression in PBMCs to establish a metric for understanding the expression of the two prominent estrogen
receptor subtypes (α and β) and how they differ in the context of menopause and HIV. Aim 2 will establish
inflammatory and cognitive profiles for the study participants using longitudinal timepoints to illuminate changes
in both inflammatory and cognitive states that can be tracked over time. Data resulting from the evaluation of
estrogen receptor subtype expression in the context of menopausal status and HIV status, coupled with the
cognitive data available through WIHS will enrich our understanding of the role of estrogen receptors in
predicting cognitive decline, and potentially inform biomarker selection for screening women who are at higher
risk of developing cognitive impairment, especially WLH. This research and training will be performed with Dr.
Gretchen N. Neigh, Ph.D., at Virginia Commonwealth University. The training provided will build upon the
applicant's technical, computational, and molecular skills, in addition to providing targeted professional
development opportunities, and further training in hypothesis-driven project design. Ultimately, this training will
prepare the applicant for a future as an independent physician-scientist, investigating factors that impact
cognition with aging."

wall magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the intracranial vasculature is increasingly in demand to diagnose
such ESUS patients so that appropriate treatment can be administered. Multi-contrast intracranial vessel wall
(IVW) MRI with efficient analysis is currently recommended by the American Society of Neuroradiology to
diagnose various vessel wall pathologies including ICAD. While this urgent need for IVW has stimulated
availability of 3D spin echo sequences on major scanner platforms (VISTA on Philips, SPACE on Siemens and
CUBE on GE), there are no efficient and effective methods for clinicians to analyze the multi-contrast IVW MRI
sequences that can be obtained on modern clinical MRI scanners. Quantitative measurements of the vessel wall
across scanner platforms are also required to enable multi-center studies for ICAD assessment in ESUS.
Variability in sequence implementation affects multi-center studies on multiple scanner platforms and must be
overcome to enable robust IVW measurements. Therefore, we propose to develop an automated IVW analysis
pipeline for multi-contrast multi-platform application using a domain adaptive and deep learning approach. We
have pioneered multiple semiautomatic approaches (3D-registration, artery tracing, artery labeling, multi-planar
reformatting, vessel wall segmentation, multi-contrast feature identification) towards vessel wall quantification.
Leveraging this expertise, we will develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) empowered multiplanar viewing for
artery characterization (AI-MOCHA) pipeline as follows: In Aim 1 we will construct the MOCHA pipeline and train
AI-MOCHA using transfer learning from labeled IVW images and test AI-MOCHA against radiologist labeled IVW
from ICAD patients. We will also test whether AI-MOCHA improves the inter-scan and inter-reader reproducibility
of IVW image analysis. In Aim 2 we will develop domain adaptation to overcome scanner-platform differences in
IVW images and develop a Domain Adaptive AI-MOCHA. We will then show that domain adaptive AI-MOCHA
improves the inter-scan and inter-reader reproducibility of IVW image analysis over AI-MOCHA. In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that non-stenotic ICAD is more frequently detected by AI-MOCHA in the vascular territory of
ESUS than in other territories using Domain Adaptive AI-MOCHA. To achieve this, we will scan 65 ESUS
subjects each on the Philips, Siemens and GE 3T scanner platforms in a multi-center setting (three different
hospitals) and demonstrate the utility of domain adaptive AI-MOCHA for robust and efficient IVW analysis. In
doing so, we will not only establish the importance of non-stenotic ICAD in ESUS but also develop a clinically
applicable IVW analysis pipeline for monitoring ICAD progression that will assist in optimizing medical therapies
in individual patients. Further, the pipeline will provide a rapid, reliable tool for identifying patients who do not
respond to conventional therapies for clinical trial participation."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most deadly primary malignant brain tumor. Calcium signaling
regulates a plethora of cancer-associated molecular and cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis,
motility, angiogenesis, differentiation, gene transcription as well as neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.
Calcium influx from the extracellular space to the cytosol is regulated by T-Type calcium channels (TTCC). Our
preliminary data show that TTCC are upregulated in GBM cells, stem cells (GSC) and human tumors and that
their blockage leads to inhibition of cancer-promoting parameters in tumor cell-intrinsic and
microenvironment-dependent manners. Based on these data, we hypothesize that TTCC strongly regulate
GBM molecular events and GBM-microenvironment interactions to drive tumor growth, and that
targeting TTCC in combination with other modalities is a promising GBM therapy. To test this hypothesis,
we propose to investigate the tumor cell-intrinsic and microenvironment-dependent functions, mechanisms of
action, and therapeutic targeting of TTCC in GBM. In Aim 1, we will determine the GBM cell-intrinsic role
and mechanisms of action of TTCC in new mouse models with intact microenvironment. We will develop
new RCAS/Tva and transgenic immune competent TTCC mouse models and use them to study the role of TTCC
in an intact GBM microenvironment. We will also use genomic and proteomic screenings and molecular and
functional approaches to uncover the mechanisms of action of TTCC in these GBM tumors. In Aim 2, we will
uncover the role of tumor microenvironment TTCC in mediating tumor-promoting neuron/GBM
interactions. We hypothesize that neuronal TTCC and GBM TTCC cooperate to regulate the tumor-promoting
interactions between GBM cells and neurons that were recently discovered. To test this hypothesis, we will use
co-cultures and GBM animal models to investigate the role of TTCC in regulating neuron/GBM synaptic
formation, calcium influx into tumor cells, and tumor growth and malignancy. In Aim 3, we will develop and test
new strategies for the therapeutic targeting of TTCC in GBM. We have a repurposed FDA approved TTCC
blocker, mibefradil, that was demonstrated to be safe and possibly effective in a phase I recurrent GBM trial. We
will test the effects of mibefradil on the growth of GBM xenografts, syngeneic tumors and RCAS/Tva GBM mice
using the standard clinical Stupp Regimen. We will also perform in vitro and in vivo synthetic lethal CRISPR
screens to uncover druggable targets and drugs that synergize with mibefradil. We will then test combinations
of mibefradil and the synthetic lethal drugs in GBM animal models. Altogether, the findings will generate new
knowledge on the functions and mechanisms of action of TTCC in GBM and its microenvironment, develop new
tools for the study of TTCC, uncover the role of TTCC in mediating tumor-promoting neuron/GBM interactions,
and develop and test new efficacious GBM combination therapies that could be translated into clinical trials."

Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder that imposes a significant burden on
public health. The most recent large-scale genetic study of BP identified 64 associated genetic loci, providing
initial insights in BP pathogenesis. Yet, genetic discovery in BP lags behind other key psychiatric disorders. The
reported genetic loci only capture a small proportion of the total BP genetic liability, with many more variants
across the common and rare allele frequency spectrum remaining to be discovered. In addition, the previous
studied samples were of European ancestry, leaving population specific BP variants uncovered and uncertainty
in how the BP genetic findings generalize to other populations, exacerbating health disparities, and these studies
rarely employed “deep” phenotyping or assessed relevant environmental risk factors. This proposal brings
together an international collaboration of leading investigators from the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore,
India, and Pakistan to form the Asian Bipolar Genetics Network (A-BIG-NET) and carry out a large-scale genetic
study of BP in East and South Asia. A-BIG-NET will generate a BP genetic resource of 27,500 cases and 16,000
controls with rich phenotypic information, measures of key environmental stressors and genetic data from 4x
low-pass whole genome sequencing (4xWGS). This will complement a schizophrenia genetics resource of
22,778 cases and 35,362 controls of Asian ancestry previously assembled by leaders of this network that will be
available for cross-disorder comparisons. Studying BP genetics in Asia is important to the world and the U.S.,
as Asia constitutes 57% of the world population, and Asian American comprises 6.6% of the U.S. population
(21.4 million). The five countries in A-BIG-NET cover 47% of all Asian populations. The specific aims of the
proposal are to: 1) recruit and deeply phenotype 17,500 BP cases, with a focus on BP-I to maximize homogeneity,
and 14,000 controls from four Asian countries; 2) carry out 4xWGS on all recruited samples plus 10,000 BP-I
cases and 2,000 controls collected by a previous study using similar procedures in Pakistan; and 3) carry out a
range of analyses to discover new genetic associations with BP-I across the allelic spectrum in East and South
Asian populations, examine the comparative genetic architecture of BP-I across major world populations and
with other major neuropsychiatric disorders, and perform a novel statistical fine-mapping analysis that leverages
the multi-ancestry genomic diversity and pleiotropy across psychiatric disorders to identify putative causal
variants. Aim 3 will also explore the genetic “validity” of various BP-I subtypes and fit models with joint genetic
and environmental risk factors. This proposal will dramatically increase the worldwide diversity of genetics data
on BP, an important step to accelerate gene discovery in this disorder and advance global mental health equity."
10929519,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that results in cognitive decline. The
neuroinflammatory events that are associated with the pathology of AD exacerbate neurodegeneration. Elderly
people with dementia or AD have a higher risk of falling because their cognitive function is affected. They lose
their orientation and are very prone to breaking their hips, other bones, or even more severe falls that can cause
brain trauma. Although they are treated in the hospitals with subsequent rehabilitation, their weakened immune
state typically affects their recovery phases. We need to develop new treatments for AD patients who have had
a traumatic brain injury (TBI). This vulnerable population could be particularly amenable to precision-microbiota
therapy. Although not fully understood, the brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a major role in the onset and severity
of many neurological diseases. We plan to develop precision-microbiota therapy to protect against
neurodegeneration and functional behavior in AD mice after TBI. The gut microbiome is emerging as an essential
neuromodulator of brain-gut axis signaling. It can significantly impact brain inflammation and outcome after CNS
trauma and alter anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. This research proposal is based on the scientific
premise that gut bacteria can impact behavior and that brain injury can disrupt diversity in a healthy gut
microbiome. The overarching hypothesis is that the gut microbiota dysfunction caused by brain trauma
contributes directly to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration responses in AD mice, and the microbiota
modulation will delay the progression of AD neuropathology. Our preliminary data indicate how the microbiota of
AD mice affected adversely to TBI outcomes and how probiotics help brain recovery in C57B6/J young mice.
This proposal investigates the mechanistic linkage between gut microbiota and AD progression following TBI
and explores potential intervention strategies. We will test this premise with the following three Specific Aims:
we 1) will determine if the gut microbiome plays a role in accelerating AD pathology and cognitive decline induced
by TBI, and 2) will investigate the impact of fecal transplants on AD pathology and cognitive decline after TBI,
and 3) will assess the ability of multi-strain probiotics to reduce AD pathology after TBI. We expect to identify a
particularly vulnerable patient population by defining which inflammatory responses associated with brain trauma
accelerate AD pathogenesis and are regulated by brain-gut-microbiome signals. Our approach is significant
because we will establish a “translatable” foundation for the potential of therapeutic approaches for AD after TBI
by using the gut as a non-CNS target of precision-microbiota therapy."

The objective of this proposal is to develop a new point-of-care test (POCT)—the D4 assay—for early field-
detection of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Currently, EBOV is diagnosed by RNA detection using reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR requires a makeshift BSL-4 grade laboratory in the
field, expensive equipment, and highly trained personnel. Other POCTs, including the user-friendly lateral-flow
assay (LFA), lack the sensitivity for early detection that is critical for timely intervention with the available
antibody cocktail that yields 90% survival rates for patients with low viremia. Our objective is motivated by an
urgent clinical need for a POCT that (1) detects EBOV infection in the field quickly and reliably, (2) requires little
on-field infrastructure, (3) yields results in 30 min, and (4) matches or exceeds the performance of RT-PCR. To
achieve these goals, we have designed an integrated POCT the D4 assay that has four simple steps—dispense,
dissolve, diffuse, and detect that require limited handling and skill to perform. This new-frontier technology takes
advantage of the presence of an unmistakable, viral secreted glycoprotein sGP that is present in the serum of
infected patients very early in infection. We have generated customized monoclonal antibodies (Abs) for sGP to
use in the D4 assay. The current prototype D4 assay that we have designed detects EBOV infection at least one
day earlier than RT-PCR in infected monkeys and at a far lower cost than RT-PCR or LFA. In this proposal,
we plan to advance our development and improve the sensitivity of the D4 assay further as well as reduce the
assay time from 60 min to 30 min. Our strategy is to increase the equilibrium binding constant of our current Ab
pair from ~10-9 M to ~10-11 M with antibody affinity maturation techniques and high-throughput screening of
antibody pairs. The enhanced D4 assay kit will have inkjet-printed capture and detection antibodies on a protein
and cell-resistant polymer brush on a glass plate encased in a passive capillarity microfluidics chip. The assay
output will be fluorescence of microspots on the D4 chip. We have developed a portable handheld fluorescence
detector to capture and image the spots and automatically convert them into the concentration of analytes for
quantitation and uploaded to a secure server. The design will be rigorously tested and validated with samples
from infected human cells and laboratory-challenged non-human primates. At the completion of this project, we
will have a field-ready, user-friendly, and highly sensitive POCT that will allow healthcare workers to detect EBOV
in serum, blood, or other bodily fluids in 30 min. The new design will push the current boundaries of EBOV
detection and facilitate more expedient deployment of infection control and patient support measures that can
yield 90% survival rates or better if implemented early in infection. Because the D4 POCT is multiplexable, it will
set a precedent for broader utility beyond EBOV to diagnose many other infectious diseases."

Nearly all pediatric and young adult (PYA) kidney transplants fail within 10-15 years, significantly reducing life
expectancy for young people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pediatric kidney transplant recipients face
distinct barriers to allograft survival, including diagnostic and prognostic tools that are inadequate and not tailored
for children. Consequently, kidney transplant injury regularly escapes detection until substantial damage has
occurred that hastens allograft failure. Surveillance biopsies allow for earlier detection of subclinical injury prior
to transplant dysfunction, but we have shown that the presence of subclinical phenotypes are still predictive of
transplant failure. Improved methods of detecting clinical and subclinical kidney transplant endpoints are needed
to increase longevity of youth with ESRD. Recent studies have validated patterns of gene expression (e.g.,
molecular biomarkers) in adult kidney transplant biopsies with greater diagnostic precision than conventional
histology. Similar advances with molecular biomarkers have not been translated to children. The objective of this
proposal is address this unmet clinical need by identifying and validating molecular biomarkers of key outcomes
in young kidney transplant recipients. We will integrate clinical features, traditional histology, and molecular
biomarkers to create powerful tools for precision diagnosis and prediction of long-term outcomes that are tailored
for PYA kidney transplants. Our central hypothesis is that distinctive gene expression patterns in kidney biopsies
will predict clinical and subclinical events in young transplant recipients and expand the capabilities of traditional
histology. The central hypothesis was formulated by our preliminary data in which we identified molecular
biomarkers of WNT pathway activation as novel predictors of kidney transplant injury and subsequent allograft
failure, even in individuals with reassuring clinical features and normal traditional histology. We will test the
central hypothesis by using the NanoString platform to interrogate archived PYA kidney transplant biopsies in
pursuit of three specific aims. In aim 1, we will identify molecular biomarkers of clinical endpoints in PYA kidney
transplantation. We expect that PYA-specific molecular biomarkers will: a) have excellent diagnostic
performance for clinical endpoints, b) help discriminate cases with diagnostic uncertainty by traditional histology,
and c) outperform conventional clinical features and histology for predicting long-term outcomes in youth. In aim
2, we will discern the role of subclinical molecular phenotypes in PYA kidney transplantation. We expect to find
unique molecular biomarkers of subclinical endpoints that will outperform conventional histology in predicting
future rejection episodes and allograft failure. In aim 3, we will validate clinical and molecular biomarkers as
predictors of kidney transplant outcomes in a prospective biorepository cohort of PYA kidney transplants.
Collectively, this project will externally validate PYA-specific covariate-adjusted molecular biomarkers as
comprehensive clinical prediction tools that are ready for use in future studies of PYA kidney transplants."
10911853,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The expanding visceral fat depots (VAT) of overweight and obese individuals experience dysfunction of the
microcirculation with hypoxia and abnormal infiltration of leukocytes. Infiltrating immune cells and hypoxic
adipocytes cause a systemic low-grade inflammation that is considered now causative of cardiovascular disease
and metabolic disorders. Thus, the incidence of cardiometabolic disorders (hypertension, kidney disease, and
insulin resistance) are becoming epidemic in the ever-growing overweight population of the USA. The precise
mechanisms by which weight gain alters microvascular responses in VAT remain poorly understood.
Furthermore, it has not been determined whether impaired microvascular responses of VAT are the initiating
cause of cardiometabolic dysfunction and disease. We have identified a novel adipokine, IL-19, expressed in the
adipose tissue of humans and mice. IL-19 is a newly discovered Th2-interleukin which has been recently
studied for its protective vascular effects in the setting of large vessels disease, such as atherosclerosis and
ischemia reperfusion injury. Preliminary data obtained in the Co-PI's laboratories strongly suggest that IL-19
regulate the homeostasis of adipose tissue microcirculation in diet-induced obesity. Accordingly, the
overarching hypothesis of this dual-investigator application is that IL-19 is a unique interleukin
that maintains cardiometabolic homeostasis by controlling angiogenesis and inflammatory
responses in VAT depots. The long-term goals of this project are: 1) to understand the mechanisms
through which IL-19 regulates vascularity and inflammation in VAT; and 2) to mechanistically correlate these
microvascular actions of IL-19 to whole-body insulin signaling. Toward these goals, we will utilize knockout
and transgenic mouse technology along with physiological, cellular, molecular, and biochemical techniques.
We anticipate that the results of this work will advance our understanding of the integrated mechanisms that
initiate and maintain VAT dysfunction and related cardiometabolic disorders in the overweight/obese
organism."

10913541,"Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the
breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of
individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and
conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share
data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key
first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in
functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive
information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional
genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will
approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to
quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks
can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural
variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices.
Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional
genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence
alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression
quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the
sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and
isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the
reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use
inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the
microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification
accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive
information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects,
such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue
Expression projects."

Increased access to cesarean sections (c-sections) has contributed to the decline of maternal mortality in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA); however, as the rate of c-sections has increased, so has the rate of c-section related
complications. While women who deliver vaginally in rural SSA often receive postpartum follow-up care in their
homes from community health workers (CHWs), most programs require that women who deliver via c-section
return to health centers or hospitals for follow-up because of the increased complexity of their care. Facility-
based follow-up can be financially catastrophic and physically burdensome for mothers, leading to delays in care
and increased risk for morbidity.
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a safe mobile health (mHealth) tool to support CHW-led home-
based follow-up for women delivering via c-section in rural Rwanda at postoperative days (PODs) 5 and 10. In
the first R21 phase, we will develop a software library for an existing photo-based surgical site infection (SSI)
diagnostic algorithm to run locally on a smartphone (without internet or cell network connection) (Aim 1a). We
will work with Insightiv Technologies to develop the comprehensive mHealth-CHW tool, including incorporating
the SSI diagnostic algorithm software library and integrating three CHW usability assessments into the design
phase (Aim 1b). Finally, we will test the usability and acceptability of the new tool in a group of 30 CHWs (Aim
2). When we achieve 80% usability and acceptability, we will continue to the second phase.
The R33 phase of the grant will study the validity of the mHealth-CHW tool for c-section follow-up (Aim 3) by
prospectively following 450 women delivering via c-section and implementing the mHealth-CHW tool and follow-
up in their homes at PODs 5 and 10. The women will then return to the hospital at POD 16 for a physical
examination and we will compare diagnoses and complications identified via the mHealth-CHW tool to those
from the physical exam. We will then evaluate the time-to-diagnosis for c-section complications by randomizing
1350 women to follow-up by the mHealth-CHW tool versus standard of care (Aim 4). Finally, we will assess the
acceptability of mHealth-CHW follow-up in 40 women who have delivered via c-section through focus group
discussions (Aim 5). We will also conduct two research training series, one in quantitative methods and one in
qualitative methods, to strengthen our team's ability to lead mHealth research in the future."

The proposed project will address a critical public health challenge: developing technology that can help the
cannabis industry, law enforcement, and regulators with addressing the growing black market for cannabis
products via online platforms. While many states have now legalized medical and recreational use of cannabis,
others continue to strictly regulate or prohibit its use. This has led to confusion and lack of policy coherence,
creating opportunities for unscrupulous providers to divert or sell unregulated, adulterated, and otherwise unsafe
cannabis products via the Internet. This issue is further complicated by new and emerging cannabis products
with unknown and questionable safety that can be marketed and sold directly to consumers on popular online
platforms, including social media, e-commerce sites, and the dark web. In response, this project will utilize
advances in big data, machine learning, and data visualization to establish a multiplatform detection and
compliance system to identify, classify, and report illegal online cannabis sales with the aim of enabling digital
prevention and harm reduction. The system will develop a digital database that cross-references state licensure
information for compliance checking and identifying specific violating online sellers to prevent customer exposure
and associated health harms. This novel approach will enable the development of a robust end-to-end automated
cannabis product online monitoring and compliance solution needed to ensure the future viability and integrity of
the legitimate U.S. cannabis market. The project has the following project aims:
Milestone 1: Establish dedicated data collection protocols for multiple social media channels, major cannabis
e-commerce platforms, and dark web marketplaces, filtered for cannabis product and consumption-related
keywords (M1: Create a multiplatform data collection system and database for cannabis products and sellers)
Milestone 2: Develop sufficient training data and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify illegal
cannabis sellers with high precision and efficiency (M2: develop a suite of algorithms and conduct model
evaluation)
Milestone 3: Build data visualization tools and compliance solutions with specific end user feedback to create a
customizable front-end, web hosted data dashboard that enables detection and automated reporting of illegal
sellers (M3: Create an MVP based on needs of customer segments and conduct business hypothesis testing)
This project will fill existing gaps in illicit cannabis research and innovation through the development of a
customizable and cost-efficient tool to improve the identification, detection, and reporting of unregulated and
illegal cannabis sales to ensure the integrity of the legal cannabis supply chain and protect consumers."

 Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. It is an emerging
field in cancer biology, and the detailed molecular regulators of ferroptosis are largely unknown. We recently
demonstrated that upregulation of metallothionein (MT)-1G expression contributes to ferroptosis resistance in
human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, whereas inhibition of MT-1G expression enhances ferroptosis sensitivity
in vitro and in vivo (Hepatology. 2016 63(1):173-184.; Hepatology. 2016 64(2):488-500.). These exciting findings
raise several important questions regarding the previously unidentified role of MT-1G in the regulation of
ferroptotic cancer cell death. Our central hypothesis is that expression and release of MT-1G limits ferroptotic
cancer cell death. To test this hypothesis, we will exploit molecular, cellular, and animal models to pursue the
following aims. Aim 1: Define the mechanism responsible for transcriptional regulation of MT-1G expression in
ferroptosis. Aim 2: Define the mechanism responsible for phosphorylation modification of MT-1G function in
ferroptosis. Aim 3: Define the mechanism responsible for extracellular activity of MT-1G in ferroptosis. The
completion of these exciting studies will improve our understanding of the cancer molecular pathobiology of
ferroptosis and guide future development of novel MT-1G-based anticancer therapeutic strategies."

Increasing the therapeutic window of radiotherapy may be achieved by using targeted therapies against cancer-
associated pathways. The complement system is an innate immunity pathway, with emerging roles in cancer
progression. No study has evaluated the effect of complement inhibition on both tumor and normal tissue
radiation response. Here we show that targeting complement receptor C5aR1 improves radiation response in
colorectal cancer models while reducing radiation-induced toxicity. Targeting C5aR1 increases IL-10 secretion,
which attenuates NF-κB signaling and enhances apoptosis in tumor cells. IL-10-dependent apoptosis is
observed both in vivo and in vitro suggesting a non-canonical stress-specific and likely immune-independent role
for C5aR1 in regulating apoptosis. Importantly, we find that C5aR1 depletion results in decreased small intestinal
histologic damage, crypt cell apoptosis and increased survival of mice following irradiation. In the small intestine,
C5aR1 depletion results in increased IL-10 expression in both non-immune and immune cell populations. IL-10
signaling in CX3CR1+ macrophages is important for intestinal injury defense and C5aR1-/- mice have significantly
higher levels of CX3CR1+ macrophages than WT mice. In response to irradiation, C5aR1 depletion does not
attenuate NF-κB signaling but instead increases AKT activation correlating with decreased apoptosis occurring
in an IL-10-depedent manner. Our data, therefore, indicate that genetically or pharmacologically targeting C5aR1
can improve radiation response in colorectal tumor models while reducing radiation-induced small bowel toxicity.
Together, these findings suggest that inhibiting complement could be a promising approach to increasing the
therapeutic window of radiotherapy. In this Project, we propose four specific aims to better understand the role
of C5aR1 in radioprotection and radiosensitization. Aim 1 will determine the broad versus specific protection of
normal epithelium (intestines, salivary glands, and lung epithelium) by C5aR1-/- mice in response fractionated
and hypofractionated radiotherapy, in collaboration with Projects 2, 3, 4 and Core B. In Aim 2, we will investigate
the mechanistic basis of radioprotection when C5aR1 is inhibited. Our preliminary data indicates that this is an
IL-10 dependent mechanism and involves recruitment of CX3CR1+ macrophages that promote survival and
angiogenesis. Aim 3 will determine how C5aR1 promotes tumor cell killing in combination with radiotherapy.
The hypothesis based on our preliminary data is that C5aR1 inhibition increases IL-10 secretion, which
attenuates NF-κB signaling, resulting in IL-10 dependent tumor cell killing both in cell culture and in animal
models. Aim 4 will determine the effect of clinical grade C5aR1 inhibitors on radioprotecting intestine, salivary
glands and lungs, and sensitizing colorectal tumors to radiotherapy. I intend to return to Stanford on a monthly
or bimonthly schedule and will share this data with my colleagues at Stanford. At Oxford, we perform our own
dosimetry and will cooperate with Core B at Stanford to ensure comparability of methods."

Hyposalivation or dry mouth is the most common complication of radiotherapy (RT) in head and neck cancer
(HNC). It adversely impacts patients’ quality of life and places them at risk for significant late morbidities. Current
strategies to mitigate hyposalivation are costly and ineffective. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which
aims to spare one parotid gland, has resulted in improved stimulatory salivary function, but it cannot spare the
submandibular glands, which are crucial for resting salivary function throughout the day, because of their location
adjacent to the draining lymph nodes. We and others have found that salivary stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs)
exist in adult glands and that injection of ~200 of these cells into irradiated murine submandibular glands (SMG)
could restore saliva function. We have also found that ALDH3A1 expression is upregulated in SSPCs, and
that activation of this enzyme with a small molecular activator before, during and after RT resulted
increased SSPC yield and preservation of saliva function after RT. Mechanistically activation of
ALDH3A1 enhanced clearance of aldehyde after RT, leading less SSPC apoptosis, resulting in functional
preservation. The use of ALHD3A1 activator did not protect HNC from radiation cell kill in a xenograft model
and high expression of this enzyme did not affect the prognosis of patients treated with chemoradiation. We
have performed a screen from plant extracts and identified a natural product, d-limonene, which proves
to be a highly selective activator of ALDH3A1. Oral administration of d-limonene before, during and after RT
resulted in preservation of saliva function in mice after RT, but did not protect HNC cells from RT cell kill. Most
importantly, d-limonene has been studied as a chemoprevention agent and an anti-cancer therapy in cancer
patients and found to be well tolerated. Because of its favorable safety profile, d-limonene is a promising clinical
candidate for clinical translation.
Based on these data from, the main objectives of this proposal are: (1) To determine the maximum tolerated
dose of d-limonene in patients undergoing chemoradiation for HNC in a phase I dose escalation trial and to
obtain preliminary data on the effect of the drug on saliva production and patient quality of life, (2) To identify the
mechanism by which activation of ALDH3A1 in the absence of RT leads to increased SSPC self-renewal, (3) To
assess the effect of d-limonene and/or C5aR1 inhibition on radioprotection of other epithelial tissues including
skin, oral mucosa and esophageal mucosa. Our ultimate goals are to test whether ALDH3A1 activation with
d-limonene can mitigate RT-induced xerostomia in HNC patients and to develop novel approaches to
protect normal tissues from head and neck and thoracic irradiation."

advances in tumor imaging and radiation delivery techniques have significantly improved RT, advances in
genomic and molecular understanding of tumors have largely failed to impact management of patients treated
with RT. Therefore, development of “precision radiation oncology” approaches, defined as the use of molecular
biomarkers to personalize RT, remains a major unmet need. Our long-term goal is to develop novel,
molecularly-based precision radiation oncology approaches for NSCLC patients treated with RT. We previously
demonstrated that NSCLCs with KEAP1 or NFE2L2 mutations are radioresistant and have high rates of local
recurrence after RT. In this proposal we will develop a personalized radiosensitization strategy for
KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutant tumors based on inhibition of glutaminase, which plays a critical role in biosynthesis of
cellular free radical defenses. Prior studies have found conflicting results regarding the ability of glutaminase
inhibition to radiosensitize NSCLC. Our central hypothesis is that glutaminase inhibition can radiosensitize
KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutant but not wildtype NSCLCs and if correct would help explain the previous conflicting
results. We will therefore test if our genotype-specific radiosensitization approach has efficacy in KEAP1/NFE2L2
mutant but not wildtype NSCLC in vivo. We will also test if our approach increases normal tissue toxicity.
Additionally, we will identify specific KEAP1 mutations that cause radioresistance in order to enable identifying
patients with radioresistant tumors. In collaboration with Project 1, we will also test if the complement inhibitor
PMX205 can serve as an additional radiosensitizer for KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutant NSCLC. Finally, in collaboration
with Project 2 we will test if glutaminase inhibition can radiosensitize NFE2L2-mutant head and neck cancers.
If successful, our project will establish glutaminase inhibition as a precision radiation oncology strategy for
personalized radiosensitization of KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutant NSCLC. This approach could widen the therapeutic
index of RT since it would only expose patients at highest risk of local recurrence to the potential additional
toxicities of adding a radiation sensitizer. Our results will serve as the basis for developing clinical trials to attempt
to translate this strategy. These trials will involve genotyping of NSCLC patients undergoing RT in order to select
patients with KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations for concurrent treatment with RT and glutaminase inhibitors. Importantly,
our findings will serve as proof-of-principle that can likely also translate to other tumor types with frequent
KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations."
10914189,"Abstract (Project 4)
Radiation therapy is a standard treatment for many solid tumors including cervical, non-small cell lung (NSCLC)
cancer, and head and neck cancer. While effective in a large proportion of patients, local failure remains a
significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. An attractive strategy to radiosensitize tumors is targeting
cancer-specific glutamine metabolic reprogramming as this pathway supports tumor growth, survival, oxidative
stress responses and DNA damage repair. The RNA demethylase FTO is emerging as a therapeutic target for
cancer therapy as it is overexpressed and oncogenic in several cancers including cervical, non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and head and neck cancers. However, FTO has not previously been explored as a target for
tumor radiosensitization. Preliminary studies demonstrate that FTO inhibition reduces tumor growth and survival
in vitro and in vivo. At the molecular level, FTO inhibition reduces SLC1A5 expression and glutamine uptake in
cancer cells. Importantly, FTO inhibition radiosensitizes cervical and KEAP1 mutant NSCLC cancer cells. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that inhibition the RNA demethylase fat-mass and obesity-associated
(FTO) will enhance the therapeutic index of radiotherapy in solid tumors through the inhibition of
glutamine metabolism. Aim 1 will determine the anti-tumor effects of FTO inhibition in combination with
radiation on a range of solid tumors cancers using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. Aim 2 determine if
FTO inhibition enhances the radiation response in cancer cells by reducing glutamine metabolism, oxidative
stress and/or DNA damage repair responses using knockdown and gain of function approaches. Aim 3 will test
the hypothesis that FTO inhibition will not impact the radiation sensitivity of normal tissues that develop radiation-
induced toxicity when treating cervical, NSCLC and HNSCC tumors. The acute and late effects of FTO inhibition
on the radiation response in the bone marrow, intestine (collaboration with Project 1), salivary gland and oral
mucosa (collaboration with Project 2), and lung (collaboration with Project 3) will be analyzed using models of
global conditional FTO inactivation in adult mice. Together with Projects 1, 2 and 3 this project will investigate
the role of FTO in both the tumor and normal tissue radiation response with the goal of ascertaining the
therapeutic potential of FTO-based radiosensitizers. In addition to determining the tumor types that can be
effectively and safely treated with FTO inhibition, they will use cutting edge analytical tools to study the
mechanism of action. Successful completion of these aims will 1) identify FTO is an epitranscriptomic regulator
of cancer cell glutamine metabolism and oxidative stress; 2) provide the preclinical data to support FTO as a
safe and effective molecular target to radiosensitize tumors; 3) provide proof of concept studies to demonstrate
that small molecule targeting of FTO demethylase activity can radiosensitize tumors."
10914192,"Abstract (Core A)
Core A functions to provide the leadership, interaction and coordination between the different projects of the
Program Project Grant (PPG) in order to help them meet their scientific goals. Core A will work to ensure: (1)
that robust and timely statistical support is provided to all projects and Core B, (2) that the resources of the PPG
are distributed fairly among the projects, (3) that the regulations of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) are fulfilled,
and (4) that technical support for hardware and software is supplied. It can be divided into two sections: scientific
support and administrative support.
Support for biostatistics and bioinformatics is crucial for study design and data interpretation; thus it is an
important scientific function of Core A. A large team of highly experienced biostatisticians and bioinformaticians
(Ying Lu, Ph.D., Rie vonEyben, M.S., Andre Shultz, Ph.D., and Subarna Sinha, Ph.D.) will provide the needed
statistical support to all PPG members. In addition, Dr. Lu, who is the co-director of the Stanford Cancer Institute
Biostatistics Core, is able to mobilize additional statistical support from this larger core to assist the PPG as
needed. Other important functions of the scientific support will be: (1) to organize and hold regular meetings of
the project/ core leaders and key personnel, (2) to convene Executive Committee meetings to review the
progress and scientific direction of the grant, and (3) to organize an annual retreat with the members of the
External Advisory Board (EAB) to review the progress of the PPG as a whole. Mr. Frank Chavez will act as the
Administrative Coordinator of this PPG. He is currently the research program manager in the Department of
Radiation Oncology and has been working closely with the principal investigators (PIs), project and core leaders
in the preparation of the grant application. He has also been coordinating their bi-weekly meetings/ calls in the
last year. Mr. Eric Alemany will provide the technical support for all software and hardware problems and
questions. He has served in this role for 10 years in a previous PPG within the department and therefore is
familiar with the needed IT support and infrastructure. The administrative core will also be responsible for
submitting the yearly PPG progress report to the NCI, including the written report of the EAB.
An important aspect of administrative support will be to monitor the dispersion of financial resources and research
allocations. The PPG Executive Committee, which is composed of all four project leaders will meet twice a year to
review expenditures and resource allocations for the projects and cores. Ms. Joyce Chao, who has been a
finance analyst in the Department of Radiation Oncology for the past 6 years, will serve as the financial
administrator for this proposed PPG.
An additional function of the administrative core will be to disseminate information on Stanford seminars that are
broadly related to the scientific directions of the PPG. A final aspect of the scientific support will be to ensure that
all investigators are using common reagents to maintain uniformity in animal and experimental protocols."
10914063,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Thyroid cancer is rapidly increasing in the U.S. and is expected to be the 4th leading cancer diagnosis by 2030,
surpassing colorectal cancer. While most patients are cured of their thyroid cancer following initial treatment, a
significant portion of patients develop recurrent and aggressive disease. In fact, some well-differentiated thyroid
cancers develop into anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a highly lethal and treatment-resistant disease with an
abysmal 4-month survival. While these ATCs usually carry common driver-mutations such as BRAFV600E, studies
suggest that the majority also acquire activating mutations in the Wnt pathway. In addition, BRAF inhibitors have
shown limited efficacy in treating these aggressive thyroid tumors. Research in other cancers suggests that Wnt
signaling may play a role in the failure of BRAF inhibitor therapy. There is compelling evidence that thyroid
carcinomas are dependent on Wnt signaling, particularly poorly differentiated and aggressive disease. The goal
of this proposal is to discover the role of Wnt signaling in metastatic, recurrent, and treatment-resistant thyroid
cancer. My preliminary data on BRAFV600E-mutant thyroid cancer demonstrate alterations in Wnt/β-catenin
signaling following BRAF inhibition. My studies also create a unique thyroid cancer organoid system to study
primary patient-derived thyroid cancers across a heterogeneous landscape of genetic alterations. Finally, I
create a humanized patient-derived xenograft mouse model for thyroid cancer, with loss of murine MHCII and
MHCI that can serve to study the in vivo biology of thyroid cancer and to test new therapeutics (including anti-
Wnt drugs) against thyroid cancers resistant to standard-of-care therapy. In this proposal I will test the hypothesis
that Wnt signaling causes the increased invasive and metastatic potential of aggressive thyroid cancer. In Aim
1, I will define the in vivo effect of Wnt inhibition on the malignant phenotype of aggressive thyroid cancer. In Aim
2, I will discover the role of Wnt signaling in the resistance mechanism of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer following
BRAF inhibitor therapy. In Aim 3, I will use sequential patient samples to determine the drivers of Wnt signaling
upregulation in ATC. Through completion of these studies, I will define the role of Wnt signaling, a major
oncogenic pathway, in thyroid carcinoma. I anticipate that these pre-clinical studies will lead to clinical trials of
Wnt inhibitors for anaplastic thyroid cancer and dramatically improve detection and treatment of the most
aggressive forms of thyroid cancer. In addition, these studies will form the foundation of a strong research
program for a promising junior investigator. Through this K08 grant and the guidance by accomplished mentors,
I will gain the knowledge and experience needed to become an independently funded and successful physician-
scientist."
10914064,"Project Summary/Abstract
The monitoring of disease prevalence and estimation of the number of affected individuals in a defined
population are among the crucial goals of epidemiologic surveillance for chronic and infectious diseases. This
proposal aims to provide novel and reliable statistical tools to improve best practices for design and analysis of
such surveillance studies. We take specific motivation from timely challenges associated with the registry-
based monitoring of cancer recurrences in the state of Georgia Cancer Registry (GCR).
We focus on customizing capture-recapture (C-R) methods, which are ever increasingly used tools for
estimating total numbers of cases or deaths based on multiple epidemiologic surveillance streams. We clarify
underappreciated pitfalls associated with widely popular log-linear model-based C-R techniques, and propose
an accessible approach to sensitivity analysis with data visualization that promotes a general strategy for more
appropriate propagation of uncertainty into ultimate estimates of case totals. This in turn provides a gateway to
a broad class of useful models, whereby practitioners can transparently encode assumptions about how
surveillance streams operate relative to one another at the population level. As a next step, we consider the
case in which one surveillance stream is implemented by means of a well-controlled sampling design. Under
appropriate conditions, this provides what we refer to as an “anchor stream”, whereby otherwise ever-present
inherent uncertainties in specifying a defensible C-R model are overcome. In this setting, we will promote best
statistical practices for estimating case totals by means of a novel C-R estimator that harnesses the power of
the principled sampling behind the anchor stream while offering markedly enhanced precision. We propose to
extend this approach to account for misclassification, which is inevitable in the case of our motivating study of
cancer recurrence and in any setting in which surveillance streams identify cases in an error-prone manner.
We will tailor proposed methodology toward breast and colorectal cancer recurrence monitoring via the
ongoing Cancer Recurrence Information and Surveillance Program (CRISP), based on the GCR. CRISP is
actively compiling informative but potentially false-positive recurrence signals from up to 6 data streams, and
conducts validation sampling through protocol-based medical record review to confirm true cases among
signaled recurrences. We will use such validation data to adjust for misclassification in estimating C-R-based
recurrence counts. In particular, the current project will implement a principled “anchor stream” random sample
of 200 GCR patients for validation through medical record review, leading to valid and demonstrably precise
estimates of true recurrence counts over the study period that are free of misclassification bias."
10917394,"PROJECT SUMMARY (MAJEWSKI)
Mutations in histone and modifier genes in cancers have dramatic downstream effects on the landscape of the
epigenome – chromatin state and DNA methylation – with eventual secondary outcomes manifested in gene
expression and cellular phenotypes. Modern functional genomics approaches provide invaluable tools to study
the effects of this epigenome-mediated cascade. In this Core activity, we will establish and provide a set of
genomics tools and computation methods to elucidate the mechanisms through which histone variants impact
the epigenome, transcriptome, and the cell identity during neoplastic transformation."
10908746,"We submit an interdisciplinary NeuroEngineering program with the goal of educating and training future
generations of scientists, educators and innovators. We build on 16 years of experience with neuroengineering
training and more than 60 years of Biomedical Engineering predoctoral training. The program’s most salient
feature is a rich educational and collaborative research environment straddling both the engineering and medical
schools. For example, our students acquire depth in the biological sciences through courses in the medical
school or arts and sciences, and quantitative and computational sciences through courses in the engineering
school. The emerging transformative change is the opportunity to work with clinical scientists to translate the
discoveries and bringing the innovations into practice. Mentors to the program are from Biomedical Engineering,
other engineering departments, the Mind-Brain Institute, various clinical departments (Neurology, Neurosurgery,
Otolaryngology, Radiology), the School of Arts and Sciences (Cognitive Sciences), and the Applied Physics
Laboratory. Our research program is very well funded and we maintain an outstanding record of funding all
trainees in future years. Our student pool has been exceptional in quality and growing; we continue to draw from
a highly competitive national pool, and in recent years our efforts have yielded a very balanced gender pool and
a remarkable growth in recruiting under-represented minority. For the current phase of the training program, we
have added Clinical NeuroEngineering as a new track, implemented with the help of a number of highly regarded
clinical faculty. We have addressed the student interest in translational research and careers, by adding a
Translational NeuroEngineering track, involving entrepreneurial set of faculty. This is captured in a revised
NeuroEngineering 2.0 curriculum, for example, by capturing the emerging trend (and current pandemic-related
necessity) of distance learning, a distance learning (e-TRAIN) curriculum. We believe that this innovative
curriculum will prepare our students in more diverse and exciting scientific careers, not only academia but also
increasingly important careers in regulatory, industrial and entrepreneurial careers. A new student-led initiative
has been the Translational NeuroEngineering (TNT) initiative that has spawned several exciting local mentoring
and outreach activities. Building on this success, we will implement a new NeuroEngineering xTranslation (NExT)
initiative to encourage and mentor trainees interested in entrepreneurial careers. We have increased our effort
to promote diversity in our trainee pool, achieving gender parity, and a remarkable growth in under-represented
minority (URM) recruiting. We have achieved this progress through a deep commitment, from early, pre-
application, to late-phase ‘second look’ opportunities to educate and interest the URMs in our program. and
University has poured significant resources for across the board enhancement of URM funding, faculty, and
diversity initiatives. As the final step in the training journey, we will put in place a tight management and
evaluation of outcomes through the NeuroFeedback (NErF) system involving our extensive alumni community."

their pursuit of graduate education and biomedical research leadership."
10908286,"Project Summary
Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the world. At the core of the pathophysiology of heart failure is the
inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury. In contrast to adults, the newborn mouse
heart is capable of complete regeneration following various types of injury, providing a new inroad into possible
mechanisms of cardiac regeneration and repair. Previously, we discovered that Nuclear Factor Erythroid-derived
2-related factor 1 (NFE2L1, also known as NRF1) is highly expressed in a regenerative cardiomyocyte population
in neonatal mouse hearts. Although NRF1 does not directly promote cardiomyocyte proliferation, it confers strong
protection to cardiomyocytes under stress conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies show that NRF1
regulates proteostasis and redox balance in multiple tissues in response to cellular stress, while its cardiac
functions are largely unknown. This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to further dissect the biological and
pathological functions of NRF1 in cardiomyocytes to provide critical insight into the protective mechanism that
underlies regeneration and stress adaptation in the heart.
In this research plan, Aim 1 will establish how NRF1 protects neonatal cardiomyocytes. Aim 2 will demonstrate
the function of NRF1 in mammalian neonatal heart regeneration. Aim 3 will uncover the role of NRF1 as a stress
regulator in adult hearts following ischemic injury. In the mentored phase, Aims 1 and 2 will be carried out in the
laboratory of the renowned molecular biologist Dr. Eric Olson, and will generate data and mouse knockout
models for continued investigation in the independent phase. Aim 3 will be initiated during the K99 phase and
continued during the independent phase, dedicated to investigating the therapeutic potential of NRF1 to treat
adult ischemic heart disease. In order to gain research independence through mentored training, I will continue
to develop expertise in applying transcriptome profiling, including single-nucleus RNA sequencing, to study
neonatal heart regeneration (Aims 1 and 2). Such an experience will complement my prior training and constitute
an important data generating platform throughout my career. The proposed research requires that I acquire
additional mentoring in adult cardiac injury models and related cardiovascular phenotyping (Aim 3). Investigation
of NRF1 and its downstream pathways in regulating the stress response of cardiomyocytes during this mentored
training will lead to the establishment of an independent niche for my own academic career. In summary, this
application will provide me with the scientific training, mentoring, and career development necessary as I
transition to independence. Most importantly, the collective body of work generated through the completion of
the proposed aims will make major contributions to the field of cardiovascular science."
10908288,"Repair of the kidney tubules after an acute insult requires the clearance of dead cells and proliferative
repopulation of the tubules by those cells that survive the initial insult. Our data obtained by tracking individual
tubules using high resolution multiphoton Z-stack images on days 1 and 3 after ischemia-reperfusion injury
confirms that the S3 segment of the proximal tubule is the site of most tubular cell loss and intraluminal cast
formation, and that epithelial proliferation and cast clearance dominate the histologic findings in the outer stripe
of the renal medulla from days 2-5 after injury. During this exact time, macrophages (termed mononuclear
phagocytes (MNPs) for uniformity) progressively accumulate in the injured kidney and are specifically induced
to express reparative genes beginning on day 2-3 after ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). We now show that one
of those pro-repair markers, arginase 1 (Arg1), is selectively induced only in MNPs in the outer stripe directly
adjacent to the injured S3 segment. General depletion of reparative MNPs using liposomal clodronate or
selective knock-out of MNP Arg1 expression using LysM-Cre;Arg1fl/fl mice reduces both proliferative S3 repair
and cast clearance by the injured kidney, with increased mortality, higher BUN and creatinine, and worse tubule
repair in the MNP Arg1 null mice. Single cell RNA sequencing performed on cells isolated on day 3 after IRI or
sham operation demonstrates that these Arg1+ cells make up a distinct subset of MNP that selectively express
the homing receptors Ccr2 and CD74, while injured PT cells express the cognate ligands Ccl2 and Mif. The
specific induction of Arg1 in the OS MNP, combined with the ability of these cells to promote proliferative tubule
repair and cast clearance, has led us to hypothesize that the injured OS forms a niche for recruiting and
selectively activating MNP to facilitate S3 repair.
In this proposal we will use an in vitro OS mimetic to define the critical cellular components and secreted factors
that promote MNP homing and reparative activation in the OS, identify a pharmacologic approach to recreate
this reparative activation, and then use this pharmacologic activation of reparative MNP as well as imaging mass
cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF) analysis to validate these in vitro findings in the mouse kidney after IRI
(SA 1). We will then pursue the mechanism by which reparative macrophages induce epithelial proliferation and
cast clearance using a combination of candidate factor screening, scRNA-seq and proteomic analysis to identify
the MNP-secreted factors that stimulate tubule cell proliferation, as well as the role of reparative MNP in
detoxifying metabolites of PT cell amino acid catabolism and promoting cast degradation at the S3-thin
descending limb junction (SA 2). The combined output of this proposal will provide mechanistic understanding
of how MNPs promote both reparative proliferation and cast clearance, and we will use this information to
develop pharmacologic approaches to mimic these responses and facilitate kidney tubule repair."
10908290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The long-term objectives of the proposed program are to (i) discover type V CRISPR/Cas systems in exotic
microorganisms with unique features, (ii) elucidate a deeper understanding of the rules and mechanisms of
CRISPR/Cas and apply it for engineering and improving its activity, and (iii) apply them for gene editing and
diagnostic applications for a range of diseases. Although the type II CRISPR/Cas9 is the most studied genome
editing tool, the type V CRISPR/Cas12 systems are the most diverse with a wide range of functionally distinct
single-effector Cas12a-k nucleases that are emerging as next-generation tools for both genome editing and
nucleic acid detection. The central hypothesis is that (i) since the type V systems are most diverse and relatively
newer, only a handful (<5%) of these systems have been properly studied, while a vast majority of these systems
are understudied and poorly characterized and therefore, a systematic study of these systems will enable novel
tools for genome engineering, chromatin imaging, base editing, and diagnostics. (ii) A deeper understanding of
the sequence-structure-activity relationship by engineering crRNA and Cas will enable the development of
improved tools for metagenomic analysis, combinatorial enzymology, and multiplexing strategies for genome
editing and diagnostic applications. While the type V CRISPR/Cas share challenges of poor delivery, low gene
correction efficiency, and high off-target cleavage associated with other CRISPR-based genome editing tools,
they possess both orthogonal and overlapping challenges for diagnostic applications, including a) low catalytic
efficiency or poor sensitivity, b) high tolerance of mismatches or low specificity, c) poor stability for deployment,
and d) lack of control, desirable for multiplexing. In the first program, novel orthologs of type V CRISPR/Cas
systems will be discovered by metagenomic mining of exotic microorganisms that can thrive at extreme
conditions followed by expression and purification of Cas enzymes and crRNAs, identification of protospacer
adjacent motif requirement, and testing of enzymatic activity in a high-throughput fashion. In the second
program, crRNAs and Cas proteins will be modified with various strategies to improve target specificity and
activity. Modified crRNAs and Cas would allow elucidation of mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas systems that could
further allow improved detection of target DNA or RNA. Finally, integrating novel and engineered CRISPR/Cas
with model systems would enable the development of multiplexed technologies that will have broader impacts
in the detection and treatment of a wide range of diseases. The PI's lab has already made significant
contributions in all three proposed programs with several key collaborations and publications and is poised
to run a successful research and training program. The expected outcomes of the support from the Maximizing
Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) for Early Stage Investigators include the establishment of an integrative
research program to discover, understand, and engineer unique CRISPR/Cas systems and addressing of major
problems in their applications for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases, cancers, and genetic disorders."

Despite the availability of effective HIV prevention tools such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), significant

gonorrhea or syphilis infection, across the state of Alabama (AL), highlighted as a geographic hotspot by the
federal Ending the HIV Epidemic strategy, to better understand factors associated with risk of STI and HIV
diagnosis and predictors for PrEP use. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) refine the HealthMpowerment
(HMP) digital platform, previously utilized to deliver evidence-based interventions to improve HIV and
prevention outcomes among Black men who have sex with men and transgender women, to include key
elements that optimally engage and retain a cohort of women at-risk for HIV in AL; this will be achieved via
stakeholder engaged research with self-identified women on PrEP and PrEP care team members using
nominal group techniques; 2) recruit and retain a geographically-diverse and rurally-enhanced cohort of 800
women ages 18-44, with recent positive gonorrhea or syphilis testing who are STI- and HIV-uninfected at
enrollment, to participate in the Camellia digital cohort utilizing a geographically diverse sampling framework
using public and commercially available annual county-level HIV and STI testing data and 3) evaluate
predictors, mediators and moderators for STI/HIV incidence and PrEP use and adherence in the Camellia
Cohort by collecting demographic, behavioral, and community level assessments via the HMP digital platform
and HIV/STI testing through ADPH’s home testing program at regular intervals; we will purposefully sample
women with high HIV vulnerability and/or PrEP use within the cohort for in-depth interviews (n = 30) to further
explore factors contributing to PrEP use to guide future intervention development. This research will lay the
groundwork for a larger research program testing the implementation of a further adapted HMP digital platform
designed to improve HIV/STI testing, PrEP utilization and persistence among women in the Deep South,
focusing on areas with higher HIV incidence."

The Administrative Core for the Cornell FIRST program will support the hiring and retention of 10 new 
assistant professors from groups underrepresented in their fields, while transforming institutional climate 
into a culture of inclusive excellence. The strength of Cornell’s program is its foundational roots as a 
complex private institution with a public mission, with its founding based on support for diversity, a culture of 
interdisciplinary research, and a track record of catalyzing change at different scales that were 
institutionalized. Given Cornell’s success in establishing programs for the effective development and 
support of early-career faculty, particularly those underrepresented in their fields, Cornell is in an excellent 
position to test the hypothesis that FIRST Cohort faculty will be successful in an environment that 
supports advocacy through sponsorship, consistent and individual-centered mentoring, and 
evidence-based professional development. We further hypothesize that Cornell’s institutional 
culture and scientific excellence will be enhanced with the hiring of a FIRST Cohort of diverse 
faculty. Cornell’s FIRST program features interdisciplinary hiring of faculty underrepresented in their fields, 
across six colleges and 20 departments, with a focus on retention, career development, and evaluation. The 
Administrative Core of the Cornell FIRST program will develop an inclusive FIRST Cohort search 
process that will lead to 10 hires in 3 clusters encompassing quantitative biomedical sciences, infection 
biology and health equity; hire and retain a diverse FIRST cohort of new faculty taking advantage of 
Cornell’s existing interdisciplinary field system approach where faculty are organized by research interest 
rather than by department; and will foster sustainable institutional culture change to support FIRST 
Cohort faculty to enhance their development, retention, progression, and promotion. Here, Cornell 
will accelerate its Belonging at Cornell framework for developing a culture of Inclusive Excellence, using a 
combination of institutional policies that impact hiring, mentoring, promotion and tenure, salary equity, and 
other initiatives aimed at enhancing compositional diversity, retention, and success of our faculty. We 
expect that the Cornell FIRST program will successfully hire, retain, and support 10 new faculty 
underrepresented in their fields, while fostering sustainable institutional culture change. These activities will 
result in increased diversity of the faculty in the biological, biomedical, and health sciences at Cornell, while 
contributing to the diversity of academy, and future generations of the STEM workforce."
10910928,"Project Summary (Faculty Development Core)
Cornell University is ideally suited to develop and test innovative approaches to increase faculty diversity and 
to create a robust culture of inclusive excellence. Its multiple colleges operate with substantial autonomy and 
are laboratories for innovation, leading Cornell to an enviable track record of designing innovative approaches 
that have been adopted around the country. These “experiments” have established programming and policies 
that have resulted in significant and measurable gains in both hiring and retention of faculty from diverse 
backgrounds, including women. These policies have positively engaged faculty search committees in adopting 
best practices for inclusive hiring, resulting in increased hiring of women and other individuals from 
underrepresented or minoritized backgrounds in STEM. Cornell also has a successful track record of 
combining institutional investments with federal programs to effect institutional culture change and make 
steady progress in increasing representational diversity of STEM faculty. Effective implementation of the best 
laid policies can fall short if systemic bias in policies and the academic environment into which we hire new 
faculty are not considered as part of a holistic process. Using the seed and soil model proposed by Dr. 
Beronda Montgomery of Michigan State University, we propose a highly innovative Cornell FIRST Faculty 
Development Program that addresses both the seed (faculty member) and the soil (the community and 
climate) to ensure that FIRST faculty hires reach their full potential and succeed at Cornell. We hypothesize
that a robust, evidence-based faculty development program across Cornell will create fertile ground 
(culture) for inclusive excellence and belonging and ensure that FIRST faculty are successful. We 
propose innovative programs for the FIRST cohort and other faculty who are underrepresented or marginalized 
in their fields by implementing our Faculty Development Initiative. Cornell will build FIRST faculty community 
by creating a sense of belonging in the discipline and across Cornell. We will connect FIRST faculty 
professionally and socially across their clusters and cohort, within departmental units and research fields, and 
across the university through a variety of formal and informal networking and community-building opportunities.
Cornell will also foster individual research and career development for all FIRST faculty by providing
tailored culturally relevant professional development opportunities to FIRST faculty to facilitate the successful 
start-up of their research programs, communicate clear pathways for promotion and tenure, and support 
success in their faculty roles. We expect that the Cornell FIRST program will successfully hire, retain, and 
support 10 new faculty underrepresented in their fields, while fostering sustainable institutional culture change. 
These activities will result in increased diversity of the faculty in the biological, biomedical, and health sciences
at Cornell, while contributing to the diversity of academy, and future generations of the STEM workforce."
10910929,"Project Summary (Evaluation Core)
The Cornell FIRST Evaluation Core will provide program evaluation of the Cornell FIRST Cohort program 
and work collaboratively with the FIRST CEC to ensure overall program evaluation and outcome tracking.
The proposed activities in this core address our Monitoring and Evaluation Initiative to critically assess the 
progress of the program, test our models to ensure that the above initiatives are generalizable, that they are 
implemented in an effective manner, and that lessons learned are incorporated throughout the program as it 
evolves. The activities of this core assess the primary NIH FIRST hypothesis that a cohort and cluster 
design model of faculty hiring, sponsorship, continual mentoring, and professional development, 
embedded within an institution implementing evidence-based practices will foster a culture of
academic cultures of inclusive excellence. Assessing the primary NIH FIRST hypothesis requires a 
multi-faceted mixed-methods systems thinking approach. The Cornell FIRST Monitoring and Evaluation 
Initiative, in collaboration with the FIRST CEC, will follow a collaboratively developed program logic model 
and comprehensive evaluation plan. It will incorporate development and integration of program theory and 
program logic; integration of qualitative and quantitative mixed methods; the incorporation of a variety of 
stakeholders and participants; and both formative and summative design. We will do this by implementing 
Specific Aim #4 from the Overall Core, to evaluate and learn from our hiring, climate, and faculty 
development approaches by identifying which strategies and activities are most effective and sustainable at 
an institutional scale, by assessing and monitoring the FIRST programs and activities to ensure that they 
are meeting their planned goals, provide continuous learning and program improvement feedback to the 
Cornell Institutional Steering Committee to ensure the highest success of the FIRST cohort through the 
aims, strategies, and activities, and to ensure integration and synergy with FIRST CEC to facilitate overall 
FIRST program evaluation and outcome tracking. The evaluation will be carried out by a highly skilled team 
that includes two external evaluators with decades of equity focused evaluation experience in higher 
education, including experience evaluating the NIH Diversity Program Consortium."
10918070,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants (HSCTs) are considered a potentially curative option for patients with
certain cancers of the blood and bone marrow and over 20,000 HSCTs are performed in the US each year.
However, HSCTs are associated with high risk due to the required removal of diseased bone marrow before
transplantation. Until the transplanted cells engraft and proliferate enough to reconstitute the patient’s immune
system, the patient is considered neutropenic during which they are highly susceptible to infection. In addition to
the potentially life-threatening physical risk to the patient, neutropenia necessitates long hospitalization time that
can in part drives the expensive cost of HSCTs ranging up to $400,000 in the US. A current strategy in clinical
trials is to transplant larger pools of donor HSCs to shorten the neutropenic phase. However, these approaches
all rely on ex vivo culturing of donor cells that depend on imperfect man-made culture systems that may disrupt
the proper function of the stem cells and can be prohibitively expensive. Ship of Theseus’ innovative solution is
a drug that will be used for a brief, one-time exposure to donor cells prior to transplantation that improves
expansion in vivo. Our drug is a patented mutant of nuclear transcription factor, Homeobox protein B4
(HOXB4(m)), which promotes HSC expansion without differentiation. HOXB4(m) has improved degradation
resistance, which enables us to overcome several shortcomings of HOXB4 (e.g., short protein half-life and
myeloproliferative disorders associated with genetic overexpression). By elongating its intracellular half-life,
HOXB4(m) is practical for clinical use while potentially avoiding adverse effects induced by constitutive
overexpression. Early preclinical data indicating treating cells with HOXB4(m) can expand all major lineages of
HSCs while maintaining multipotency. However, current delivery of HOXB4(m) is limited by its ability to penetrate
cells and localize in the nucleus, the site of its bioactivity.
The goal of this R61/R33 proposal is to improve efficiency and safety of HOXB4(m) by improving its nuclear
delivery. This will be accomplished through the execution of 3 aims. In Aim 1 (R61), we will perform a library
screen to identify optimal combinations of cell penetrating peptide and nuclear targeting motifs for HOXB4(m)
nuclear localization. In Aim 2 (R33), we will assess in vitro efficacy of the top candidates to select a lead
candidate. In Aim 3 (R33), we will demonstrate long-term hematopoietic reconstitution without adverse effects
or GVHD of our lead candidate in vivo in a mouse HSCT study. Successful completion of this R61/R33 program
will demonstrate feasibility of an improved HOXB4(m) candidate that maintains efficacy at lower concentrations
and briefer exposure periods. This project will provide the necessary data to support future extensive in vivo
efficacy and safety studies necessary for an IND submission. With HOXB4(m), we can circumvent the original
hurdles of HOXB4 and improve expansion in vivo to benefit HSCT patients by shortening the neutropenic phase
to reduce infection, hospitalization time, and cost."
10918192,"Early treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can
improve long-term outcomes, but only when at-risk children are identified promptly and accurately. Early risk
factors common to both conditions (e.g. premature birth, perinatal complications) are collected during routine
care and are accessible in the electronic health record (EHR), but have not been used at scale to stratify risk or
improve early screening. The central premise of the proposed research is that the EHR contains
information that can help identify children at risk for ASD and ADHD early in development, but
translating this information into clinically actionable measures requires new predictive modeling methods.
Our recent NIMH-supported research provides initial support for this premise. We have discovered that
children later diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD have distinctive patterns of early health system utilization, and
that EHR data acquired by age 1 already contains information predictive of later ASD risk. Building on this
work, the proposed research will develop and deploy ASD and ADHD risk prediction models that can
directly inform clinical decision-making. First, we propose to develop methods and prediction models that
will optimize prediction performance, mitigate known sources of bias, and intelligently surveil model-predicted
risk by balancing benefits of earlier identification against the value of waiting for more data. Second, we
propose to take critical steps toward clinical use by prospectively evaluating these models, deploying them in
the Duke University Health System (DUHS) EHR, and working with providers to develop and evaluate a
prototype EHR dashboard that presents ASD and ADHD risk and projected follow-up length to inform clinical
decision-making. Career development goals will allow the candidate to develop expertise needed to establish
an independent, transdisciplinary research program in machine learning for pediatric mental health. Career
training will be tightly integrated with the proposed research and emphasize deployment, evaluation, and
implementation of risk prediction models for ASD and ADHD. In the proposed study, DUHS EHR data will be
accessed through a high-quality, empirically validated data pipeline for all children born after 10/1/2006. Data
elements will include diagnosis and procedure codes, lab measures and vitals, clinical notes, and encounter
details. Diagnoses will be identified using ICD-10-based criteria previously validated at DUHS. The study will
begin with creation of a secure, regularly updated diagnosis risk prediction database to facilitate a smooth
transition to EHR deployment. Activities will focus on methods and model development in years 1-2 followed by
development, deployment, and evaluation of the risk prediction dashboard beginning in year 3. This research
will dovetail with concurrent and subsequent work exploring novel ASD screening methods and model-guided
interventions at DUHS, including patient- and provider-centered early intervention strategies. The proposed
career development will support the PI’s transition to independence and health data science initiatives at Duke."
10916154,"SUMMARY
Access to high efficacy contraceptive options and family planning services enable women to control the size and
timing of their families which is paramount to reducing gender inequities and allowing women to reach their full
social, economic, and educational potential. On Friday, June 24, 2022, the United States Supreme Court
overturned the Dobbs decision, which removed the nearly 50 years of precedent of federal protection to the right
to abortive services. In the US, more than 19 million women live in a county without reasonable access to the
full range of contraceptive services, and 1.2 million of these women live in a county without a single health center
offering the full range of services. Because 90% of the population lives within 5 miles of a pharmacy, pharmacist-
prescribed contraceptive services (PPCSs) can dramatically increase access to care, decrease health inequities,
and combat the high unintended pregnancy rate in the US. In July 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
cleared Opill, the first over-the-counter progestin-only contraceptive. Currently, only 4% of oral contraceptive
users take a progestin-only option. More patients will now turn to the pharmacy for contraceptive services, but
pharmacies are not well-equipped to assist. To increase the adoption of PPCSs, an Electronic Health Records
(EHR) system must be utilized to increase safety, compliance, reimbursements, and scalability to meet the
nation’s needs. The OvaryIt Pharmacy Platform (OPP) is a smart, contraceptive-specific EHR with embedded
clinical decision support (CDS) tools to increase workflow efficiencies and assist providers in delivering safe,
high-quality contraceptive care to patients. The OPP layers the CDC’s United States Medical Eligibility Criteria
for Contraceptive Use (USMEC) guidelines with contraceptive prescribing best practices to create an end-to-end
solution for prescribing contraceptives. The Phase I results demonstrate that the OPP has safety, efficiency,
workload assessment, and usability benefits for pharmacists compared to the current standard paper charting
workflow. The pharmacist participants in the Phase I study overwhelmingly preferred the OPP and indicated that
it increases confidence and the feasibility of incorporating contraceptive services into their clinical workflows.
The Specific Aims proposed in this application are designed to build upon the Phase I prototype lessons learned,
to create a commercialized Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Aim 1: Modify the OPP prototype to incorporate user
interface (UI) changes to the system’s CDS features based on lessons learned from Phase I and repeat a study
of 10 new pharmacist end-users performing a simulated encounter on the modified system to study the effect of
the UI changes. Aim 2: Completion of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to create the OPP SaaS
platform. Aim 3: Completion of a 120-day OPP Pilot Program utilizing the OPP SaaS platform in 5 pharmacies
in the US to collect real-world data. The successful completion of this SBIR Phase II project is expected to result
in the creation and commercialization of an end-user driven SaaS platform that incentivizes the adoption of
pharmacist contraceptive services."
10918120,"Abstract
Unlike many cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a hypoxic, nutrient-
deprived, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and a fibrotic stroma that may impair treatment
response. Recent single-cell studies suggest a complex interplay between malignant tumor cells and other cell
types within the TME, with crosstalk between tumor and stromal cell types influencing malignant cell phenotypes,
including responses to therapy. Understanding these interactions will provide insight into PDAC progression and
therapy resistance.
In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major non-immune cell component of the TME and are
comprised of several distinct subtypes that vary based on tumor subtype and the surrounding
microenvironmental niche. In this proposal, we bring together a multidisciplinary team of basic and translational
investigators that will build upon our prior studies to investigate the Tumor-TME co-organizer model with a focus
on interrogating interactions between PDAC tumor cells and CAFs in the TME. Specifically, we will examine the
overarching hypothesis that reciprocal signaling between tumor cells and CAFs shapes malignant cell and CAF
phenotypes in a context-specific manner that can be modulated by prior therapy and the organ-specific niche.
We will leverage multiple built-in capabilities, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), patient-
derived organoid (PDO) and matched fibroblast models, functional genetic screens and clinical trials with serial
biopsies to study the PDAC TME continuum in disease progression and resistance to therapy. Specifically, we
propose (1) to determine whether targeting organ-specific PDAC-CAF interactions enhances therapeutic
responses, (2) to interrogate novel vulnerabilities resulting from tumor cell and CAF reprogramming during PDAC
therapy, and (3) investigate whether TGFB blockade disrupts tumor cell-CAF crosstalk and sensitizes PDAC to
chemotherapy. In pursuing these studies, we will work with other members of the PDAC Stromal Reprogramming
Consortium (PSRC) to pursue collaborative studies to understand how PDAC and TME interactions program
tumor progression and therapy responses."
10917084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite adverse metabolic and functional consequences of obesity, dietary weight loss (WL) recommendation
remains controversial for older adults due to WL associated reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) and
increased risk of osteoporotic fracture. Several studies show a positive effect of exercise on BMD in weight-
stable, older adults; however, literature examining the ability of exercise to preserve bone during dietary WL is
surprisingly equivocal. Discordant findings may be due to varying exercise prescriptions, with recent data from
our group suggestive of a superior ability of progressive resistance training (RT) to minimize bone loss during
dietary WL, as compared to aerobic training. Nevertheless, some bone loss still occurs with RT, prompting the
consideration of alternate or adjuvant osteoprotective strategies. Pharmacotherapy represents another
countermeasure strategy, and several medications are FDA-approved to prevent and treat osteoporosis.
Bisphosphonates, in particular, are a promising choice as they decrease bone resorption (which is upregulated
during WL) and also appear to blunt the catabolic effect of acute exercise on bone, thereby signaling the
potential for additive effects during WL — though these hypotheses have not been formally tested. To address
these knowledge gaps, the proposed 12 month, 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial will compare the
independent and combined effects of RT plus bone loading exercise and bisphosphonate use on dietary WL
associated bone loss among 392 older (60+ years) adults with obesity (BMI=30-40 kg/m2) who are also at risk
for low BMD (total hip T-score: 0 to -2.2) at Wake Forest University and The University of Colorado-Anschutz
Medical Campus. All participants will receive the same group-mediated dietary WL intervention and be
randomized to one of four groups: no RT and placebo capsules (NoRT+PL); progressive RT plus bone-loading
exercises and placebo capsules (RT++PL); no RT and bisphosphonate capsules (70 mg weekly oral
alendronate; NoRT+BIS); or progressive RT plus bone-loading exercises and bisphosphonate capsules
(RT++BIS). Due to its robust change following dietary WL and clinical utility in predicting fracture, our primary
outcome is change in total hip aBMD measured via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This will be
complemented by DXA assessment at other skeletal sites, as well as high resolution peripheral quantitative
computed tomography (HR-pQCT) derived compartmental volumetric (v)BMD, trabecular bone
microarchitecture, cortical thickness/porosity, and strength at the distal radius and tibia — allowing for
assessment of intervention effectiveness on novel measures of bone quality. Finally, assessment of
biomarkers of bone turnover and metabolism will provide insight into the roles of RT+ and BIS on the bone
remodeling unit during dietary WL."

Persistent immune activation is the defining feature of HIV-1 infection in vivo and a driver of progression
to end-stage AIDS. Systemic immune activation in people living with HIV has been hypothesized to
account for higher incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive
disorders (HAND). While significant neurological complications associated with HIV-1 infection occur
years after seroconversion and is commonly coincident with progressive immunosuppression and high
viral loads, establishment of a virus reservoir in the CNS occurs with primary infection. Furthermore, acute
infection in the CNS is thought to initiate a cascade of pro-inflammatory events that result in inflammation-
induced neuronal injury and associated neurocognitive disorders that are evident even in the present
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era. Approximately 12 million people inject drugs globally, 13%
of these are people living with HIV. Opioid misuse is a route of HIV acquisition and a barrier to effective
antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, it is unclear whether opioid misuse changes the course of HIV
pathogenesis, especially on HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Our central hypothesis is that
opioid misuse exacerbates HIV pathogenesis in the CNS by dysregulating the glial population in the brain.
Our overall objective is to exploit cell type specific transcriptomic information at the single nuclei level from
patient brain samples to characterize the effects of opioid use disorder on CNS neuronal and glial cells,
HIV infection and HANDs. We will characterize single nuclei gene expression and identify dysregulated
gene regulatory networks in each of the neuronal and glial populations associated with opioid misuse in
HIV infected individuals and/or with HANDs. We will also perform computational analysis to identify
neuronal and glial cell regulatory networks altered by opioid misuse. In the validation component, we will
select the top 20 targets from single cell transcriptomics profiles, first validating with
immunohistochemistry with fixed brain tissue, then selecting a few top targets and using 2D and 3D
cultures of iPS derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes to characterize functionality with CRISPR
knockout. Successful completion of these aims will have significant research and clinical impact by 1)
elucidating how opioid misuse alters HIV/HAND pathogenesis in the CNS, and 2) discovering candidate
molecules to regulate HIV infection or persistence in the CNS in the context of opioid misuse."
10914874,"Smoking is the leading risk factor for bladder cancer and is estimated to account for half of the 80,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. Patients who quit after diagnosis have improved quality-of-life, lower risk of recurrence, and a 3-fold lower chance of dying from bladder cancer compared to those who continue to smoke. Yet only one in 5 urologists delivers smoking cessation treatment to patients, and considerable gaps in patient awareness and guideline-concordant screening and referral exist in the urology setting. These factors contribute to adults with bladder cancer being the least likely to quit smoking after diagnosis, compared to all other cancer survivors. Increased use of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment will improve outcomes for the estimated 100,000 patients with bladder cancer who continue to smoke. 
The proposed research project aims to investigate and optimize the delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment for patients with bladder cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Specific Aim 1 will evaluate how smoking cessation treatment is given to patients with bladder cancer by quantifying practice patterns and exploring factors associated with sub-optimal care delivery. Specific Aim 2 will identify determinants of smoking cessation treatment using qualitative methods that will help elucidate multi-level determinants of evidence-based practices. Specific Aim 3 will adapt our current tobacco treatment strategy to the urology context using theory-based implementation science methods informed by our mixed-methods explanatory study (Aims 1 and 2) and will pilot promising strategies. The proposed research represents a significant step towards understanding and improving the delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment for patients with bladder cancer. Our findings will establish a theory-based paradigm to facilitate smoking cessation treatment within diverse surgical oncology contexts at MSK while improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of implementation science. 
The proposed research project is accompanied by a training plan that will provide the candidate with critical expertise in advanced biostatistics and data science, qualitative research methods, and implementation science. This will be accomplished through a detailed plan that involves coursework, collaboration, and experiential learning corresponding to each Specific Aim of the study. This career development and training plan will give the candidate a set of skills unique among urologists and will be guided by a world-class group of mentors and collaborators at a premier academic medical center and partner hospitals. The members of this multidisciplinary team will each contribute unique expertise to the candidate’s novel and innovative career development plan and research proposal. This career development award will position him to make significant contributions in the future as an independent investigator in health services research and urologic oncology."
10914804,"ABSTRACT/NARRATIVE
Cancer cachexia (CCX), wasting of muscle and/or adipose, is associated with 20-30% of all cancer related
deaths.1 Our clinical studies have shown that the presence of CCX is associated with a 50% decrease in median
survival (14 months vs 28 months, p<0.001) independent of tumor-directed therapies.2-3 There are no FDA-
approved CCX regimens, with a majority of trials focused on limiting sarcopenia. Using multiple established
murine CCX mouse models, we consistently observed significant adipose tissue loss compared to muscle
atrophy. Furthermore, blocking adipocyte lipolysis using global lipase null mice limited both adipose wasting and
sarcopenia in murine models of CCX. Understanding upstream mechanisms cancers use to provoke adipose
lipolysis and wasting could offer novel therapeutic targets to reverse CCX syndrome.
 The complex intracellular (stromal, vascular, immune, and adipocyte) interactions within adipose tissue
ultimately regulate CCX wasting by altering the relative signals of adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis and synthesis.
To understand the convergence of these interactions, we developed an in vitro CCX adipocyte assay to screen
secreted factors from CCX lines that increase adipose inflammation and wasting by inducing adipocyte lipolysis
and identified the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).5 Through the JAK-dependent inflammatory
reprogramming of adipose tissue in mice, recombinant LIF caused a decrease in adipose mass by >50%, lean
mass, and body weight by >10%, recapitulating CCX. LIF also altered the adipose expression and systemic
levels of other cyto/adipokines to amplify this inflammation and alter food intake. Use of JAK inhibitors in murine
CCX models led to decreased adipose inflammation (decreased STAT3 phosphorylation), adipocyte lipolysis,
and adipose/muscle wasting, all increasing survival. To understand the contributions of adipose intracellular
signaling in the regulation of CCX adipose inflammation, we selectively silenced the LIF receptor (LIFR) or
STAT3 in adipocytes. Both mouse models doubled their adipose mass compared to littermate controls during
development highlighting an inverse CCX phenotype. When allotransplanted with CCX tumors, both models still
demonstrated adipose inflammation with persistent STAT3 phosphorylation, resulting in a partial suppression of
CCX and defining the non-adipocyte cellular contributions of adipose to CCX wasting. FACS analysis verified
longitudinal enrichment of immune cells during CCX progression, offering additional tumor/cytokine targets
supporting CCX adipose inflammation and wasting. We hypothesize that CCX adipose inflammation occurs via
a JAK-dependent Tumor-Cytokine-Adipose Axis that reprograms adipose through JAK/STAT signaling of
multiple cellular subtypes to increase adipocyte lipolysis and alter secretion of cyto/adipokines, resulting in
wasting. SA1-2 will dissect the multiple cellular/molecular signaling components of this axis facilitating adipose
inflammation in support of this CCX wasting. SA3 will validate associations between JAK/STAT signaling events
in human adipose to CCX induction in patients."
10914805,"Treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) represents an unmet need in medicine. We have been pursuing a
therapeutic approach of delivering potent targeted and specific cytotoxins using convection-enhanced delivery
(CED). We and others found that patients with GBM over-express interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13RA2),
EphA2, EphA3 and EphB2 receptors. These receptors are present in various pathophysiological compartments
of GBM and all four are expressed in tumor cells of the core of tumor and in locally-infiltrating tumor cells, while
EphA2 is also found in tumor neovasculature. Further, IL-13RA2, EphA2, and EphA3 are associated with, and
play crucial roles in, the pathobiology of glioma stem-like cells (GSC). Finally, the EphA3 receptor can be
readily detected in M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TMA). Thus, collectively, IL-13RA2, EphA2, EphA3
and EphB2 are over-expressed in principal GBM compartments shown to be involved in tumor progression
and/or resistance to therapies. One of the Eph receptor ligands, ephrinA5 (eA5), binds EphA2, EphA3 and
EphB2 receptors. In the current project, we will pursue the novel idea of targeting all four receptors with one
pharmaceutical compound delivered using monitored and effective CED. We have already engineered an
agent based on eA5 and IL-13 mutants targeting all four receptors using an IgG1 scaffold and conjugated it to a
modified bacterial toxin to form QUAD 3.0-PE38QQR. The conjugate is safe and effective in GBM tumors. We
will continue this exciting line of research through three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate
QUAD 3.0-PE38QQR distribution, safety and anti-tumor activity in treating canine high-grade gliomas, which
represents the closest model of human disease. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop QUAD 3.0-PE38QQR for
first-in-human Phase I clinical trial in patients with recurrent GBM. We will make QUAD 3.0-PE38QQR under
Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) conditions. The QUAD-CTX will undergo pre-clinical animal studies,
based on pre-IND discussions with the FDA. Studies will be performed under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)
conditions in order to obtain an Investigational New Drug (IND). In the third Specific Aim, we will perform
Phase I clinical trial with QUAD 3.0-PE38QQR in patients with recurrent GBM. The focus will be on obtaining
optimal volume of distribution of the CED-administered drug, its safety, initial efficacy and evidence of inducing
immune responses. Thus, with one therapeutic agent and improved delivery system, we will be
eliminating tumor cells and abnormal cells of the tumor microenvironment promoting its growth. This
approach also addresses crucial issues of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and is also expected to evoke
an in situ vaccination or so called “tumor inflaming” effect. We envision that this all-out assault, termed by us
“molecular resection”, will result in a more effective management of GBM."

The main goal of the Animal Model/Pathology (AMP) Core is to provide expert support for animal research within 
the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (EZID), including the selection of appropriate models, 
biosafety and IACUC compliance submissions, and advanced, personalized pathology services for a variety of 
species. The AMP Core will oversee and support all animal experimentation and post experimental 
pathology evaluations performed by EZID project leaders (PLs). Animal experiments will be conducted in 
Kansas State University (KSU) animal facilities located in Coles Hall in the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) 
and at the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI). Vivarium rooms at Coles Hall provide the capability to conduct 
research with rodents and other small vertebrates in BSL-2 containment. Animal research space at the BRI 
includes BSL-3Ag animal rooms and an ABSL-3 vivarium. BRI facilities allow work with select agents, including 
zoonotic pathogens for animal experiments at BSL-3 level of containment. The main focus of the AMP Core will 
be supporting on-going primary and pilot/seed projects of the EZID COBRE Center involving animal studies and 
pathology analysis. All support will be personalized and project-specific with the focus to satisfy specific animal 
research needs of the individual EZID PLs. The AMP Core will provide assistance and expertise in appropriate 
study designs and in preparing and obtaining IACUC approval. The Core will also coordinate with the 
Comparative Medicine Group (CMG; responsible for animal and veterinary care) and BRI timelines and space 
allocation. The AMP Core will oversee and support the execution of animal studies conducted by the Center's 
primary and pilot/seed PLs and their teams. The Core will also develop and conduct pilot studies on development 
of challenge models in rodents and other small animals essential for EZID Center projects. For pathological 
evaluations, the AMP Core will utilize expertise and equipment available in the Department of Diagnostic 
Medicine/Pathobiology. All pathologic evaluations, tissue collections, and testing will be done under the oversight 
of the AMP Core Associate Director, a board-certified pathologist. Existing infrastructure will be enhanced by 
adding new equipment and services to expand capabilities of the Core and ensure its sustainability. This includes 
the acquisition of a laser capture microdissection instrument which will allow significant synergy between the two 
COBRE cores and for the first time at KSU the performance of single-cell RNA-Seq experiments. The AMP Core 
will also produce hybridomas and hyper-immune sera for the development of diagnostic tests essential to 
COBRE research projects. This work will be done in coordination with the Molecular and Cellular Biology Core 
to ensure that appropriate sample testing methodology is developed and available for testing of the generated 
antibodies. Successful implementation of the AMP Core will improve the biomedical research infrastructure 
within EZID and at KSU and significantly contribute to the overall COBRE objectives."

biology methodologies that will be utilized. The Core has already established the feasibility of providing advanced 
imaging technology, next-generation DNA sequencing and CRISPR resources to junior project leaders. These 
activities will be tightly integrated with the Animal Model and Pathology (AMP) Core. The AMP core will also 
undergo technological upgrades, including the acquisition of a laser capture microdissection instrument. 
Significant synergy will exist between the two cores and will allow for the first time at KSU the performance of 
single-cell RNA-Seq experiments. The MCB Core will directly support the Center's primary and pilot/seed 
projects, as well as the community of users within KSU and the regional scientific network (RSN), including 
faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students. The significant enhancement of the MCB Core facilities will also 
provide an excellent training environment for the robust Ph.D. program at KSU. Most importantly, MCB Core 
upgrades will improve the overall infrastructure for biomedical research at KSU."
10915422,"Project Summary:
Emerging infectious diseases account for at least 12% of all human pathogens. Increased globalization among
other factors led the World Health Organization to predict that novel infectious agents will continue to appear at
an unprecedented rate. To protect society against these pathogens, it is essential to know all of the potential
mechanisms by which infectious agents can cause disease. While viral infections are known to cause 15-20%
of cancers, persistent genus β human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infections cause non-melanoma skin cancers. β-
HPV's role in these malignancies is through a novel mechanism that could be shared with emerging pathogens.
Specifically, β-HPV infections act as co-factor that along with UV, blocks DNA repair and reduces host genome
fidelity. The resulting mutations can drive tumorigenesis without continued exposure to UV or β-HPV. In addition
to abundant supportive epidemiological, animal model, and cell culture evidence from other labs, the PI and his
group have established the ability of a β-HPV gene (β-HPV E6) to attenuate the expression of four cellular DNA
repair factors. β-HPV E6's inhibition of repair stem primarily from the viral protein's degradation of a cellular
transcription factor, p300. This proposal defines the extent that the p300 loss prevents cells from mitigating
genome destabilizing events, particularly events occurring during S-phase. AIM1 interrogates β-HPV E6's
inhibition of signaling events triggered by DNA crosslinks. AIM2 defines the mechanisms of β-HPV E6's
impairment of double strand DNA break repair. AIM3 determines how β-HPV E6 attenuates the regulation of
centrosome duplication. The research team uses a combination of cutting edge techniques as well as traditional
molecular biology and biochemical approaches. Virus-free systems confirm all mechanisms. The selective forces
(dependence on host replication factors and a tropism for sun-exposed cells) that make it advantageous for β-
HPV to disrupt cell cycle regulation and DNA repair are not unique to β-HPV. Thus, p300 inactivation by other
novel cutaneous viruses would be a good marker of oncogenic potential. The overall goal of this study is to
understand the mutagenic potential of p300 destabilization to improve risk assessment of emerging viruses.
More specific to β-HPV, the expected results have preventative implications as the current FDA-approved HPV
vaccine technology could be adapted to target β-HPV and β-HPV specific inhibitors could be developed and
added to formulations used to block UV light (e.g. sunscreen)."
10915477,"Project Summary – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core of the Core Center for Clinical Research (CCCR) for Improving Minority Health in
Rheumatic Diseases (IMHeaRD) at the Medical University of South Carolina provides leadership and
management for the center and a pilot projects program that is funded entirely with institutional commitments.
The mission of this CCCR is to advance knowledge with respect to the clinical care and health outcomes of Black
patients who have, or who are at risk of developing, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma and other
debilitating rheumatic diseases. The overarching goals of the Administrative Core are to: (a) ensure the quality,
validity, accessibility and applicability of the tools, services, samples, data and other output of the CCCR cores,
(b) foster interactions among basic, translational and clinical scientists at MUSC and beyond to focus effectively
on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic diseases, (c) facilitate appropriate dissemination of research
results and resources, and (d) establish/continue collaborations with other CCCRs/CORTS to share best
practices, methodology and unique skills. To achieve these goals, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1.
Provide leadership for the CCCR; 2. Coordinate and manage CCCR organizational, operational and financial
functions and evaluative activities; 3. Leverage institutional infrastructure resources; 4. Conduct a multi-year
Evaluation Plan; 5. Strengthen and expand robust communication, dissemination and outreach activities,
fostering mutually productive interactions among health professionals, scientists and local communities; and 6.
Provide a competitive Pilot Projects Program. This core will be directed by Jim Oates, MD, with assistance from
two Associate Directors, Gary Gilkeson, MD, and Diane Kamen, MD, an Executive Committee that includes core
leaders and Research Community representatives, an Internal Advisory Committee that includes institutional
stakeholders and patient advocates, and an External Advisory Committee that includes experts in the field with
experience leading other NIAMS centers. The Administrative Core staff provides administrative support for the
center, administering and monitoring the finances, coordinating meetings and action items, and interfacing with
NIAMS staff and institutional personnel. The Administrative Core also supports educational and dissemination
activities to enhance the visibility and impact of the center within MUSC and the local community and provide a
forum for communicating and exchanging research ideas. The Administrative Core nurtures a vibrant, interactive
program of clinical and translational research to advance our knowledge and resources for improving the
prevention, diagnosis, treatment and health outcomes for rheumatic diseases, notably systemic lupus
erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, which occur significantly more often and with greater severity in Black
patients than in other racial and ethnic groups in the United States."
10915480,"Project Summary – Methodologic Core
Addressing racial disparities in rheumatic diseases as complex as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic
sclerosis requires interdisciplinary approaches that involve strong methodological components. The overarching
objectives of the CCCR Methodologic Core are to enhance the quality of research conducted by investigators in
the CCCR Research Community and to provide leadership on investigations relevant to minority health in
rheumatic diseases. To achieve these objectives within the CCCR, the Methodologic Core has 4 aims: 1) provide
quantitative guidance to the CCCR Research Community; 2) conduct research to develop novel biostatistics
methods; 3) participate in educational development of clinical and translational investigators; and 4) serve as
liaisons between the CCCR Research Community and other quantitative experts. The Core is comprised of four
PhD faculty with expertise in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and epidemiology, all of whom have a strong track
record of collaboration with rheumatologists, clinically-relevant methods development, and education. Through
interactions with our CTSA program and other important resources, the Core will also be able to leverage
additional expertise as needed. By achieving these aims through innovative techniques, the Methodologic Core
will help continue to ensure that MUSC is a leading entity in rheumatologic research."
10915481,"Project Summary – Clinical and Community Resource Core
The Clinical and Community Resource Core will build on the strong foundation established by the P60-funded
MCRC Patient Resource Core and the subsequent P30-funded Clinical and Community Resource (CCR) Core.
Since 2012 these cores have served a local, national, international, and corporate base by providing a well
phenotyped longitudinal cohort of predominantly Black systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic
sclerosis (SSc) patients and matched control and family member data and banked biological samples. The
improvements of the CCR Core have accelerated research among the expanding base by providing well
phenotyped specimens and data. A recent formal survey of the research base indicated a strong ongoing need
for existing services but expansion of services in critical areas. The proposed aims will continue the foundation
provided by the current CCCR infrastructure in a rigorous and transparent fashion. However, the renewed
Clinical and Community Resource Core (CCR Core) will flexibly expand services by 1) enhancing the informatics
infrastructure for remote consenting and survey completion, recruiting, health record data and text capture, and
reporting and 2) broadening sample collection to include a Living Biobank approach to just in time specimen
collection at any clinical laboratory encounter as well as MUSC Health sites across the state. Importantly, we
also have built strong relationships with the lay community. Because this community can inform research design,
improve enrollment and benefit from the knowledge of core personnel, the new CCR Core will continue
community engagement consultation services. The core’s specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand the CCR
Core with novel EHR, data mart, and reporting infrastructure to provide a well phenotyped, longitudinal cohort of
SLE and SSc subjects and matched control volunteers to support the current and future needs of the research
base. 2) Maintain and expand the CCR Core with novel EHR and Living BioBank infrastructure to efficiently
provide well phenotyped, banked and fresh biological specimens, both from within and beyond the longitudinal
cohort, based on the needs of the research base. 3) Provide resources to link communities impacted by SLE
and SSc and investigators. We will facilitate the engagement of community members and organizations into the
research process at every step, from project planning to dissemination and health promotion. 4) Provide
consultative & regulatory support to current and future projects of the research base. The overall goal of these
aims is to responsively expand the services of the Core to meet the needs of the research base. With an
expanding base, rigorous project management and quality control reporting and responses will be implemented
and maintained. No other resource can provide fine phenotype data and samples from this unique population of
patients. The community engagement facilitated by the core can increase the relevance of research performed
by the base as well as its translation to a community of SLE and SSc patients with known health disparities."
10915487,"Core A provides scientific leadership that meets the EKS NICHD’s overarching mission for the IDDRCs to
advance the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and amelioration of intellectual and developmental disabilities
(IDD). Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC has a well-established operational structure and function that
includes continuously evaluating its leadership and oversight to meet the needs of the changing landscape of
IDD research. As such, Core A’s services have proactively evolved in a manner that has progressed with
technological advances over the 50 years of the VKC’s IDDRC. Because of this, the IDDRC has become a
successful model of integrated research, training, and service that results in a truly translational research
environment. For the next 5 years, the IDDRC’s overarching goal is to develop precision care for IDD by
providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into
high-impact interventions and treatment for people with IDD. To realize this goal, the leadership of the
VKC IDDRC recognize that effective administrative oversight through Core A is critical. To this end, the
primary aims of Core A are to: (1) provide scientific leadership and administrative/financial oversight of the
IDDRC’s Signature Research Project and research cores in order to effectively meet the needs of the 50
IDDRC investigators and 70 funded research projects; (2) facilitate multidisciplinary research, recruit new
researchers to IDDRC, and maintain an educational environment to engage IDDRC investigators, trainees, and
community stakeholders; and (3) communicate and disseminate IDDRC activities targeted to
diverse stakeholder audiences. These three Aims allow Core A to provide overall scientific direction and
integration for an IDD translational research program that builds on the VKC IDDRC’s strengths in
educational, behavioral, neuroscience and approaches. More specifically, Core A helps to facilitate
interdisciplinary research by: (1) recruiting new researchers to our IDDRC from existing faculty
and via faculty recruits; (2) proactively managing fiscal and other resources, including support for
innovative IDD pilot research through the IDDRC Hobbs Discovery and Director’s Strategic Priorities Grants
and managing IDDRC space and facilities; and (3) communicating and disseminating IDD-related findings
to the broad IDD stakeholder community. Effective communications to local researchers and other
professionals combined with outstanding lay-friendly communication with the public and disability community is
a hallmark of the VKC IDDRC. Over the next 5 years, we build upon the existing excellent IDDRC
communication services to maximize targeted audience uptake by engaging stakeholders throughout the
process and incorporating dissemination and implementation science methods.

10915489,"The Clinical Translational Core B will: (1) enable intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD)-related
clinical research to accelerate translational studies of the causes, associated clinical features, and new
interventions in IDD; (2) incorporate non-traditional approaches into IDD research, including pragmatic clinical
trials within learning healthcare systems and remote interventional studies and (3) enhance inclusion of IDD
populations into ongoing (non-IDD) research studies by providing investigative teams with the necessary tools
and trainings to support these populations. These efforts will facilitate inclusion of people with IDD into ongoing
clinical and translational research, especially in studies from which they have previously been excluded. The
Core’s services include (1) hands-on support to IDDRC research teams in the form of targeted consultations
that tailor “condition-agnostic” Vanderbilt resources such as the
Recruitment Innovation Center, which
implements recruitment and retention strategies for clinical trials, to the needs of IDD populations; (2)
maintenance and expansion of two research registries, one for autism spectrum disorder and one for Down
syndrome; (3) consultation on data pulls for electronic health records and genetic databanks; (4) various
methods to enable remote research, including online research portals and telehealth research approaches;
and (5) hands-on support to non-IDD research teams to enhance inclusion in studies, including modifying
Electronic Consent (eConsent) for IDD populations. These services are both responsive to investigator needs
as well as generative in adding value to IDD research locally and nationwide, via dissemination through
national networks. Overall, Core B’s services are focused on encouraging non-traditional researchers (e.g.
those not working on IDD) to become engaged in IDD research; enables research involving non-traditional
participants (e.g. people with IDD typically excluded from ongoing clinical research); and facilitates the use of
non-traditional approaches (e.g. pragmatic trials, remote research) into IDD research efforts. Thus, Core B’s
activities enable IDD research to be conducted optimally from study design to recruitment/consent, to
implementation, and also expands efforts to more appropriately represent those with IDD in non-IDD ongoing
research studies. Together these activities will accelerate IDD-related discoveries that will lead to high-impact
interventions and treatments, thus improving the lives of those with IDD and families."
10915490,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the most common neurodevelopmental condition, occurring in 1 in 59
children and commonly associated with behavioral problems that include aggression, irritability, and self-injury
that are highly disabling to children with ASD and their families. While behavioral approaches are sometimes
effective for these problems, they are may not be readily accessible to all families, are usually not covered in
older individuals, and may not provide complete benefit to some people with ASD. These issues leads to the
use of pharmacological intervention, often with atypical antipsychotics (ATAP) such as risperidone or
aripiprazole. These two ATAPs are FDA approved to treat severe behavior disturbances such as aggression
and irritability in ASD, and while ATAPs can be effective, these drugs are associated with increased weight
gain, with a high risk of developing obesity. Understanding the clinical and genetic predictors of weight gain,
and the differential effects of the most commonly used ATAPs on weight gain, is critical to improving the health
of individuals with ASD. The objective of the Research Project is to address the need for precision use of
ATAPs in ASD. Our Specific Aims will: (1) develop an electronic health record (EHR) based predictive model of
atypical antipsychotic (ATAP)-induced weight gain in ASD, using a large and unique de-identified institutional
database; (2) identify pharmacogenetic risk factors associated with ATAP-induced weight gain in ASD
harnessing existing genetic information linked to the EHR; and (3) compare rates of ATAP-induced weight gain
in children with ASD randomized to one of two FDA-approved ATAPs via a pragmatic trial that will take place in
an outpatient clinic setting. Other innovative aspects of the pragmatic trial include the use of a modified
electronic consent to decrease participant/caregiver burden, the incorporation of EHR embedded health
measures to increase trial efficiency, and inclusion of a caregiver-reported outcome, the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist – Irritability scale, embedded in the EHR. To accomplish these Aims, we will (1) Use machine
learning methods to develop predictive modeling of ATAP-induced weight gain; (2) Estimate the contribution of
genetic data to ATAP-induced weight gain, and (3) carry out a pragmatic clinical trial in children with ASD
requiring ATAP treatment. The Research Project is a key element of our IDDRC renewal through its interaction
with the IDDRC Cores, particularly the Clinical Translational Core which will manage the pragmatic trial, the
Data Science Core, which will analyze resulting data, and the Administrative Core, which will promote
dissemination efforts as well as stakeholder involvement in the design and conduct of the pragmatic trial. It
addresses three focus areas within the parent RFA: (1) Interventions and Management of Co-morbid Mental
Health Conditions; (2) Innovative Technologies to Improve Assessments, Interventions, and Outcomes for
Those with IDD; and (3) Outcome Measures or Biomarkers for Interventions or Treatments."
10914982,"ABSTRACT
My previous work showed specific mutations in mRNAs activate initiation at non-canonical start codons (e.g.,
GUG, ACG) resulting in expression of neurotoxic proteins that cause multiple human disorders. However, non-
canonical translation is not restricted to atypical start codons or necessarily connected to pathology; cells rely
on alternative mechanisms to respond to specific states to translate mRNAs with spatiotemporal precision. Our
basic understanding of non-canonical translation is incomplete, and the long-term goal of this research
program is to understand how and why non-canonical translation occurs in cells. We will fill gaps in our
understanding of non-canonical initiation by addressing two fundamental questions. What mechanisms enable
alternative initiation factors to support translation? Which aminoacyl tRNAs other than Met-tRNAiMet are used
for initiation? Our previous and current work has also discovered unconventional translational regulatory
mechanisms that use ribosome queuing and non-canonical RNA-binding domains (ncRBDs). We will establish
how unconventional regulatory mechanisms such as ribosome queuing are used as cellular sensors of
elongation to drive apoptosis, and how proteins with ncRBDs regulate translation. My research program will
shed new light on how the translation machinery is used to create a diverse repertoire of initiation and
regulatory mechanisms. In doing so, we will expand our understanding of the coding potential of the genome
and how alterations in protein synthesis lead to human disease."
10914782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Therapeutic resistance is a major contributor to high lethality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A
prominent feature of PDAC is desmoplasia, the formation of fibrous tissue that not only plays a critical role in
reducing drug perfusion but also in limiting anti-tumor immune cell infiltration and function. The fibrous tissue is
primarily composed of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components hyaluronan (HA) and collagen (CN). Previous
methods to target these major ECM components have caused severe systemic side effects in patients and, thus,
finding a safe, effective approach to disrupt the PDAC ECM and improve drug delivery remains a critical unmet
need. Our long-term goal is to develop tumor-specific, microbial-based agents that express functional ECM-
degrading enzymes. This novel strategy will remediate tumor desmoplasia, minimize systemic toxicity, and
maximize the penetration and efficacy of therapeutics against primary PDAC tumors, as well as distal
metastases. The objective of this proposal is to determine the utility of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium
(ST)-based agents, engineered to express the ECM-degrading enzymes hyaluronidase (ST-HAse) and
collagenase (ST-CNase), in triggering collapse of dense tumor stroma and in enhancing therapeutic efficacy in
clinically-relevant models of PDAC. The rationale underlying this proposal is that successful completion of these
studies will identify a feasible, tumor-targeting approach to ameliorate desmoplasia in PDAC, which will enable
anticancer agents to achieve their greatest therapeutic effects.
Our central hypothesis is that degrading both HA and CN in PDAC using tumor-specific ST vectors will induce
the greatest stromal collapse, ultimately leading to enhanced penetration and efficacy of therapeutic treatment.
This central hypothesis will be tested in relevant models of PDAC by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Determine
the effect of dual ST-HAse/CNase treatment on the antitumor efficacy of standard-of-care chemotherapy; (2)
Determine the impact of dual ST-HAse/CNase treatment on efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy;
and (3) Develop and characterize recombinant STs expressing HAse and CNase under tumor-inducible
promoters.
The use of tumor-colonizing ST and tumor-inducible bacterial promoters to express ECM-degrading enzymes is
an innovative strategy to limit the effects of stromal degradation to tumor tissues. Furthermore, simultaneously
degrading HA and CN will result in greater tumor permeability than targeting either component alone. The results
of this work will have a significant impact for PDAC patients, because it is predicted to yield an agent(s) that
can, in the short-term, be optimized for manufacturing and Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and,
in the long-term, become a first-in-class, microbial-based agent used to significantly improve drug permeability
of desmoplastic primary and metastatic tumors that are inaccessible to conventional therapy."
10914784,"PROJECT SUMMARY: There were >34,000 PCa-related deaths in 2020 in the US alone. Definitive treatment
includes Radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT) with long term androgen-suppression therapy (ADT).
These have been shown to be effective treatments for organ-confined PCa and have been demonstrated to
reduce the risk of death from PCa. In 38-52% of cases, however, advanced disease with potentially poor
prognosis is found on tissue pathology. A number of recent clinical trials have shown the benefit of adjuvant
therapy in select PCa patients post-RP or RT. However, it is critical to identify those PCa patients who following
definitive therapy (surgery or radiation) are at high-risk for recurrence or metastasis and thus will benefit from
adjuvant therapy versus patients who will not and hence may be spared the morbidity and cost of therapy.
 Recognizing the significance of this unmet clinical need, in 2018 the NCCN guidelines for PCa were
modified to include the Decipher Score, a prognostic molecular gene-based test to identify the likelihood of
metastasis following surgery. We have developed our own ""Integrated Risk Score"" (IRiS) image classifier that
(npj Precison Onc, In Press14) combines computer extracted morphologic glandular features from H&E tissue
slides of the tumor. IRiS stratified PCa patients (N>900, 6 sites) based on their time to biochemical recurrence
(BCR) into low- and high-risk groups (p<0.001; HR=2.44). Further, IRiS when combined with pre-op PSA and
Gleason grade outperformed Decipher in predicting BCR in N=173 patients (p<0.001; HR=3.23 vs HR=2.76).
 In this R01, we will validate IRiS as (1) prognostic of BCR and risk of metastasis as well as (2)
predictive of the added benefit of additional chemotherapy following definitive therapy (surgery or radiation) in
PCa. In a recent paper in Clin Cancer Res, we identified IRiS specific prognostic features for African American
(AA) men with PCa. We will build on these findings to develop population specific IRiS models for PCa. We will
also further optimize IRiS by including (1) features of stromal and cribriform morphology, (2) develop population
specific IRiS models for different ethnic groups, and (3) complement IRiS with clinico-pathological features. To
validate IRiS as predictive of benefit of adjuvant therapy, we need access to randomized clinical trial tissue slide
images involving PCa patients treated with definitive therapy alone (surgery or ADT+radiation) and definitive
therapy+ adj. chemo. The STAMPEDE and RTOG-0521 trials fit these criteria; we have secured approval to
access tissue slide images from these trials. To make the tool widely available, IRiS will be integrated into
PathPresenter, a digital pathology viewer and management platform currently in use in 178 countries. This
partnership will combine expertise in (a) computational pathology of the Madabhushi group, (2) clinical,
pathological and biomarker expertise of PCa from the University of Pennsylvania (Drs. Priti Lal) and (3) GU
medical oncology expertise from the Cleveland Clinic (Dr Shilpa Gupta) to translate IRiS as the first tissue non-
destructive prognostic and predictive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for PCa."
10914785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical decision support (CDS) tools are pervasive and can “nudge” clinicians to make the best decisions easy,
yet currently lead to minimal improvements in patient outcomes. Although often ignored, consideration of
contextual factors and minimizing irrelevant information improves CDS outcomes. To minimize irrelevance,
currently existing, ‘traditional CDS’ are often designed to be patient-specific, but are not tailored to clinicians. For
example, traditional CDS address common prescribing misconceptions that are not relevant for all clinicians.
However, prescribing patterns could be used to determine whether prescribing misconceptions might exist and
then conditionally present information within a ‘personalized CDS’ to address a specific clinician’s
misconceptions; thereby minimizing irrelevance and alert fatigue. A ‘personalized CDS’ could substantially
improve guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) for the many suboptimally treated patients with
heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
 Aim 1: Design and build prototypes of traditional and personalized CDS to address common
 misconceptions of GDMT for HFrEF. We will create a personalized and traditional CDS prototype for 4
 categories of GDMT: beta blockers, sacubitril/valsartan, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and
 sodium/glucose cotransport 2 inhibitors. Clinicians will prioritize the misconceptions to address. The traditional
 CDS will address all prioritized misconceptions, while the personalized CDS will conditionally address the
 misconceptions based on clinician-specific prescribing patterns. To account for contextual factors, we will use
 the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to guide design and usability testing.
 Aim 2: Pilot the traditional and personalized CDS tools in real-world care settings.
 Aim 3: Compare the traditional and personalized CDS in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
 Cardiology and primary care clinics at one health system will be cluster-randomized. We will use sequential
 mixed methods and PRISM evaluation metrics to compare the two CDS tools. Quantitative outcomes include
 reach, adoption and effectiveness of prescribing. We will interview 15 frontline clinicians and 5 leaders to 1)
 identify PRISM factors influencing implementation outcomes, and 2) plan for external dissemination.
This proposal was designed to address my training gaps: 1) EHR architecture, 2) behavioral economics/nudges,
and 3) pragmatic trial design. Completion of this proposal will ensure my development into an independent
investigator that leverages implementation science to create innovative CDS solutions that consistently and
effectively optimize GDMT for HFrEF across health systems. This research is significant because it has the
potential to substantially improve GDMT and outcomes for high-risk patients with HFrEF. Our innovative,
personalized CDS challenges the status quo of “one size fits all” CDS by individualizing CDS to both patients
and clinicians; a paradigm-shift that will have far-reaching influence on CDS development and GDMT."

10915400,"Abstract
Poor language skills are associated with numerous negative outcomes ranging from higher rates of tantrums
and difficulty developing friendships to school failure, contact with the justice system, and increased victimization.
Although language deficits may be noticed as early as toddlerhood, effective treatment may not begin this early
and there is relatively little time to close the language gap before these children are faced with the increased
language demands of formal education and the cumulative effects of academic struggle. For the 7-13% of
children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently
needed. This competing renewal addresses this need with a series of studies that translate basic research in
statistical learning to treatment contexts. The Statistical Learning Framework posits learners extract word
meaning and grammatical structure from the language input they receive, and the statistical structure of the input
accounts for rapid, implicit language learning. Six proposed studies translate statistical learning principles to a
treatment context. Theoretically-motivated treatment factors are tested in two groups of children with poor
language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by the very limited number of
vocabulary words that they understand and use. Preschool children with Developmental Language Disorder
(ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel studies targeting
vocabulary treatment (for Late Talkers) and morphosyntax treatment (for children with DLD) will test whether
leveraging prior learning can improve treatment methods by making learning faster and more effective. We will
also directly address the issue of non-responders (i.e., children who make limited improvement despite treatment
that is effective for others), an unaddressed problem inherent to all treatment research. We leverage our previous
findings to predict which children are highly likely to be non-responders and propose alternative treatment
methods that might assist this subset of children. These studies represent the necessary work for principled
language treatment that is supported by evidence, and can provide insights into the nature of learning in a range
of children with poor language skills."
10915691,"It is estimated that up to 22 out of every 1,000 (2.2%) individuals in the United States are Deaf and Hard of
Hearing (DHH). Unfortunately, DHH persons are highly underrepresented in the research community, making
up less than 1% of Doctorate recipients. Moreover, only 40% of DHH adults who earned doctorates did so in
the life sciences, physical sciences, or engineering compared to 78% of hearing individuals. We can find no
data on the number of DHH individuals who have obtained PhDs in biomedical informatics. We believe that
DHH are among the most underrepresented groups in the field. To address this disparity, the University of
Pittsburgh (Pitt) and Gallaudet University (GU) will partner to create the Accessible and Inclusive Biomedical
Informatics and Data Science (AIBIDS) program which is unique for its focus on empowering both DHH
students and persons from other underrepresented groups in the sciences to lead biomedical informatics and
data science research. AIBIDS is a partnership between the Pitt Department of Biomedical Informatics
Training Program, founded in 1987 and one of the strongest biomedical informatics PhD training programs in
the country, and the GU Science, Technology, Accessibility, Mathematics, and Public Health (STAMP)
program, which has been producing world-class STEM baccalaureate graduates who are DHH since 1864.
The program has two separate sites to broaden the research and mentoring opportunities for all students. By
creating a cohesive program that allows students to either site, regardless of hearing status (GU is a bilingual
ASL-English campus), the AIBIDS program will increase the inclusion and accessibility of biomedical
informatics and data science research. Specific Aim 1: Provide authentic, accessible, and inclusive mentored
research internships with experienced faculty and near-peer mentors to a highly diverse group of
undergraduate and Masters level students. Specific Aim 2: Refine and develop curricula to support the
academic, scientific, and professional development of students throughout the summer through continuous
engagement. We hypothesize that the AIBIDS program will empower both DHH students and persons from
other underrepresented groups in the sciences to seek PhDs in biomedical informatics and data science
where they will drive the next generation of research questions and lead advances that benefit human health.
The AIBIDS program will apply rigorous evaluation methods to measure the progress of participating students
towards advanced biomedical informatics careers in industry and academia. The program will also measure
and track participating students’ perception of the program’s inclusiveness, the accessibility of mentoring and
educational activities, and the cultural awareness of faculty."
10915402,"Synchrotron small angle X-ray fiber diffraction is the method of choice for obtaining structural and physiological
information in the same experiment from active muscle. Experimental questions addressed range from basic
biophysical questions regarding mechanisms of force production and regulation to increasingly pre-clinical
questions relating structure to functional phenotype in animal models for cardiomyopathies and skeletal muscle
disease as well as human muscle biopsies. Critical barriers to progress, however, has been the lack of robust,
user-friendly tools for data reduction and computational tools for modeling diffraction patterns that can be used
as an aid to interpret the data. In Aim 1 we propose to further develop the MuscleX software package as a
highly automated data-reduction suite for small-angle fiber diffraction patterns from striated muscle. We will
use artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to greatly increase efficiency, reduce influence of operator bias and
improve reproducibility. New functionality will include global diffuse background subtraction using “deep
learning”, the ability to analyze multiple superimposed diffraction patterns, autoindexing and automatic
integration of diffraction peaks and unsampled layer lines. Robustness and reproducibility of code will be
improved with rigorous testing and validation procedures. In Aim 2 we propose to develop a new tool,
MUSICO-X for predicting two-dimensional X-ray diffraction patterns from striated muscle. MUSICO-X will be a
new extension module for the multi-scale simulation package MUSICO that predicts small-angle X-ray fiber
diffraction patterns simultaneously with the physiological data as a novel “forward problem” approach to
extracting maximal information from static and dynamic time resolved X-ray fiber diffraction experiments on
striated muscle. This new module will assign electron densities to components of the sarcomere using
predicted molecular positions from MUSICO to predict simulated diffraction patterns that are tested and refined
against representative X-ray diffraction and physiological data sets. These proposed software developments
are broadly applicable to all muscle systems without a specific disease focus, and would not be fundable
through usual mechanisms at NIAMS or HLBI. The availability of robust, user friendly data reduction code will
increase the efficiency and reproducibility data from muscle fiber diffraction experiments on muscle. The
proposed new simulation tool, encompassing both the structure and function of muscle, will provide a potent
hypothesis generation and testing tool that can greatly increase the value of past, present, and future X-ray
diffraction experiments on muscle."

Tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) is a post-translational modiﬁcation that can regulate protein function and interac-
tions. Tyrosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of
phosphorylation on protein function and within biochemical networks will be paramount to identifying therapeutic
interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, much of tyrosine phosphorylation is referred to as the “dark phosphopro-
teome”, because we either cannot detect it or we do not understand what its role is in regulating proteins and
networks. The dark phosphoproteome exists as a result of limitations in tools for testing and measuring pTyr
within proteins and networks. In previous work, we developed a synthetic toolkit that has superior yields of phys-
iologically relevant tyrosine phosphorylation on proteins of interest, compared to existing approaches. The goal
of this work is to: 1) harden this technology for increased reproducibility and ﬂexibility and 2) extend this technol-
ogy to produce reagents, at a fraction of their current cost, for use in quantitative measurement and monitoring
of phosphotyrosine sites in mass spectrometry-based workﬂows relevant to cancer progression and treatment
response."
10908988,"There are more than 420,000 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis therapy in the United States, which
is estimated to rise to over 500,000 patients by 2020. There are an estimated 45,500 veterans receiving
hemodialysis, of which over 3,000 enrolled veterans were receiving dialysis at VA facilities in FY 2013. Over
the last decade, there have been no therapies proven to significantly lower the mortality and morbidity risk for
these patients. One of the most important determinants of this poor clinical outcome is protein energy wasting,
a highly prevalent nutritional and metabolic abnormality characterized by increased protein breakdown in the
skeletal muscle compartment. Our group has shown that two well-recognized and interrelated metabolic
abnormalities, insulin resistance and persistent inflammation, are likely to play a critical role in the
pathogenesis of protein energy wasting and related nutritional and metabolic abnormalities. Our preliminary
data show that in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients 1) There is an inadequate response to protein
anabolic actions of insulin; 2) Persistent systemic inflammation is strongly and independently associated with
skeletal muscle net protein balance; and 3) Pharmacological modulation of systemic inflammation and insulin
resistance partially, but not fully, reverse net protein catabolism. It was demonstrated that non-osmotic sodium
(Na) is stored in skin and muscle without commensurate water retention, which leads to local immune-cell
activation and accelerated pro-inflammatory status. Our preliminary data show that the skin and muscle Na+
contents, derived by 23Na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are substantially higher in MHD patients
compared to matched healthy controls. We also showed that increased skin and muscle Na concentrations
are significantly associated with increased inflammatory response and decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity,
in patients on MHD. These data suggest that tissue Na content, immune pathways and insulin resistance are
closely linked and could lead to increased risk for protein energy wasting in MHD patients. It was reported that
standard 4-hour conventional hemodialysis provides significant Na removal from muscle and skin suggesting
that tissue Na and water content could be modulated by modulating hemodialysis prescription. The overall goal
of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms by which tissue sodium accumulation, persistent immune
system activation and insulin resistance influence the development of protein energy wasting in MHD patients.
We hypothesize that the skin and muscle tissue sodium accumulation is a critical mechanism by which chronic
inflammatory response and insulin resistance, alone or in combination, lead to protein energy wasting in MHD
patients. Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that excessive Na accumulation in the skeletal muscle and
skin leads to local and systemic inflammation that result in resistance to metabolic effects of insulin in MHD
patients. We will achieve this aim by examining tissue Na content and net protein balance (primary outcome),
markers of inflammation and macronutrient (glucose and amino acid) disposal rates and in 60 MHD patients
and 30 frequency matched age, gender, race and body mass index controls without kidney disease. Specific
Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that removal of tissue sodium by modulating hemodialysis prescription would
improve metabolic milieu and protein energy wasting in MHD patients. We will achieve this goal through a
cross-over randomized clinical trial whereby dialysate sodium concentrations will be modulated (138 mEq/L
versus 132 mEq/L, 4 weeks each) to remove 10% of baseline skeletal muscle Na content in the setting of
stable sodium intake by diet. Our primary outcomes will be markers of net protein balance, inflammation, and
macronutrient disposal rates. If successful, our proposed studies will have great potential to influence clinical
practices in MHD patients because the proposed intervention protocol would be easily accessible and could
ultimately lead to improvements in the hospitalization and death rates with great impact on Veterans' Health
Care and make important contributions to the research mission of the Department of Veterans Administration."
10909043,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The discovery of antibiotics from soil microbes is widely regarded as one of the most significant achievements
in modern medicine, enabling many important medical procedures including surgery and cancer
chemotherapy. However, antibiotic resistance is approaching such a critical level that we are facing an eminent
public health disaster where many significant medical advancements may no longer be possible. There is an
urgent need to develop and/or discover novel classes of antibiotics, especially antibiotics that are active
against high-priority Gram-negative pathogens. Natural products have served as the scaffold for the vast
majority of our current antibiotics, and recent advances in genomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics clearly
indicate that there is still a vast wealth of biosynthetic potential encoded in bacterial genomes that could
produce novel antibiotics. Unfortunately, identifying a novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in a genome
provides us with very little information about the chemical nature of the natural product it might produce. Thus,
the field of natural product discovery, and consequently the field of antibiotic discovery, faces two major
obstacles: how do we quickly and efficiently identify strains that have the potential to produce desirable novel
compounds from “silent” BGCs and then how do we consistently induce the expression of these BGCs to
characterize the compounds they produce. The induction of silent BGCs that produce antibiotics is likely
context or community dependent, especially given the self-harming effects of antimicrobial compounds. Our
previous work has validated a method for identifying microbes that produce antimicrobial compounds from
silent BGCs, and this proposal describes methods for optimizing single- and mixed-culture fermentation
conditions to consistently produce these compounds. In the research aims, we propose two complementary
approaches to develop reproducible and scalable fermentation conditions that can broadly stimulate silent
antibiotic production, which is often a rate limiting step in the field of natural products chemistry. Aim 1 will
expand on our observations that microbes increase the production of antimicrobial compounds when grown in
otherwise nutrient-limited media where complex polysaccharides are their dominant carbon source. Aim 2 will
use co-culture to manipulate microbial physiological prior to fermentation. We expect that our optimized culture
conditions will enable us to obtain natural product extracts that contain sufficient compound for feature-based
molecular networking (FBMN) analyses to dereplicate antimicrobial compounds prior to activity-guided
purification and structural elucidation of bioactive compounds (Aim 3)."
10909222,"This project’s long-term goal is to elucidate how anti-VEGF (i.e. acute neutralization of VEGF (vascular
endothelial growth factor)) stops leakage of blood vessels that are chronically exposed to excess VEGF. Anti-
VEGF’s ability to curb blood vessel permeability has improved and/or sustained the quality of life of patients
afflicted with pervasive, incurable diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), diabetic macular
edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Such clinical observations
demonstrate anti-VEGF’s efficacy, and beg the question of how anti-VEGF calms pathological blood vessels.
 We posit that chronically elevated VEGF alters gene expression in the endothelium of blood vessels in
a way that relaxes the endothelial barrier, and that anti-VEGF reverses such changes.
Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that anti-VEGF acts transcriptionally to close the barrier.
Our preliminary data reveal that prolonged exposure to VEGF changes the expression of many genes,
including those that encode known regulators of the endothelial cell barrier. These discoveries support our
work hypothesis that anti-VEGF acts transcriptionally to close the barrier. This hypothesis will be tested as
follows. The initial, RNAseq-based phase will compare the gene expression profile in cells that have or have
not been treated with anti-VEGF and thereby identify anti-VEGF differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
Candidates DEGs will be prioritized based on their known function, and then their contribution to VEGF-/anti-
VEGF-mediated control of barrier function will be determined. We will identify genes that anti-VEGF depends
on to close the endothelial cell barrier that has been breached with VEGF.
Aim 2. Investigate the mechanism of action of anti-VEGF on patient-derived retinal endothelial cells.
Aim 1 will be done with primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) from a healthy adult donor. Aim 2 will
be a repeat of aim 1, except using PRECs, retinal endothelial cells isolated from pathological blood vessels
that develop in patients with PDR. This is the target cell type of anti-VEGF therapy. Determining the
mechanism of action of anti-VEGF in these cells will provide clinically relevant information.
Aim 3. Determine how anti-VEGF calms pathological blood vessels in patients.
In aim 3 we will learn how anti-VEGF acts in patients by comparing the gene expression profile in freshly
isolated endothelium from pathological blood vessels of treatment naïve and anti-VEGF-treated patients. In
addition, we will compare the results from all 3 aims to determine which of the anti-VEGF-mediated effects that
occur in patients are faithfully modeled by anti-VEGF treatment of cultured PRECs (aim 2) or HRECs (aim 1).
 This project will unveil the molecular mediators of anti-VEGF’s therapeutic benefit. Such information will
remove current roadblocks to developing biomarkers and alternatives to anti-VEGF, which are needed to
address the needs of patients afflicted with a variety of blinding conditions such as DME, PDR and nAMD."
10910014,"In the event of a radiation disaster or attack, high dose radiation exposure to humans causes Acute Radiation
Syndrome (ARS). The hematopoietic system and gastrointestinal (GI) tract are among the most vulnerable
tissues to radiation injury due to the presence of cycling stem cells that are sensitive to radiation. Loss of
regenerative capacity in these organs leads to lethal toxicity. For example, damage to the bone marrow from
total body irradiation leads to the hematopoietic syndrome. High doses of radiation to the abdomen results in
GI syndrome characterized by damage to the intestinal epithelium, loss of mucosal barrier, and sepsis. While,
medical countermeasures to mitigate the hematopoietic syndrome are available, there are currently no FDA
approved therapies to mitigate the GI syndrome.
We have demonstrated that p53 mediated expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 in GI epithelial cells is
critical for survival of the GI syndrome. High p21 expression prevents damaged cells from progressing through
mitosis and succumbing to mitotic catastrophe. In contrast, radiation kills p21-low, fast cycling LGR5+ GI stem
cells in the base of the crypts. When these cells are lost, regeneration of the intestinal epithelium is dependent
on a slow-cycling, and thus radioresistant, cell population that resides higher in the crypt. Therefore, identifying
the GI epithelial cell type that is preserved by high p21 expression and capable of supporting tissue
regeneration following injury will be important for developing mitigation strategies for GI syndrome.
Recently published single cell RNA sequencing data from irradiated small intestine epithelial cells in mice
identified Clu+ revival stem cells as slow cycling cells with high p21 levels that survive 24 hours and proliferate
after high dose irradiation. Clu+ cells are capable of regenerating LGR5+ stem cells after injury and loss of this
cell type sensitizes mice to GI syndrome lethality. Clu+ cells rely on the Yap1/Hippo signaling axis for
maintenance and therefore we hypothesize that modulation of this pathway will mitigate the GI syndrome. In
addition, Dclk1+ tuft cells were also identified to have high p21 expression and survive high dose radiation.
These cells are chemosensory and secretory cells that support renewal of the GI epithelium following
irradiation by maintaining the stem cell niche. We hypothesize that p53 regulation of p21 in these cell types is
critical to intestinal recovery following radiation injury and that targeting these cells for mitigation is a promising
strategy. We propose to dissect the mechanisms by which Clu+ revival stem cells and Dclk1+ tuft cells function
to promote renewal of the GI epithelium after radiation injury using sophisticated genetically engineered mouse
models. We will use targeted approaches with small molecule drugs in vivo and CRISPR/Cas9 screening
methods in organoid cultures to identify novel mitigator targets that function specifically in these cell types to
reduce lethal GI toxicity."
10910028,"Project Summary
In response to stimulation by type I interferon (IFN-I), STAT2 is phosphorylated by JAK tyrosine kinases and
then binds to phosphorylated STAT1 and IRF9 to form ISGF3, which drives the transcriptional response. This
canonical function of STAT2 is indispensable for the biological responses to IFN-I, which are cytostatic and also
lead to the activation of anti-tumor immunity in cancer cells. Consequently, STAT2 has been assumed to help
suppress cancer progression and enhance therapy. However, this original view of STAT2 is challenged by
several new lines of evidence that reveal a previously unknown pro-tumor impact of STAT2. A higher level of
STAT2 expression is associated with a worse prognosis in lung cancer and an aggressive phenotype in breast
cancer, and STAT2 deficiency protects mice from chemically induced skin and colon cancer. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying these pro-tumor activities of STAT2 are not yet well understood. Helping to
bridge this gap, we have identified two novel non-canonical, pro-tumor activities of STAT2 that do not require
tyrosine phosphorylation. First, STAT2 lacking phosphorylation of Y690 (U-STAT2) forms a complex with IRF-9,
even in the absence of IFN-I stimulation. Intriguingly, unlike ISGF3, this constitutive U-STAT2:IRF9 complex
increases the expression of a set of NFκB-dependent genes, including IL-6, facilitating the development of a
mesenchymal/stem-like phenotype in lung cancer cells. Second, U-STAT2 binds to the cytosolic sensor STING,
preventing STING from stimulating IFN-I synthesis in response to DNA or synthetic agonists of cGAS. This is
the first example of a STAT2 function that is completely independent of any role in transcription. Notably, both
these non-canonical STAT2 activities are regulated by a previously unknown phosphorylation of threonine 404
in STAT2 (T403 in mice), which promotes the formation of U-STAT2:IRF9 and U-STAT2:STING complexes.
Consequently, elevated level of T404 phosphorylated STAT2 result in increased resistance to cisplatin in lung
cancer cells and enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Furthermore, while the level of P-T404 STAT2 in
human lung adenocarcinoma specimens correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, prevention of T403
phosphorylation by a T-to-A mutation in mice leads to better tumor control and enhanced anti-tumor immunity.
We propose that the T404 phosphorylation of U-STAT2 promotes cancer progression and resistance to therapy.
To test this hypothesis, we will determine the tumor-intrinsic roles of U-STAT2 in cancer progression and
chemoresistance; and investigate the role of the T404-regulated U-STAT2/STING complex in resistance to
immunotherapy."
10910029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Therapy failure remains an overarching clinical challenge for patients with aggressive Triple Negative Breast
Cancer (TNBC). Two important factors that regulate TNBC metastasis and recurrence are: (i) the differentiation
status of the cancer cells, and (ii) the functionality of anti-tumor immunity, both of which are highly influenced by
the tumor microenvironment (TME). We find that the TME cytokines Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) and
Interferon β (IFNβ) oppose one another in regulating both cancer cell differentiation and immune system function
in TNBC. TGFβ and its receptors are frequently upregulated in aggressive, therapy-resistant cancers, such as
TNBC. Mechanistically, we find that TGFβ effector SMAD3 cooperates with STAT3, an important effector of the
IL-6 family of cytokines, to induce stem-like/mesenchymal reprogramming, which enhances TNBC invasiveness,
tumor-initiating capacity, and therapeutic resistance. At the same time, TGFβ strongly suppresses IFNβ
production. Since IFNβ promotes a less aggressive cancer cell state and activates anti-tumor immunity, the
TGFβ-mediated suppression of IFNβ and its downstream effectors, STAT1 and STAT2, is an important
contributor to TNBC progression and immune system impairment. Importantly, restoration of IFNβ signaling
results in the reversal of TGFβ-mediated stem-like/mesenchymal program and re-engages anti-tumor immunity.
We hypothesize that the relative amounts of TGFβ and IFNβ cytokine activity in both cancer and immune cells
dictate TNBC aggressiveness and ultimately, patient outcomes. The purpose of our study is to define the
molecular mechanisms by which TGFβ and IFNβ antagonize one another in regulating stem-like/mesenchymal
reprogramming and anti-tumor immunity. Our Project has strong connections with Project 1, which will assess the
regulation of STAT2 by a novel threonine phosphorylation, and with Project 3 which will examine how TGFβ
synergizes with another pro-tumor cytokine, IL-17, to amplify the signals critical for repressing IFNβ production.
The unifying studies proposed in our Program will (i) identify common molecular mechanisms that promote the
development of resistance to chemo- and immune-therapies and (ii) assess novel therapeutic combinations
aimed at shifting the equilibrium of IFNβ and TGFβ/IL-17 signaling in the TME. By shifting this balance, we
propose to induce the differentiation of cancer cells and enhance anti-tumor immunity to increase the sensitivity
of hard-to-treat cancers to chemo- and immuno-therapy."
10910031,"Project Summary
While the relationship between chronic inflammation and cancer is well recognized, knowledge of the cellular
and molecular mechanisms that link these processes continues to evolve. Intratumoral interleukin 17A (IL-17)
levels are associated with poor prognosis for a variety of solid tumors in human. The overall goal of this
application is to investigate the mechanisms of IL-17-mediated cancer progression, focusing on tumor responses
to anti-cancer therapies. Our recent preliminary data revealed that IL-17 engages both cancer cells and tumor
microenvironment to synergistically promote cancer progression. Firstly, work supported by this award identified
a non-canonical IL-17-induced EGFR-mediated ERK5 signaling cascade critical for tumorigenesis. Our new
preliminary study revealed an Lrig1+ stem-like tumor cell population in squamous cell carcinoma that are highly
responsive to IL-17 with EGFR-ERK5 activation. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a link between IL-17-ERK5
axis in human and mouse Lrig1+ stem-like tumor cells with NRF2-mediated antioxidation and Wnt5a-dependent
induction of stemness. Lineage tracing showed that IL-17 rendered these Lrig1+ stem-like tumor cells resistance
to chemotherapy, which were also enriched by anti-PD1 treatment. Secondly, we found that canonical IL-17
signaling operates in both tumor cells and stromal cells to dictate a tumor-promoting and immune suppressive
environment. In tumor cells, IL-17 synergizes with other inflammatory cytokines to orchestrate an intratumoral
cancer promoting inflammation via the induction of specific effector molecules. In cancer-associated fibroblasts,
IL-17 signaling helps to establish an immune exclusion zone to prevent the infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Deletion
of IL-17R in CAFs rendered these tumors sensitive to immune therapy. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that canonical and non-canonical IL-17 signaling in cancer cells and CAFs coordinately drive cancer
progression and resistance to therapies. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) Investigate how IL-17R-EGFR axis
in Lrig1+ stem-like tumor cells renders resistance to anti-cancer therapies; (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which
IL-17 shapes the pro-tumor immune exclusive tumor microenvironment. Program Interactions: This Project will
be critically informed by and also provide necessary information to the other Projects in the Program at multiple
levels. Project 1 and Project 2 will investigate the antagonistic interplay between IFNβ and TGFβ in cancer cell
differentiation. Informed by those studies, we will determine whether STING-induced IFNβ can be used to
eradicate Lrig1+ cells to improve responses to anti-cancer therapies. We will take advantage of the Animal
Model, Immunotyping and Analytics Core B to standardize our in vivo analyses, including preclinical
assessment of cancer therapeutics and characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Statistical
analyses will be performed by Program Biostatistician Dr. Bo Hu and Program Bioinformatician Dr. Fulai Jin

comprised of an exceptional team with complementary expertise and responsibility to lead the core’s monitoring 
and evaluation activities. PEC members include: Drs. Kristi Holmes and Brian Hitsman from NU-LCC; Raymond 
Fuller and Dr. Wamucii Njogu from NEIU; and Drs. Timothy Johnson and Lisa Sanchez-Johnsen from UIC. This 
Renewal application for the ChicagoCHEC PEC proposes to build on the infrastructure created, program 
progress, and lessons learned from our first U54 award and continue to improve our integrated and responsive 
foundation to support planning, monitoring and evaluation. The PEC will continue to monitor progress through 
ongoing evaluation processes, maximize resources, identify novel directions for the Partnership in ongoing 
consultation with the Administrative Core, and report progress to institutional leaders and the NCI on a continual 
basis. The PEC team will work closely with the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and the Program Steering 
Committee (PSC) and is composed of two teams: The Evaluation Action Team (EvAT) and the Mentoring and 
Project Team. The decisions made by the PEC will be guided by data systematically collected and organized by 
the EvAT while the PEC’s Mentoring and Project Team will monitor the provision of support and mentorship of 
ChicagoCHEC’s early career faculty, in addition to working closely with the Administrative Core to seed 
collaborative, tri-institutional cancer research projects and developmental pilots over the next five-year grant 
period. The overall specific aims of the PEC are to: (1) Conduct ongoing tracking and evaluation of all Partnership 
activities to inform planning, improve processes, maximize resources, and communicate impact to stakeholders 
over the duration of the ChicagoCHEC Partnership, with support of the IAC, PSC, and NCI; (2) Create and 
sustain an ongoing Incubator and Catalyst Research Grant Program, encouraging tri-institutional partnership 
and a focus on cancer health equity; and (3) Bolster a pipeline of faculty focused on cancer research by 
coordinating and monitoring career enhancement, mentoring, and professional development activities for early 
career faculty."

Germline pathogenic variants (PV) in the BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 cancer predisposition genes are associated
with high risks of breast cancer (lifetime risks to age 80 of >50%), whereas PVs in ATM and CHEK2 are associated
with moderate lifetime risks of 20-25%. Of these, PVs in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2 and PALB2 are predominantly
associated with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. While much is known about ER+ breast cancer
overall, little is known about the contribution of PVs in these predisposition genes to ER+ breast cancer risks and
to the influence of these PVs on prognosis. Here we aim to address some of the important clinical questions that
remain unanswered for these ER+ breast cancer predisposition genes. In Aim #1 we propose to assess age-related
risks of cancers associated with ER+ breast cancer predisposition gene PVs. Specifically, while overall risks of
breast cancer are well established, age-related risks of breast cancer in 5-10 year categories and risks of
contralateral breast cancer are not known for the ATM, CHEK2 and PALB2 genes. In the absence of this
information the overall risks of cancer associated with PVs are of limited clinical value. We will use information from
very large population-based including targeted studies of African Americans and West Africans and from high-risk
breast cancer studies to estimate these cancer risks. In Aim #2 we propose to establish the influence of PVs in ER-
positive breast cancer predisposition genes on prognosis. It is not currently known whether breast cancers driven
by ER+ predisposition genes, other than BRCA2, display specific responses to standard therapy (such as
chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or HER2 directed therapy). We propose to screen germline DNA from
participants in large breast cancer adjuvant clinical trials for PVs in the ER+ breast cancer predisposition genes
and to assess the influence of PVs on disease free survival and overall survival in response to adjuvant therapy.
In addition, we will determine whether the PVs are correlated with the Oncotype Dx Breast Recurrence Score,
which is an effective prognostic and predictive biomarker for ER+ breast cancer patients. In Aim #3 we propose to
determine the clinical relevance of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) in ER-positive breast cancer
predisposition genes. Individuals carrying germline VUS, which are predominantly missense variants, cannot
benefit from enhanced risk assessment and cancer screening or make informed decisions about surgical
prevention or screening. We will conduct individual and high-throughput functional assay studies and apply rules-
based FDA-approved ClinGen methods for determination of the clinical relevance of many VUS in these genes."
10919811,"RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE – ABSTRACT 
The overall objective of the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) Research Education 
Core (REC) is to increase the number of students from underrepresented populations engaged in cancer 
research by fostering meaningful research, education, and community engaged experiences which link faculty 
and students of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and the Robert 
H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC). For this Core, we define students 
as high school through postdoctoral fellows. Between 2016 – 2019, the REC launched research education 
experiences bringing together diverse students across the Chicagoland area, developed curricula introducing 
students to the science of cancer disparities, and built robust networks with high school and local community 
college students to encourage their entry into REC programs. In that period, the REC provided structured 
summer research education experiences through the ChicagoCHEC Research Fellows (CHEC Fellows) 
Program to 65 students from minority and underrepresented backgrounds. The CHEC Fellows Program is an 
intensive 8-week summer program that introduces students to a breadth of cancer health disparities research 
topics and to the work of leading cancer researchers, provides hands-on engagement with community partners, 
and builds professional skills as a foundation for lifelong learning. In this renewal, we seek to sustain the 
successes of the CHEC Fellows Program and add programming to further student entry into cancer research 
trajectories and further meet the needs of students within ChicagoCHEC sponsored Projects. Thus, the CHEC 
Fellows Program will be complemented by development of new career readiness and career development 
supports, and an expansion of ChicagoCHEC Laboratory Experiences and Programs (LEaP), which matches 
students, including graduates of the CHEC Fellows Program, to intensive, one-on-one mentored immersion 
experiences in cancer research laboratories. A diverse and exceptional tri-institutional team of cancer research 
faculty has been assembled to lead the REC in achieving its specific aims, which are to: (1) develop curriculum 
and support professional development opportunities to increase Chicago area undergraduate interest and 
readiness in entering the cancer research career pipeline; (2) refine and sustain the CHEC Fellows and LEaP 
Programs for diverse undergraduate students recruited from NEIU, UIC, NU, and City Colleges of Chicago; (3) 
link underrepresented students (undergraduates, graduate/medical students and postdoctoral fellows) to 
mentored cancer research experiences within ChicagoCHEC Projects and provide career development support; 
and (4) implement continuous tracking and program evaluation. Initiatives of the ChicagoCHEC REC will directly 
introduce students to cancer research and enhance their capacity to seek out opportunities that will enable them 
to pursue meaningful, highly effective careers in this field."
10919856,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in premenopausal women (pre-MW)
worldwide and its incidence is increasing in developed countries. BCs in pre-MW are more likely to be of an
aggressive intrinsic subtype, higher grade, and advanced stage compared to BCs in post-MW. Pre-MW with
ER+/HER2- BC are commonly treated with chemotherapy (CT), endocrine therapy (ET) and ovarian function
suppression (OFS). Long-term data from the SOFT and TEXT adjuvant trials demonstrated that aromatase
inhibitors (AI)+OFS improved disease free survival but have yet to improve overall survival (OS), compared to
tamoxifen (TAM) or TAM+OFS. Furthermore, in one study (ABCSG 12), AI+OFS led to worse OS compared to
TAM+OFS. The lack of a survival benefit in these studies may relate to the detrimental side-effects of premature
menopause (PM), known to be associated with higher rates of cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis and death. Therefore, alternative endocrine strategies for pre-MW with ER+/HER2-
BC are critically needed, especially for pre-MW who cannot tolerate OFS. Endoxifen (ENDX) is an active TAM
metabolite, and the PI’s have led the development of ENDX as a novel ET for BC. Through completion of phase
I and II trials, we have demonstrated that ENDX is safe, well-tolerated, has substantial oral bioavailability and is
superior to TAM in endocrine therapy (ET) resistant BC. Furthermore, the PI’s have identified a novel mechanistic
basis for the superior anti-cancer effects of ENDX; namely, the novel ENDX target, PKCβI. Here, we build upon
this foundation by performing a prospective neoadjuvant endocrine study comparing ENDX without OFS vs
AI+OFS in the neoadjuvant treatment of pre-MW with ER+/HER2- BC. We will also extensively study the roles
of PKCβI in mediating ENDX efficacy, given our preliminary data demonstrating that ENDX uniquely binds PKCβI
and targets it for proteasomal degradation, resulting in downregulation of ERα, cyclin D1, and E2F1 protein levels
concurrent with marked inhibition of BC cell proliferation. Importantly, these effects are not observed with PKCβI
kinase inhibitors, suggesting novel non-kinase related functions of PKCβI. Furthermore, they are not observed
with TAM or AI. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that ENDX is a superior ET in
part due to its ability to dually target both ER and PKCβI. We further hypothesize that the optimal treatment of
pre-MW with ER+/HER2- BC can be achieved using ENDX monotherapy without the need for OFS. To test our
hypotheses, we will 1) develop ENDX for pre-MW with ER+/HER2- BC; 2) elucidate the mechanisms by which
PKCβI contributes to ENDX responsiveness in endocrine sensitive disease; and 3) determine the predictive and
prognostic value of PKCβI in ER+/HER2- BC patients treated with TAM and ENDX. Given the increasing
incidence of BC in pre-MW, along with the known morbidity associated with OFS, the proposed studies are of
critical importance towards improving the endocrine management of ER+/HER2- BC in pre-MW."
10919812,"OUTREACH CORE – ABSTRACT 
Cancer incidence and mortality rates for racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved and vulnerable 
populations are substantially higher in Chicago than the national average for most cancers (Illinois State Cancer 
Registry). Addressing these disparities demands culturally and linguistically relevant community-driven 
approaches. In 2015, a consortium comprised of community members and three major academic institutions in 
Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and the Robert H. Lurie 
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC), secured NCI U54 funding to establish the 
Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC), which aims to foster rigorous and meaningful 
research, education, training, and community outreach/engagement to advance health equity. Through the 
original U54 award, the Outreach Core identified community needs, and provided leadership and programmatic 
support for community-based cancer education, engagement, and outreach activities. In this renewal, the 
proposed activities of the ChicagoCHEC Outreach Core will build upon the existing strengths, prior and ongoing 
work, accomplishments, and lessons learned from the first U54 award to elevate ChicagoCHEC’s collective 
impact on reducing cancer inequities. A major area of the Outreach Core’s focus for the next five years will be 
to develop targeted cancer support efforts for underserved and vulnerable populations. These include the 
following non-mutually exclusive groups: people with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, men of color, and 
low-income cancer survivors. Proposed community engagement approaches span the cancer continuum, 
encompassing prevention, screening and early detection, community-based education, and cancer treatment 
and survivorship. Specific aims of the Outreach Core are to: (1) Foster community partnerships and conduct 
ongoing needs assessment to identify new and innovative areas of opportunity, including outreach research, for 
community-engaged activities that will reach individuals from health disparities populations; (2) Implement 
outreach and education activities across the cancer continuum; (3) Foster opportunities for building cancer health 
equity research capacity among community partners, faculty, and students; (4) Plan, implement, and evaluate 
NCI National Outreach Network activities locally; and (5) Rigorously evaluate achievement and progress of the 
Outreach Core’s stated aims using a comprehensive evaluation strategy. A highly effective and diverse tri- 
institutional leadership team with complementary expertise will lead these activities, supported by experienced 
Community Health Educators with strong clinical and community networks. A Community Steering Committee 
will guide the development and implementation of the proposed outreach and engagement activities. The 
Outreach Core will leverage each ChicagoCHEC partner academic institution’s numerous ties to Chicago’s 
diverse neighborhoods and community organizations in its activities collectively aimed at advancing cancer 
health equity."
10919814,"PROJECT SUMMARY ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
 The Administrative Core (AC) of NeuroTech Harbor (NTH) will direct, coordinate, and lead the Outreach,
Evaluation, Innovator, and Resource Cores to efficiently achieve the following goals: (i) Be a national leader in
the support and development of real-world solutions to neurological problems and ensure that it does so in a
way that reflects our Equitech values of inclusivity and equity in both the people involved and the projects it
supports. (ii) Act as an excellent steward of federal funds to achieve maximum return for NIH and society at
large. The AC will consist of the Governing Board, Steering Committee, and Advisory Board. The AC will serve
as a central leadership team that will continually assess, refine, and improve NTH processes to achieve better
results. NTH's AC will accomplish the following aims: (Aim 1) To ensure excellence in Governance and
Management at NTH. (Aim 2) To coordinate all NTH Core interactions with the Steering Committee (SC),
Advisory Board (AB), and Consultant Network. (Aim 3) To prepare NTH-selected meritorious innovation projects
for NIH funding consideration and ensure success of funded projects. (Aim 4) To actively communicate best
practices and collaborate across the BluePrint Hub consortium.
 We have assembled a Governing Board led by NTH PIs serving as Directors of each Core. As the founding
institutional partners of NTH, the Governing Board will be led jointly by Co-Chairmen Dean Schlesinger from
JHU and Provost Dr. Wutoh from Howard. The Governing Board will ensure that the Equitech approach of NTH
is front and center to all decisions and actions in each individual Core's plans. The AC will also act as the final
arbiter of conflicts and take action to maximize likelihood of success for NTH, Cores, and subprojects. While
Core Directors will separately manage the budgets, personnel, processes, and goals for each Core, the AC will
act as a central coordinator for all Cores to receive regular input and oversight from the SC and AB. The AC will
consider appropriate SC members for (1) Outreach Core needs assessments and NTH solicitations, and (2)
reviews with the Evaluation Core to ensure the highest impact innovation projects are selected.
 The AC team will convene an annual Governing Board meeting with key AB members to continuously identify
areas of improvement in quality, efficiency, outcomes, and responsiveness in response to the changing
landscape of medical needs, technological breakthroughs, and scientific advancements in the neurology space.
The AC will coordinate access to an external Consultant Network of experts who span a broad range of expertise
(early-stage technology, clinical translation, or business development) to assemble the Dream Tech Team for
each innovator project. In the Innovator Core will support innovators with the guidance and resources necessary
for building solutions for optimal real-world impact. The AC will be responsible for coordinating interactions with
NIH BluePrint (BP) program staff on strategic planning. In addition, the AC will work with each Core's staff to
collect, analyze, and disseminate our outcomes and best practices to the BP network."
10921894,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
For more than two decades, with the support of NIH and of the University of Puerto Rico -Medical Sciences
Campus, the Caribbean Primate Research Center (CPRC) has successfully established and maintained an SPF
(Herpes B, STLV1, SRV and SIV-free) Indian-origin rhesus macaque resource and breeding colony at the Sabana
Seca Field Station (SSFS). To ensure the health of the colony, a solid Animal Care and Use Program is in place.
Mechanisms used to ensure the quality of the colony include routine monitoring by the veterinary staff, IACUC
inspections conducted every six months, USDA inspector visits, and AAALAC site visits every three years. The
Program is also discussed annually with the External Advisory Board (EAB). The Center complies with all federal
and local regulations related to the care and use of laboratory animals and is fully-accredited by AAALAC.The
aims fo this component are: Aim 1: To maintain the closed CPRC- SPF indian-origin rhesus macaque's colony,
at a steady state level, that can provide high quality animals to support numerous NIH funded research projects,
and to continue working toward self-sufficiency. The SPF colony will be maintained in compliance with the
regulatory bodies. Aim 2: To use the projected recovery cost income, as part of an integral financial plan, to
support the CPRC-SPF colony."
10920376,"Project Summary/Abstract
Meditation training is a promising technique that can help improve emotional health of adolescents and
facilitate treatment of adolescent depression. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the neural
reorganization that takes place as a result of meditation training. Continued existence of this gap represents an
important problem because, until it is filled, design of more effective interventions is highly unlikely. The long-
term goal is to establish safe and effective methods of promoting emotional health in adolescents. The
objective here is to study adolescents undergoing meditation training by using MRI connectomics to map
changes in node strength (integrated connectivity) of the putamen. The putamen is a region previously
associated with meditation practice and attenuated shrinkage with age in Zen meditators on the one hand, and
with love, compassion, anticipation of pleasure, and responses to increasing intensity of happiness on the
other hand. The central hypothesis is that structural connectivity of the putamen with other brain regions will
increase in adolescents with mediation training and, in turn, positively affect their emotional health. This
innovative model is rooted in preliminary results and previous literature. The rationale for the proposed MRI
connectomics approach is that regular engagement of the putamen is expected to increase myelination of the
white matter tracks connecting it to other regions, which can be probed by using diffusion MRI. Guided by
strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims, which entail studying
changes in the putamen node strength and emotional health measured as internalizing problems and
depressive symptoms in 1) a cohort of healthy adolescents with a 12-week meditation training compared to
waitlist controls (R61 phase) and 2) a cohort of adolescents with mild to moderate depression with a 12-week
meditation training compared to waitlist controls (R33 phase). The “Go/No-Go Criterion” is a medium-large
increase of the putamen node strength observed with meditation training in healthy adolescents in the R61
phase (Cohen's d>0.6). The optimization strategy for the R33 phase is based on the fact that anhedonia
(diminished ability to experience pleasure) is a key characteristic of depression and preliminary results show
that putamen structural connectivity is lower in adolescent depression. It is therefore expected that the
mechanistic effect in the putamen will be amplified in the population of depressed adolescents, reflecting
normalization of the putamen function. The proposed research is innovative, because it uses advanced MRI
connectomics methods to map changes in brain networks of youth with meditation training and tests a novel
mechanistic model. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to greatly advance our
understanding of the neural mechanism by which meditation improves emotional health of adolescents.
Ultimately, such knowledge will inform treatment and prevention of adolescent depression."
10911301,"Project Summary
For the past decade, the population-cell Hi-C technique has significantly improved our ability to discover
genome-wide DNA proximities. However, because population Hi-C is based on a pool of cells, it will not help
us reveal each single cell's 3D genome structure or understand cell-to-cell variability in terms of 3D genome
structure and gene regulation. It is also difficult to achieve a high resolution, such as 1 Kbp, with population Hi-
C; therefore, when finding and analyzing the spatial interactions for the promoter or enhancer regions typically
associated with biologically-important regulatory elements, population Hi-C data's resolution is too low to be
useful. Moreover, while we know that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a key role in the formation of genome
3D structures, the question is whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process since
lncRNAs have been found to recruit proteins needed for chromatin remodeling, and our preliminary research
has found that lncRNA LINC00346 directly interacts with CTCF. Finally, while members of the bioinformatics
community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms to reconstruct 3D genome structures based on
population Hi-C data, important questions still must be answered regarding how 3D genome structures are
involved in gene regulation and whether there are relationships between 3D genome structures and genetic
and epigenetic features. The PI proposes to conduct leading research to overcome these challenges and
address these questions. During the next five years, the PI will develop algorithms to reconstruct the 3D whole-
genome structures for single cells and analyze cell-to-cell variabilities in terms of 3D genome structure and
gene regulation. The PI will develop a deep learning algorithm to enhance the resolution of population Hi-C
data to that of Capture Hi-C data (1 Kbp) so that we can make good use of the large amount of Hi-C data
accumulated in the past decade. An online database will be built to allow the community to access both
population and single-cell 3D genome structures in an integrated way. The PI will work with a cancer biologist
to discover any lncRNAs that function as a scaffold to fine-tune the CTCF-cohesin protein complex, as well as
two neuron scientists to develop a more complete understanding of gene regulation while considering 3D
genome and other genetic and epigenetic features. Given the PI's track record and productivity, having three
computational goals and two collaborative goals is not only feasible but computationally and biologically
rewarding. In five years, once the proposed studies are accomplished, the PI should have established a
uniquely independent place in the field of 3D genome, maintaining leading positions in inferring single-cell 3D
genome structures, enhancing Hi-C data resolution, and building 3D genome databases, while establishing
similar positions in reconstructing high-resolution 3D genome structures, finding lncRNAs' roles in the
formation of genome structures, and understanding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation."
10911303,"Despite tremendous technical advances in drug discovery, de novo development of small molecule drugs is still
challenging. High-throughput screening (HTS) with libraries of natural products and other complex molecules
remains the bedrock approach. However, HTS is unsatisfactory in many ways: extraordinary cost, poor
efficiency, rampant false positives and a complexity of “hits” that hinders hit-to-lead development. Fragment
based drug discovery (FBDD) was brilliantly conceived to overcome these limitations, but has arguably not
performed as hoped. The limited impact of FBDD is because most fragment “hit” molecules are very weak binders
and are undetectable by current assay methods. The enormous potential of FBDD is therefore lost. Here, an
approach is to be developed that can reliably detect weak but specific binding with the goal of helping to
reinvigorate and enhance early phase small molecule drug discovery.
Faithful detection of binding requires that the ligand and protein concentrations be at least on the order of the
dissociation constant, which is practically and financially unrealistic for weak binders. The strategy to remove
this basic barrier is simple. The water core of the reverse micelle (RM) is used to confine a single protein molecule
and fragments at high enough concentrations to overcome the unfavorable binding entropy. NMR spectroscopy
then permits site-resolved detection and quantification of binding affinity at reasonable cost.
The first application of RM NMR FBDD highlights its potential to greatly expand small drug discovery. A rule-
of-three (Ro3) fragment screen of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) shows that 1) weak yet specific binding can be efficiently
detected in a structural context; 2) achieving the required high protein and ligand concentrations is economically
feasible; 3) a high hit rate is observed; 4) surface coverage is extraordinary and gives unprecedented connectivity
potential; 5) highly desired more polar binders are illuminated.
The door is now open to more fully realize the tremendous promise of FBDD but critical questions remain: Is the
IL-1β surface coverage typical? What is the distribution of fragment hit affinities of Ro3 and rule-of-five (Ro5)
libraries more generally? What are the chemical characteristics of useful fragments to choose for an optimal RM
NMR screening library? How useful are the very weakly binding hits for lead development? Does the Ro5 library
offer a better compromise of hit affinity and surface coverage? What is the most efficient way to carry out RM
NMR screening? Is RM NMR screening quantitatively reliable? This project will address these and other
technical challenges that stand in the way of creating a strategy that more fully enables the brilliant insights of
the FBDD paradigm and unleashes its originally anticipated potential."
10911304,"SUMMARY
Fungal pathogens infect humans, animals, and plants and cause severe consequences on
global human health and crop production. Communication between hosts and pathogens is
essential for host defense and pathogen virulence, but the underlying mechanisms are not
well understood. Previous studies in my lab discovered that some non-coding regulatory
small RNAs (sRNAs) from fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, which causes grey
mold disease on more than 1000 plant species, can be transported into host plant cells and
suppress host immunity genes, a mechanism called “Cross-Kingdom RNAi”. Recently, we
discovered that such sRNA communication is bi-directional. Plant hosts have also
developed the ability to deliver sRNAs, mainly using extracellular vesicles, to fungal cells
and induce cross-kingdom RNAi of fungal virulence-related genes. Such sRNA
communication was also observed between mammals and parasites. Although more and
more studies across diverse systems demonstrate that mobile sRNAs are key regulatory
molecules in host and pathogen interactions, the field of cross-kingdom/cross-species RNA
communication is still in its infancy. This proposal is designed to use plant Arabidopsis
and fungal pathogen Botrytis as a model system to address the outstanding questions in this
field, including, how host cells control sRNA transport upon infection, how specific classes
of small RNAs are sorted into extracellular vesicles, how fungal cells deliver sRNAs into
host cells, what are the mechanisms of RNA and vesicle uptake in the host cells and fungal
cells, and whether other classes of RNAs, such as mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs,
move between host and fungal cells, how they function in the counter party, etc.. A
combination of genetics, genomics, biochemical and molecular biology approaches will be
used. This project is expected to provide unprecedented insight into the underlying
mechanisms of cross-kingdom/cross-species RNA communications, which will ultimately
help develop innovative and eco-friendly disease control strategies and RNA-based
fungicides or antifungal drugs."

The critical challenge in the clinical management of newly-diagnosed localized prostate cancer remains
distinguishing indolent from aggressive and life-threatening cancers. Biomarkers are urgently needed to
identify those patients who harbor aggressive disease and will derive benefit from definitive treatment. We
therefore, propose to apply complimentary proteogenomic-based discovery approaches to identify and then
validate molecular features in prostate proximal fluids and tumor tissues that will be utilized in accurate early
detection of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and improve disease risk stratification. The intended use of
these biomarkers will be the early identification of men at risk for grade progression and improved risk-
stratification for them.
We have three biomarker development laboratory aims: 1) Validate our existing urine-based biomarkers for
grade progression in a ProBE-compliant study selected from our own cohorts and the EDRN GU upgrading
study. 2) Develop and validate urine and tissue-based biomarkers for the risk-stratification of MRI “invisible”
high-grade lesions. 3) Develop and validate biomarkers to sub-stratify risk associated with deleterious
germline BRCA2 variants.
Our biomarker reference laboratory will develop and validate targeted clinically robust assays for multi-protein
biomarkers panels. We will also develop decision algorithms that are cross-referenced for statistical rigor and
benchmarked for optimal clinical performance. In addition to these BCC activities, we will develop robust
PRM-MS assays and statistically rigorous decision tools for other EDRN BCCs and CVCs.
Taken together, our EDRN biomarker characterization center will be a core part of the the EDRN ecosystem.
We will continue to actively participate in trans-Network activities, and to share patient cohorts, protocols,
datasets and analysis approaches and expertise. We will supplement these activities by focusing on
promoting the growth of new and diverse talent in biomarker development through fostering junior investigator
involvement across the full spectrum of biomarker development."
10910974,"Eicosanoids are biologically active products of phospholipid metabolism which are involved in the
pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in humans. Published data has implicated
that eicosanoids derived from the microsomal Prostaglandin Synthase type 1 (mPGES-1) and 15-Lipoxygenase
(12/15-LOX) enzymes are involved in mediating tissue injury in multiple different cell types including epithelial
cells and bone marrow derived monocytes (BMDMs). Of note, mPGES-1 and 12/15-LOX are thought to be
critical mediators of kidney damage in many different animal models of acute and chronic renal diseases.
 In order to develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat kidney disease, in particular chronic kidney
disease (CKD), a better understanding of how eicosanoids are produced among specific cell types in the disease
renal microenvironment is urgently needed. Our overall hypothesis is that mPGES-1 and 12/15-LOX-derived
products from both resident cells and recruited inflammatory cells are instrumental in pathways that control
renal epithelial injury, inflammation, and fibrosis during UUO; and that manipulating the balance of these
eicosanoids by genetic or pharmacologic means is a viable therapy to modify renal disease progressions
 This proposal seeks to test this hypothesis using a bone marrow transplantation approach to generate
mice chimeric for mPGES-1 and 12/15-LOX expression. These mice will undergo unilateral ureteral
obstruction (UUO), a model of renal fibrosis; and chronic folic acid nephropathy, a model of fibrosis and CKD
progression. Renal tissue injury and renal failure will be quantified using standardized as well as cutting edge
techniques. We will employ state of the art microscopy, flow cytometry, transcriptional profiling, and lipidomic
analysis in our studies. We will compare how targeted deletion of mPGES-1 and 12/15-LOX from infiltrating
bone marrow-derived cells and from resident cell types influence renal injury and CKD progression.
 Additionally, we will study the effects of these two pathways in a novel cell culture in-vitro model using
monocytes and renal epithelial cells isolated directly from genetically altered mice. We will examine how cell-
specific expression of these enzymes and products in monocytes and epithelial cells influences downstream
molecular pathways which will be further altered using experimental chemical agents. These studies will
provide solid mechanistic evidence for novel therapeutic approaches to treat humans with kidney disease."
10911855,"Program Summary
“Science Journeys” will incorporate lessons learned from our previously funded SEPA based in DC Public
Libraries and out-of-school time (OST) programs in the DC Metro Area and New York State. This proposal
engages a novel and unique audience of learners: children and families who are navigating hospitalization and
complex care, an often stressful, high-intensity experience accompanied by loss of in-school instruction. We
will provide a hands-on inquiry-based STEM learning program modeled after our established art and science
curriculum to improve the physical, cognitive, and social development of children and their families. “Journeys”
participants will use their own health data to further their understanding of the body, what diseases affect kids,
and how diagnostic methods/tests, treatments, and healthcare teams help them get well.
Specifically, in collaboration with Child Life Specialists and Parent Advocates, our previously successful OST
curriculum will be expanded for children in grades K to eight who are receiving inpatient and outpatient care.
The program will use experiential learning and hands-on, age appropriate STEM activities that spark curiosity,
build STEM identity and literacy, improve physical and mental health, and support wellness for patients and
their families through the integration of Social and Emotional Learning concepts. “Journeys” will incorporate
robotics, system models, patterns, mechanisms, and computing concepts aligned to Next Generation Science
Standards. With a particular focus on engineering and math, participants will engage in critical exploration of
their own health data using interactive notebooks. Further, “Journeys” will introduce participants to varied
healthcare professions and clinical research/trials. In collaboration with the hospital’s broadcast media center,
participants will be exposed to multimedia experiences in patient rooms, classrooms, and play/common
spaces.
Over the course of five years, we will partner with regional and national Child Life Departments to pilot and
implement the program in several hospitals. Collaborating with other national organizations/associations, we
will disseminate the program through workshops and annual meetings/conferences. We will provide
professional development training for Child Life Specialists, advanced practice nurses, educators, parents,
trainees, and hospital volunteers.
This hands-on program will engage children and families in meaningful learning opportunities during otherwise
unfilled gaps in schooling to preserve continuity of education; further, “Journeys” will build skills and provide
tools to improve their understanding of their personal health conditions, to improve engagement with their
healthcare team and increase agency in their health journey."

remodeling by stable isotope labeling with sensitivity comparable to radio-isotope tracing with the specificity
and broad coverage of modern mass spectrometry based lipidomics. This is enabled by an ultra-high
resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer I developed in collaboration of Thermo Scientific, now commercially
available as the Lumos 1M. This instrument has sufficient resolution to resolve the natural abundance 13C
from a tracer isotope, for example 2H, in intact lipid ions. By resolving the dominant natural abundance ions
from tracer isotopes will improve the signal to noise ratio by at least 2 orders of magnitude (1:1 vs >1:100) and
increase the dynamic range. This advancement will allow in vivo analysis of lipid metabolism to study a
variety of disease, and will ultimately lead to lipid fluxomics analysis that is translatable to human studies. By
measuring lipid flux in patients we will be able to directly studying the progression of metabolic syndrome,
potentially circumventing the need for animal models, and measure the effectiveness of therapies and
interventions.
 To facilitate the development and widespread implementation of this technology, I will address the
fundamental roadblocks to adapting this technology. Firstly, the commercial instrument is engineered for
proteomics applications, in particular the electrospray ionization source. By working with the manufacturer and
translating my lipidomics experience to this new platform I will overcome these issue. Secondly, I will develop
novel data collection approaches for both chromatography and direct infusion based applications to
accommodate the long transient time and coalescence issues associated with ultra-high resolution resonance
based mass spectrometry. Thirdly, software tools will be developed to extract ultra-high resolution data in a
time efficient manner, convert the data to physically interpretable parameters, and map data onto biochemical
pathways. Lastly, I will develop protocols and platforms for stable isotope labeling by deuterium labeled water
(D2O) and other isotope labeled metabolic tracers in mouse models of metabolic syndrome relevant to my lab’s
research program studying the mechanism for fat accumulation. By accomplishing these aims this technology
will be accessible to the biomedical research community. My multi-disciplinary training in engineering,
physical, analytical and biochemistry, and mouse genetics makes me well-suited to develop this technology
and the lipid centric research environment at UT Southwestern is the ideal location for the initial application."

Heart transplantation is currently the only treatment for advanced stage heart failure and as such, the volume of
transplants performed globally continues to increase. Advances in surgical technique and available
immunosuppression have improved patient survival acutely, however the same cannot be said years after
transplantation. Immune mediated pathologies such as chronic allograft vasculopathy result in graft failure and
significant morbidity from prolonged use of immunosuppressant medication including renal dysfunction, diabetes,
and malignancy, continue to be experienced by patients. Therefore, improved strategies to promote survival of
the cardiac allograft are necessary.
A great deal of research has sought to identify the cellular actors responsible for cardiac allograft rejection and
tolerance. In the setting of rejection, the adaptive immune response has emerged in a leading role, specifically
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Importantly, T cells are not solo performers but instead require instruction provided by
antigen presenting cells, predominantly dendritic cells (DCs). Once considered a homogenous population, DCs
are now recognized for their distinct ontogeny and functional roles which determine DC subset identity.
Conventional DC 1 cells (cDC1s) are powerful mediators of the immune response and have been shown to be
critical for the promotion of central tolerance. Yet no work on the subset specific role of cDC1s in solid organ
transplantation has been performed and our understanding of cDC1s in peripheral tolerance remains in its
infancy. Importantly, my preliminary data implicate cDC1s as necessary in donor-induced tolerization strategies
that result in long term cardiac allograft survival.
Tolerization strategies utilizing infused donor antigen and costimulation blockade (CoB) produce long term
cardiac allograft survival in murine and nonhuman primate models, though little is known as to how exposure of
donor alloantigen influences tolerance induction. This proposal hypothesizes that during a donor-induced
tolerance strategy, the cDC1 subset is necessary to promote peripheral immunological
hyporesponsiveness towards cardiac allografts through processing of alloantigen, modulation of
surface marker expression, and metabolic transcriptional reprogramming. This hypothesis will be tested
using mouse models of cDC1 deletion and heterotopic heart transplantation alongside functional (palpation,
echocardiography) and cellular (flow cytometry, histology) analysis. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics of
splenic DCs after in vivo allo- and iso- infusion in the presence of CoB coupled with in vitro experimentation will
help unveil cDC1 specific programming that promote a tolerogenic allospecific response. Thus, the proposed
studies will identify targetable pathways to enhance immunologic tolerance and improve cardiac allograft survival."

Enzymes are powerful biocatalysts that may be repurposed for efficient and sustainable synthesis
of industrial and pharmaceutical compounds. Identifying novel enzyme-catalyzed reactions and
understanding their catalytic mechanisms is essential for expanding the biocatalytic toolbox. We
have recently discovered a unique copper-containing antibiotic, fluopsin C, which is produced by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections. By
studying how P. aeruginosa makes fluopsin C, we identified an unusual biosynthetic pathway that
involves novel enzyme chemistry. For instance, two iron-dependent enzymes of a new heme-
oxygenase-like enzyme family catalyze a carbon excision and an oxidative decarboxylation and
N-hydroxylation respectively. Two lyases of the adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme family exhibit
novel activities of making and breaking carbon-sulfur bonds respectively. The chemistries we
identified have expanded the catalytic capabilities of these enzyme families. We hypothesize that
the fluopsin C biosynthetic enzymes use novel catalytic mechanisms and can be repurposed or

enzyme kinetics, structural biology, spectroscopy, and synthetic chemistry tools, with a focus on
three enzymes in fluopsin C biosynthesis. Studies of these distinct enzymes will advance the
fundamental understanding of how their respective enzyme family catalyzes diverse chemistry.
Defining the mechanisms and substrate scope of the enzymes will allow them to be further

 DNA replication is essential to maintain the genome of all organisms. During each round of cell division,
eukaryotic cells must establish hundreds to thousands of replication forks that coordinately replicate each
chromosome. These events begin during G1, when two copies of the replicative helicase, the Mcm2-7
complex, are loaded at all potential origins of DNA replication. Once loaded, the two ring-shaped,
heterohexameric Mcm2-7 complexes encircle the DNA and interact tightly via their N-terminal domains.
Although inactive, the resulting head-to-head Mcm2-7 double hexamer licenses each origin for subsequent
bidirectional initiation upon entry into S phase. Consistent with their importance, mutations in or misregulation
of the proteins mediating helicase loading lead to cancer and developmental abnormalities. Thus,
understanding the mechanism of these processes will provide critical information concerning the maintenance
of genome integrity and potential targets for therapeutics.
 The biochemical reconstitution of helicase loading using budding yeast proteins has been a powerful
tool to understand these events, however, bulk biochemical assays are poorly suited to study the complex
dynamics involved in helicase loading due to their frequently incomplete and asynchronous nature. Single-
molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments bypass these problems by monitoring events on individual
DNA molecules in real time, defining the sequence of biochemical events, detecting short-lived intermediates
and specific protein-protein interactions, and defining quantitative kinetic mechanisms. We propose single-
molecule experiments on helicase loading using reconstituted yeast proteins in vitro, supplemented with
molecular genetics experiments on live cells. Together, these studies will provide critical insights into the
dynamic mechanisms of helicase loading and will complement and aid in the interpretation of the static
structures revealed in recent cryoelectron microscopy studies.
 The proposed research primarily focuses on events of helicase loading that are conserved across all
eukaryotic organisms. Both yeast and metazoan ORC induce a strong bend in the DNA upon binding. In
Specific Aim one, we investigate the role of this activity in origin selection and determine which steps in
helicase loading require this function. The MO complex is a key helicase-loading intermediate that ensures the
second recruited Mcm2-7 forms head-to-head interactions with the first. In Aim two, we will determine the role
of this complex in closing of the Mcm2-7 ring around DNA and define the pathways by which ORC and Mcm2-
7 form this complex. In the final Aim, we will determine how nucleosomes and sequence-nonspecific ORC
DNA binding change helicase loading, both key elements of origin selection in metazoan species."

 This application for the Paul B. Beeson Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging (K76) is for
Dr. Corey Simon, a physical therapist and geriatric pain researcher specializing in low back pain. Low back
pain is one of the world’s most disabling conditions for older adults, with more than 75% reporting persistent
disability 1-2 years after onset. A novel disability mechanism among older adults with low back pain is high
stress reactivity, which is an acute physiologic response characterized by abnormal changes in blood
biomarkers after stressful encounters. High stress reactivity is linked to poorer health outcomes including
disability in other chronic conditions; and accumulating research suggests high stress reactivity is mediated by
abnormal thoughts and feelings and is modifiable through biobehavioral interventions. However, stress
reactivity research in older adults with low back pain is lacking. This proposal in an innovative 5-year research
program that builds upon Dr. Simon’s pilot study demonstrating exciting preliminary associations between
stress reactivity, physical function, and psychological distress. This proposal will utilize novel laboratory stress
reactivity tests, patient-reported outcomes, and qualitative interviews to: 1) Identify and quantify stress
reactivity in older adults with low back pain; and 2) For the purpose of reducing disability risks, develop a
biobehavioral intervention that targets high stress reactivity in older adults with low back pain. This program will
test his central hypothesis that older adults with low back pain and high stress reactivity are at greater risk for
disability due to negative thoughts and feelings and poor coping strategies. In addition, this program will
provide Dr. Simon with advanced career development in stress reactivity science, behavioral intervention
development, and research leadership. Upon completion of this program, Dr. Simon will be poised to facilitate
the development of an NIA-funded clinical trial (R34/R01) to test the efficacy of his innovative biobehavioral
rehabilitation intervention for older adults with low back pain that targets high stress reactivity. Collectively, this
program is the next step in Dr. Simon’s long-term goal to become an international leader in the development of
targeted interventions to eradicate disability in older adults with low back pain."

With stagnant cure rates, there is a severe unmet need for strategies to improve oral and all other types
of aerodigestive cancer survival. There are no robust chemoprevention drugs or other treatments for high
risk oral precancerous conditions or field carcinogenesis despite 40 years of clinical trial research. High
risk oral precancerous conditions (such as leukoplakia) represent a standard target for chemoprevention
interventions. Type II anti-diabetic agents, including pioglitazone and metformin, are promising cancer
prevention drugs for oral cavity preneoplasia that we have used in NCI sponsored clinical trials. They
have adequate safety and moderate efficacy in human trials, however, individually are likely not sufficient
to advance to large scale clinical trials. These agents have differing mechanisms of action which each
attack different events in oral carcinogenesis. In this project, we propose to conduct a phase IIa 12 week
clinical trial with combination BID pioglitazone-metformin (15mg-500mg) in oral preneoplasia patients.
We have assembled a consortium of clinics in Minneapolis/St. Paul MN for efficient accrual to this trial.
We will examine pharmacodynamic endpoints in specimens based on both the mechanisms of the
agents and how they may affect T cell subsets before and after treatment. Further, we will also analyze
leukoplakia specimens and adjacent normal mucosa specimens by RNA-Seq before and after treatment,
which will shed light on effects of the drugs as well as any putative “off target” effects. At the completion
of this project, we will have a better understanding of pioglitazone and metformin effects on oral
carcinogenesis, as well as, an early stage clinical trial which could be expanded to larger randomized
trials with a promising cancer prevention strategy for oral preneoplasia or other tobacco-associated
malignancies."
10911648,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term product goal of this project is a small molecule cancer therapeutic targeting the MYC oncoprotein,
which is a transcriptional factor that regulates key transcriptional programs required for cellular growth and
proliferation. Due to its aberrant expression in more than 70% of human cancers and the functional validation
that MYC inhibition arrests cancer growth, MYC has been the most sought-after therapeutic target in cancer.
Despite decades of effort, therapeutic targeting of MYC has been unattainable due to a combination of factors,
including a lack of enzymatic activity or obvious ligand binding sites that can aid in inhibitor identification. Recent
research by the PI, Dr. Feris, in the Cole laboratory at Dartmouth, has uncovered an Achilles’ heel in MYC that
has enabled therapeutic targeting of this previously undruggable target. While unraveling the molecular
mechanism underlying MYC’s interaction with the TRansactivation/tRansformation-domain Associated Protein
(TRRAP), which is essential for many of the MYC-driven aberrant transcriptional programs that promote cancer,
Dr. Feris’ research revealed a vulnerability in MYC. This insight led to the development of a revolutionary
screening platform which was later deployed to screen more than 0.5 million compounds. Partial assessment of
the high-throughput screening (HTS) efforts identified several hits that not only blocked intracellular MYC:TRRAP
protein-protein interaction (PPI) at low µM potency but also potently (2 µM) attenuated 2D and 3D growth of
multiple cancer cell lines in a highly MYC-dependent manner, highlighting the specificity and selectivity of the
hits. The goal of the current Fast-Track application is hit-to-lead development of these and any additional new
hits for future clinical development as novel MYC-targeted therapeutics for cancer. The focus of the one-year
Phase I STTR portion of the Fast-Track project is to conclude hit discovery efforts by completing HTS hit
assessment while simultaneously testing the hypothesis, using our recently-identified heterocyclic amide
compound (A1), that MYC:TRRAP PPI inhibition attenuates tumor growth in a human lymphoma xenograft
model. The focus of the two-year Phase II SBIR portion of the Fast-Track project is hit-to-lead generation of
advanced leads using an iterative process combining medicinal chemistry, in vitro MYC-specific bioassays, in
vitro ADME/ tox, PK and efficacy in the mouse human lymphoma model. Identification of at least one safe and
efficacious advanced lead compound that reduces tumor burden by >50% would constitute study success. Given
the ubiquity of MYC-driven cancers, a MYC-targeted therapy, which is currently lacking, would be of immense
therapeutic value to cancer patients. This Fast-Track application will enable completion of foundational studies,
which are currently undertaken by cosMYC, Inc, a biotech company co-founded by Dr. Feris to drive the product
towards commercialization. Moreover, this ‘Small Business Transition Grant for Early Career Scientists’ will
enable the successful transitioning of Dr. Feris from an academic scientist to an industry executive to oversee
business development activities that are critical to ensure that this transformative therapy reaches patients."

The indications and demand for genetic testing in cancer care are rapidly growing. Hereditary cancer
syndromes are more common than previously appreciated, and genetic testing is standard of care to
establish these diagnoses. Genetic test results are also critical to guiding targeted therapies in patients
with established tumors such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Genetic counselors have traditionally
managed the testing process, but there is a critical shortage of counselors and they are not able to meet
the demand for testing. Without a genetic counselor, effective communication of testing options, outcomes,
and risks could be compromised. One of the most challenging decisions is the choice of gene panel. Multi-
gene panels are now the norm, but panels can include as few as 5 or as many as 125 genes. Panels can
include genes associated with a single tumor type or multiple tumor types, and genes with weaker evidence
for pathogenicity may also be included. There is no consensus on what constitutes an ideal panel, and
the choice of panel is therefore highly individualized. Innovative strategies to support patients facing these
time-sensitive and complex pre-test decisions are needed.
Decision aids are well-suited to address this challenge by providing education, facilitating the process of
informed choice, clarifying personal preferences, and promoting shared decision making. We propose to
develop an electronic decision aid to assist individuals in choosing a multi-gene panel with their medical
oncologist instead of a genetic counselor. We will test the hypothesis that a decision aid without a genetic
counselor can facilitate quality decisions around the selection of a specific multi-gene panel. In addition
to positive changes in knowledge, shared decision making, and decisional conflict, we anticipate that the
decision aid will increase access to genetic testing in a timely manner. Utilizing an effectiveness-
implementation hybrid study design, we propose these specific aims: (1) To develop and pilot electronic
decision aids for selection of a multi-gene panel in ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients. (2) To evaluate
the efficacy of the decision aid with an oncologist versus a traditional genetic counselor session for multi-
gene panel testing in a randomized clinical trial at multiple institutions. (3) To evaluate the effectiveness of
implementation of the decision aid in multiple, diverse populations.
These decision aids will establish a much needed and new paradigm for quality decision making and
communication around multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancer syndromes. This format will uniquely
address the current barriers that include the complex decision of which multi-gene panel to select, limited
genetic counselor resources, and lack of time and expertise on the part of practicing oncologists."

Depression is the #1 cause of disease-related disability worldwide and prevalence rates for depression and
suicide have increased significantly in the United States over the past 25 years. Young adults, including
college students, have especially high rates of depression, yet a majority of individuals with clinically significant
symptoms do not seek formal treatment. Previous work by the Candidate (Dr. Adam Horwitz) suggests that
college students at elevated risk for suicide may decline formal treatment due to barriers such as lack of time,
low perceived need for treatment, or limited access to services. Mobile health technologies offer promising new
opportunities to overcome these barriers and improve outcomes. Further, the use of mobile technologies in
combination with wearable sensors allow for the gathering of real-time subjective and objective data, and an
ability to respond to mood changes directly with an intervention at the time it is needed. This K23 Mentored
Career Development Award application proposes a program of focused research and training to facilitate the
Candidate’s transition to an independent career in patient-oriented research with a specialization in low-burden
adaptive mobile preventative interventions for mood and suicide risk. The specific research aims are to: 1)
using a participatory action approach, identify the target population preferences, barriers to engagement, and
relevant domains for ecological momentary assessments and personalized feedback messages; and 2)
conduct a pilot feasibility micro-randomized trial of a mobile health personalized feedback intervention with
college students (N = 60) at risk for depressive episodes. The Candidate will pursue these research aims by
obtaining specific training to gain expertise in: 1) participatory action research methods for intervention
development; 2) mHealth, micro-randomized trials, and adaptive mobile intervention development and
evaluation; and 3) advanced statistical analysis for mobile, sensor, and ecological momentary assessment
data. These training objectives will be met through close mentorship from experts in these content areas,
specialized trainings and didactics, and applied research experiences. Findings from the outlined
investigations will provide invaluable pilot data regarding acceptability, feasibility, perceived helpfulness, and
hypothesized mechanisms of change, as well as potential features and thresholds that can be used as
intervention triggers in an adaptive design. Together, these findings will directly inform an NIH R01 application
at the conclusion of the study period seeking to evaluate a just-in-time adaptive intervention designed to
optimize the delivery of personalized feedback messages, and provide additional coping tips, tools, and/or
resources when indicated. In summary, the training and research opportunities outlined in this proposal will
provide the necessary skills for a promising Candidate to launch a career in developing accessible and
impactful adaptive mobile interventions to reduce depression and suicide among young people."

Understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity and architecture are key to stratify cancer
patients responsive to immunotherapy and clinical outcome. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a
powerful tool for studying the TME at the single-cell level, however, spatial information between single cells
was not preserved in this technology, which is vital in studying the TME. In contrast, use of spatially resolved
transcriptomics holds the promise in the understanding of the spatial contexture of the TME because of its
power to capture the location of individual cells within the larger tissue architecture. Recently,
commercialization of spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies have allowed researchers to study at an
unprecedented level the spatial architecture of the TME. Similar to other “omics” technologies, novel
computational tools are urgently needed to decipher and infer biological meaning for these high-dimensional
ST data. In addition to the need for methods for analyzing and visualizing ST data in its current form, there is
the need to develop methods for the future state of ST, whereby the level of cellular resolution is vastly
decreasing to the single cell level. Moreover, the application of multiple assays to one tissue sample is also
producing multiple modalities measured on the same sample (e.g., scRNAseq, image-based cytometry
methods such as multiplex immunofluorescence) which requires effective methods for data integration. Lastly,
many ST studies are completed on multiple samples simultaneous with the goal of correlating TME features
with clinical outcome, thus requiring computational tools to unravel the impact of the spatial architecture of the
TME on clinical response. In the proposed research, we will tackle these challenges by implementing state-of-
the-art statistical and computational methods that account for and leverage the spatial information present in
ST data to understanding the TME. We will develop innovative methods for assessing the TME’s composition
(Aim 1) and studying co-localization and spatial heterogeneity (Aim 2), along with hardening of the analytical
software, spatialGE, for the analysis and visualization of ST data (Aim 3). The statistical and bioinformatics
analytical approaches implemented in spatialGE will allow cancer researchers to easily leverage these
methods in their studies of the TME. These analytical methods, along with the developed software tools
(spatialGE R/Bioconductor package along with web-based software), will be established in collaboration with
clinical, translational, and basic science cancer investigators to ensure usability and interpretability of the
developed approaches."

Hypertension disproportionally affects populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially in
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), with a high prevalence and low control rate, resulting in an excess
burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite widely available evidence-based interventions, only 7.7% of
patients in LMICs had their blood pressure (BP) controlled in 2010. To close the knowledge-practice gap for
hypertension control in LAC, a multidisciplinary team of investigators from Colombia, Jamaica, and the US will
work with national and local government agencies and health systems to test the implementation and
effectiveness outcomes of implementing and scaling up a team-based care strategy for BP control in Colombia
and Jamaica. The RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance) framework is being
used to guide the development and evaluation of the implementation strategies. Physician-nurse (or
pharmacist)-community health worker (CHW) teams will work collaboratively with patients to achieve shared
treatment goals. Nurses or pharmacists will titrate medications using a simple protocol under physician
supervision, CHWs will conduct health coaching on lifestyle change and medication adherence, and patients
will actively engage in self-management (including home BP monitoring). Specific Aim 1 will test the reach,
effectiveness, adoption, implementation (fidelity), and maintenance (sustainability) of implementing a team-
based care strategy in a cluster randomized trial. A total of 40 primary care clinics (20 from Colombia and 20
from Jamaica; 32 patients per clinic and 1,280 in total) will be randomly assigned to a team-based care
strategy or enhanced usual care for 12 months to test implementation and effectiveness outcomes. A 6-month
post-trial follow-up study will be conducted to assess sustainability. This trial has 90% statistical power to
detect an absolute difference of 15% in hypertension control (BP<140/90 mm Hg) using a 2-sided significance
level of 0.05. Specific Aim 2 will assess barriers and implementation outcomes of scaling up a team-based
care strategy in an observational study. Training will be provided to scale up team-based care in all remaining
141 primary care clinics (78 from Colombia and 63 from Jamaica) after the cluster trial. However, scale-up
activities will not be supported by external funding. Barriers and implementation outcomes will be collected
using interview, survey, and administrative data at primary care clinic and provider team levels. In addition, we
will be able to compare implementation outcomes among 3 groups — intervention with external funding (clinics
in the trial intervention group), intervention without external funding (clinics in the observational study), and
usual care (clinics in the trial control group). We will conduct mediation analyses to understand the
mechanisms of team-based care on BP control and a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate implementation
costs. The proposed study will identify effective, equitable, and sustainable strategies to achieve hypertension
control in routine clinical settings and reduce CVD risk in the general population of LAC and other LMICs."

The improvement in breast cancer survival is partially due to improvements in treatments. However, these
treatments are not without mild to life-threatening side effects. For example, anthracycline chemotherapies (e.g.
doxorubicin) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) targeted therapies have been shown to
cause cardiotoxicity (CTX), or damage to the heart. This side effect is of great concern as survivors are more
likely to die of heart disease than any other diagnosis and racial disparities exist with regard to prevalence of
CTX and risk of heart-related mortality. Factors that have been shown to contribute to cardiotoxicity include Black
race and the presence of comorbidities. While the cardiovascular disease literature includes the roles of
psychosocial and sociocultural factors in its prevalence and the racial disparity in its manifestation and
progression, these factors are unexplored in the context CTX. Additionally, cancer care delivery factors, including
maintenance of CTX, deserves attention as there may be opportunities to address gaps or differences in care
that may exacerbate the CTX disparity. Addressing psychosocial and sociocultural factors may provide
intervention targets to mitigate CTX disparities. Guided by the Social Ecological Model, I will conduct
retrospective analyses and a historical-prospective cohort study to identify factors related to the racial disparity
in CTX. During the K99 mentored phase, I will abstract electronic hospital data on breast cancer survivors treated
with anthracycline chemotherapy or Her-2 targeted therapies to elucidate sociodemographic, clinical, and
maintenance factors that relate to onset of and racial differences in CTX (Aim 1). In Aim 2, I will conduct in-depth
interviews with Black and White survivors (n=20) with and without CTX to understand psychosocial and
sociocultural experiences that may contribute to CTX. During the R00 phase (Aim 3), I will use the information
learned from the in-depth interviews to inform a survey that will be distributed to n=150 Black and White breast
cancer survivors who were treated with adjuvant therapies. This survey, coupled with medical record data, will
be used to assess relationships between psychosocial and socio-cultural factors and racial differences in CTX.
In order to successfully execute these aims the candidate will receive strategic planning in cancer care delivery,
cardio-oncology, and mixed methods research. These training aims will ensure the candidate's goal of
successfully transitioning to independence and establishing a research program involving the development of
interventions that will address racial disparities in cancer care delivery and outcomes. The expertise and
guidance of the mentoring and advisory teams in addition to the wealth of resources and commitment to training
provided through the institutional environment will ensure the success of the candidate's research project and
transition to independence."

The role of brain endothelial cells (ECs) and in particular the role of cilium, a microtubule flow sensor organelle
expressed on the apical surface of ECs and facing the lumen has been poorly studied in the context of blood-
brain-barrier (BBB) function. ECs and in turn cilia are the first line of contact with red blood cells (RBCs) in the
blood. Studies from us and others suggest that cilia on ECs are critical for flow-mediated brain vessel stability.
Thus, how flow relays signals to ECs via cilia and in turn to cells of the neurovascular (NVU) unit is not known.
Without this knowledge, our ability to generate BBB models that mimic in vivo conditions will be hampered. The
question of EC-cilia and its role in BBB function is clinically relevant given that patients with sickle cell disease
(SCD) are predisposed to both overt and silent cerebral infarct, caused by sickle RBCs adhesion to the
endothelium. The adhesion of sickle RBCs to endothelium may facilitate the physical removal of cilia
(deciliation) from ECs surface, a mechanism recently identified in mammalian cilia shedding. In this multi-PI
proposal, investigative team in vascular biology, sickle cell biology, human induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC)-derived BBB and NVU models, cilia biology and rodent injury models will investigate the overarching
hypothesis that disturbed cerebral blood flow triggers deciliation and release of cilia into the blood, thus
resulting in aberrant signaling in the deciliated ECs and in the surrounding cells that comprise the NVU
resulting in impact on NVU and BBB (Fig. 1). The objective of this proposal is to study RBCs-EC-cilia
interaction and its importance to BBB model development. In the R61 phase, we will test whether RBCs from
sickle cell disease (mouse models & human patients) will directly or indirectly trigger cilia shedding in brain
ECs in vitro and in vivo. We will identify proteins in the cilia shed fragments, and also assess the importance of
EC-cilia on BBB phenotypes in vitro and in vivo with emphasis on BBB integrity. Upon successfully establishing
the milestone that RBC-EC-cilia interaction is critical for BBB function in the R61 phase, a go-decision in the
R33 phase will initiate deeper probe into the underlying mechanisms and the role of the RBC-EC cilia
interaction in SCD and traumatic brain injury (TBI) rodent models in vivo. The significance of this project is
that EC-cilia status is an important determinant when brain ECs are included in flow-mediated BBB model
development in vitro. The innovation is that until now, EC-cilia has been largely ignored in BBB protocols and
accomplishing the objectives of this proposal will move the status quo in this field. This proposal will also bring
us one step closer to monitoring cerebral vessel impairment using RBC-triggered EC-cilia shedding as a
biomarker of vascular health, a NIH mission-related topic of research."

This collaborative project, Mindfulness and Integrative Health Data Network (MINDNET), responds to RFA-AT-
25-005 by creating a highly usable and accessible data repository of complementary and integrative health (CIH)
interventions, producing high-quality reviews and methodology papers, and creating pilot awards and providing
education, training, and communications to enhance impact. There has been exponential growth of clinical trials
of CIH interventions and a strong need to stay abreast of new findings by efficiently synthesizing information
across PICOs (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome), evaluating new models and formats of CIH
programs (e.g., via mobile delivery), and fostering timely reviews and meta-analyses for key stakeholders
including health insurers, policy makers, patients and providers. Greater support and resources are also needed
for the scientific community to utilize CIH data with rigorous methodology, state of art practices, and to
disseminate review findings for key stakeholders. The MINDNET project will build on our team’s expertise in
systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and other CIH interventions,
experience creating and maintaining a public repository for meta-analyses, and implementation science work
with key stakeholders to identify the highest priority evidence needs and disseminating findings for evidence-
informed policy and practice. Specifically, Aim 1 will involve creating a data repository of CIH interventions
through systematic literature search and coding. Strategic planning meetings with advisory committee and
NCCIH priority will inform the CIH intervention domains (e.g., mindfulness, yoga, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture,
chiropractic) and outcome areas (e.g., pain, psychiatric symptoms). An open-access data repository will be
produced as a result, with regular updates every 6 months. The platform will be built on prior success of Metapsy,
a public data repository for reviews and meta-analyses of psychotherapy, and will incorporate advanced features
for data interface. Aim 2 will capitalize on our team’s expertise to produce high-quality meta-analyses of MBIs,
as well as methodology papers aiming to advance the science of CIH reviews and clinical trial methodology. Aim
3 will generate non-MBI focused pilot awards to produce systematic reviews and meta-analyses in key areas of
CIH, with resources, coding support, and quality assurance provided by the core MINDNET team. Aim 3 will also
include education and training via asynchronous and synchronous forms to foster rigorously conducted reviews,
and communications to increase the impact of MINDNET and its research. The long-term vision of MINDNET is
to (a) foster open science, transparency, and rigor in CIH reviews and clinical trials; (b) advance CIH science by
providing clear synthesis of evidence, addressing key gaps in the current literature and identifying priorities for
future research; and (c) foster collaboration and training of CIH scientists. In conclusion, this R24 grant
application will provide a living, sophisticated, and advanced data repository of CIH interventions and foster
efficient, high quality evidence syntheses used by key stakeholders for societal impact."
10917640,"Bilateral Acoustic Sensing and Automated Breathing Segmentation for Remote
 Monitoring of Patients with COPD: A Longitudinal Study
Abstract: This SBIR Fast-Track project complies with NIH NOSI number NOT-OD-21-100, focusing on a
novel mobile health system for remote monitoring of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using a
wearable multimodal sensor. COPD is the third leading cause of death globally, with over 3 million fatalities and
an annual cost of $52 billion in the U.S. In partnership with the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network
(JHCRN), this project aims to provide innovative technology to underserved patients in the Mid-Atlantic region.
Aligning with the NIH's emphasis on improving patient adherence, the project centers on enhancing adherence to
remote monitoring and early symptom recognition to reduce COPD readmissions and healthcare costs.
 COPD symptoms include dyspnea, coughing, and sputum production. The current 23% readmission rate
poses a significant burden on the healthcare system. Early symptom detection can facilitate home treatment,
reducing readmissions and costs. Standard lung function assessments require medical expertise and are not suited
for continuous, remote monitoring. Early detection of deteriorating lung function enables timely intervention and
management of COPD severity.
 This project extends our Intel award-winning, patented wireless WearME system to capture physiologic
baselines and potential acute changes in COPD patients. WearME uses a body area sensor network with
multimodal sensing capabilities, such as digital stethoscope, body kinematics, and electrocardiogram. We will
explore our sensing modalities to capture bilateral biomarkers and changes in lung function, respiration period,
and user activity.
 In Phase I, we will assess lung function and user respiration in real-time during activities of daily living
(ADL), like walking and stair climbing, in an in-clinic cross-sectional study. The goal is to evaluate patients'
physical function and ability to perform ADL for the Phase II longitudinal study. In Phase II, we will validate our
WearME system through remote monitoring, usability, and adherence studies, associating changes in biomarkers
with ADL. To ensure high adherence rates, strategies such as push notifications, patient engagement programs,
and incentives will be implemented. For patients who do not own a suitable smartphone, we are prepared to
provide a loaner device for the duration of their participation in the study. The revised proposal emphasizes the
unique advantages of the WearME-Pro system over traditional hand-held spirometers. Unlike hand-held
spirometers that provide only intermittent data, our wearable device provides a more comprehensive picture of a
patient's respiratory health over time. The device also captures cough frequency, a known precursor to
exacerbations. Such continuous monitoring enables healthcare providers to track changes in the patient's
respiratory conditions and respond promptly to potential exacerbations.
 We have instituted regular meetings, specific task assignments, and clear communication protocols to ensure
efficient collaboration among the team members. The results of this SBIR Fast-Track project will support FDA
submission for 510(k) clearance and commercialization, leveraging partnerships with Johns Hopkins,
TidalHealth, and Tower Health to market our solution through a prescription model. By addressing patient
adherence, this project aims to significantly impact COPD management and promote better health outcomes for
patients.

10908435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infants born with congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) are at heightened risk long-term sequelae such as
intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss and cerebral palsy. Most prior work has examined
development in infants with cCMV using disease severity at birth to predict broadly defined long-term
outcomes (e.g. “normal” vs. “abnormal” development) largely ignoring environmental or psychosocial
influences that may shape long-term outcomes. Maternal stress and poorer coping skills, in general, are two
such influences that have been associated with poorer developmental outcomes in at-risk infants. Examining
developmental trajectories in infants with cCMV may allow for a more nuanced appreciation of the emergence
or lessening of developmental delays, along with correlating maternal experiences. A better understanding of
cCMV infant development, mothers’ stressors, experiences and perceived needs may yield proximal targets for
intervention, as in other conditions, to improve outcomes of infants with cCMV. Examining cCMV infant
developmental trajectories, their relationship with maternal stress, well-being and parenting experiences are
critical to creating disease-specific anticipatory guidance, interventions and support systems that may improve
infant outcomes. Therefore we will recruit and retain a birth cohort of 100 mother-infant dyads, and measure
infant development longitudinally across the first 12 months of infancy to address the following aims: Aim 1) To
identify distinct trajectories of development in infants with cCMV, and to determine whether trajectories are
associated with baseline characteristics of the infant, and mother; Aim 2) To determine whether developmental
trajectory membership is associated with maternal stress and well-being measured by self-report instruments;
and Aim 3) To examine mothers’ experiences of parenting an infant with cCMV through sequential, repeated
unstructured qualitative interviews from birth to 12 months of age. Study PI, Dr. Pesch, is a developmental and
behavioral pediatrician whose recent research and clinical work has centered around the diagnosis and
treatment of cCMV. With the support of an interdisciplinary tem of mentors and an advisor, Dr. Pesch will gain
experiences in the measurement of infant development using a virtual platform, the recruitment and retention
of a rare disease cohort, insider research methods to minimize bias and family resilience theory. This K23
supported research training will increase the understanding of the developmental trajectories of infants with
cCMV, and the relationships of those trajectories with maternal stress and well-being. These findings will lead
to a future maternal empowerment intervention for mothers of infants with cCMV to improve infant
developmental outcomes."
10908556,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: For many seriously ill patients, such as those with underlying life-limiting
chronic conditions, deterioration in health often results in acute respiratory failure (ARF), a common critical
illness that is associated with prolonged disability and high risk of death. Critical illness hospitalizations are
resource intensive and expensive, and associated with significant family caregiver burden. As a result, these
patients and their family caregivers are particularly vulnerable to significant financial hardship. We have
previously shown that financial hardship is a major source of stress for patients with ARF and their family
members. Importantly, it is persistent, worsens after hospital discharge, and is likely to be an important
mediator of psychological distress and poorer quality of life in this population, yet few studies have sought to
address the role of financial hardship in the context of patient- and family-centered outcomes over time.
 Financial hardship encompasses material (e.g. out-of-pocket expenses, unemployment), psychological
(e.g. feelings of distress), and behavioral aspects (e.g. coping mechanisms). Although financial hardship has
been established as an important and modifiable problem among outpatients with cancer, little work has been
done with patients with ARF and their families. In order to develop context-specific interventions that are likely
to be effective in meeting the unique needs of these patients and their family caregivers, we need to
understand who is at highest risk for developing financial hardship during and after critical illness, which of
these risk factors are modifiable, and the effect of financial hardship on patient- and family-centered outcomes.
 We will address this knowledge gap by using a multiple methods approach to advance our understanding
of financial hardship for seriously ill adults with ARF and their family caregivers. In Aim 1, we will identify
patients with ARF and family caregivers who are at highest risk for subsequent financial hardship by examining
both non-modifiable baseline characteristics that identify those at risk, and modifiable factors that may be the
focus for context-specific interventions. In Aim 2, we will make the important connection between financial
hardship and patient- and family-centered outcomes (psychological distress, health-related quality of life and
goal-concordant care) over time, something which has not been done for patients with ARF and their family but
is a necessary next step for the development of interventions that will successfully disrupt the long-term
consequences of financial hardship following critical illness. In Aim 3, using qualitative methods, we will explore
drivers of material hardship and factors that influence psychological responses and coping behaviors from the
perspective of key stakeholders. Our multi-disciplinary team has significant experience assessing patient- and
family-centered outcomes, performing electronic health records-based data collection, and conducting
qualitative research. Our findings will lay the groundwork for the development of interventions designed to
reduce the burden of financial hardship on patients with ARF, family caregivers, and the healthcare system."

The Pain Management Collaboratory Coordinating Center (PMC3) will continue to provide national
leadership for the NIH-DOD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC), building on its successes over the
original six-year period of funding. Three key aims are to: 1) develop, adapt, and adopt technical and policy
guidelines and best practices for the effective conduct of research in partnership with healthcare systems
focused on Veterans, military personnel, and their families; 2) work collaboratively with and provide technical,
design, and other support to Pragmatic Clinical Trial (PCT) teams, to develop and implement a pragmatic trial
protocol; and 3) disseminate widely Collaboratory-endorsed policies and best practices and lessons learned in
the PCTs for implementing research within healthcare settings. Continuation of the PMC3 will permit continued
support for the original eleven and two recently funded PCTs as well as PCTs to be funded via current and
future requests for proposals. The PMC3 will continue to leverage the infrastructure, experience, and expertise
thus far established by the Coordinating Center. Specifically, these aims will be accomplished through the
highly collaborative community that comprises the PMC Steering Committee and through PMC3-managed
Work Groups, a Patient Resource Group, and theme-based Discussion Groups. Essential to the continued
success of the PMC is its focus on developing and sustaining strong partnerships with military Veterans and
service members and with VA and DOD health care providers and organizational leaders. These partnerships
ensure the meaningfulness and relevance of the research for addressing significant gaps in the management
of pain and co-occurring conditions in these systems. These partnerships also help to ensure that positive PCT
results and products have a high likelihood for adoption in these systems, and potentially other health care
delivery systems. The proposed PMC3 continuation will support ongoing and future innovations and other
successes and yield significant and impactful technical policy guidelines, best practices, and lessons learned to
support the PMC and future PCTs."
10917839,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by β-amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles preceding
neuronal loss and cognitive decline. The overall goal of this proposal is to detect and quantify
treatment-related changes and abnormalities in Alzheimer patients’ brains using MR images
while patients are undergoing amyloid clearing drug treatment. We will develop and validate the
lesion detection and quantification software and deploy it as a clinically usable tool. Current
detection of ARIA lesions depends on visual detection by trained radiologists. In recent years,
multiple amyloid deposit modifying drugs have been developed and used in trials with
Alzheimer's disease patients. During these drug trials, it is not uncommon that some patients
developed imaging abnormalities in the brain and clinical symptoms. These amyloid-related
imaging abnormalities (ARIA) manifest as intracerebral hemorrhage (ARIA-H), and vasogenic
edema (ARIA-E). With the recent FDA approval of amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibody
aducanumab in Alzheimer’s disease, brain imaging has become an indispensable tool to
monitor the patients’ brains during therapy. The current recommendation on use of the amyloid
clearing drug aducanumab is to have MRIs prior to initiating therapy, during the titration of the
drug, and at any time the patient has symptoms suggestive of ARIA. It is recommended to have
dose interruption or treatment discontinuation for symptomatic ARIA and moderate-severe
ARIA. In addition, Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) patients also experience ARIA-like
lesions in their brains and MRI is the recommended imaging modality to monitor the CAA
progression. One would expect that in the near future amyloid deposit modifying drugs will be
used in autosomal dominant AD, or other amyloid related diseases such as Levy body dementia
concomitant with amyloid beta accumulation, or Down syndrome where amyloid plaques and
symptoms of dementia develops later in midlife of the patients. Therefore, a treatment
monitoring brain imaging software will have an important role in terms of patient care in a wider
set of disease entities where patients are given amyloid clearing drugs."
10917097,"Tyrosine kinase targeted (TKI) therapies have revolutionized leukemia treatment, but TKIs are not able to kill
leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which are responsible for propagating and disease recurrence, and believed to be
the source of treatment failure. Our long-term goals are to further address how LSC persistence is regulated,
and to develop new LSC-eliminating treatment strategies to improve cure rates and survival. The short-term
goals of this research are to determine whether a N6-methyladenosine (m6A)--long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
axis regulates LSC stemness and persistence during TKI selection process, and to explore the therapeutic
potential of targeting the m6A-lncRNA axis for eradicating TKI resistant LSCs and also decipher the underlying
molecular mechanisms. The m6A methylation is the most common epitranscriptomic modification on RNAs (i.e.,
lncRNAs), and crucially regulates lncRNA-initiated gene expression. lncRNA abnormalities frequently associate
with cancer disease progression and drug resistance. The preliminary evidence linking an m6A-lncRNA axis to
resistant LSCs is from our proof of principle studies demonstrating that i) a dynamic and reversible m6A
methylome determined by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) helps leukemia cells avoid TKI killing
leading to TKI resistance; ii) there are many lncRNAs (annotated) that are differentially expressed in resistant
versus sensitive cells. About 50% of these lncRNAs bear m6A motifs and have the changed m6A amounts in
resistant cells, collectively, suggesting a unique lncRNA signature that is specific to TKI resistance and is
regulated by m6A methylation; iii) upregulation of these m6A-associated lncRNAs in patients who do not respond
to TKIs is predicative of worse outcomes, and knockdown of them impairs resistant cell growth and renders
resistant cells sensitive to TKIs; iv) compared to sensitive ones, TKI-resistant cells highly express LSC markers
(CD117, CD44, CD25, CD133) whose upregulation is associated with m6A reduction. Our hypothesis is that the
FTO-m6A-lncRNA cascade may be a critical pathway to control LSC persistence to TKIs and a new druggable
target to eradicate persistent LSCs improving TKI cure rates. We will test our hypothesis through three aims: 1)
Determine how the FTO-m6A axis regulates lncRNA aberrations in TKI resistance; 2) Determine whether and
how a dynamic m6A methylome regulates LSC persistence to TKIs; 3) Determine whether and how
pharmacological targeting of the FTO-m6A-lncRNA cascade kills persistent LSCs using preclinical leukemia
models. The proposed studies are conceptually innovative, because it targets a new pathway (the FTO-m6A-
lncRNA cascade) in understanding LSC persistence to TKIs and in developing new regimens to eliminate TKI
resistant LSCs. The proposed research is significant, because the findings will a) identify new pathways (i.e.,
FTO-m6A-lncRNA cascade) that regulate LSC persistence, deepening the molecular understanding of LSCs and
lncRNA functions; b) develop new approaches (targeting the FTO-m6A-lncRNA cascade) to eliminate persistent
LSCs improving the management of patients with refractory leukemia."
10917101,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The Costello lab investigates cellular immortality and evolution in brain tumors with the goal of translating
our discoveries into new therapies. I play an essential role in our studies to understand and overcome the
genomic and epigenomic intra-tumor heterogeneity, driven by tumor evolution, that underlies therapeutic
failures. One translational goal is to identify mutations that produce immunogenic neoantigens that are
present throughout the whole tumor, to develop personalized immunotherapies in collaboration with Dr.
Okada. Working with an interdisciplinary clinical team, we developed a unique, 3-dimensional whole tumor
sampling approach in which we obtain 10 spatially mapped samples per tumor selected by the
neurosurgeon to maximally represent the whole tumor. We have begun applying the genomic,
transcriptomic and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data I produced from these spatially mapped samples
to identify immunogenic neoantigens and their cognate TCR present throughout the tumor. I am also a
significant contributor to our tumor immortality studies. To proliferate indefinitely, tumor cells must overcome
the normal limits on lifespan dictated in large part by telomere shortening, a consequence of cell divisions in
the absence of telomerase activity. Eighty percent of glioblastoma and many other cancers overcome this
lifespan barrier to achieve cellular immortality by acquiring a mutation in the promoter of Telomerase
Reverse Transcriptase (TERT). We discovered that the TERT promoter mutation activates the normally
silent TERT gene and telomerase activity through selective recruitment of GABP, a transcription factor
which does not normally regulate TERT. Using experimental targeting of GABP, we showed that TERT
expression is reduced selectively in cells with the TERT promoter mutation, and when combined with
chemotherapy, it dramatically reduces GBM growth in vivo. Currently, I am studying a newly discovered
homeostatic control on GABP subunit expression and its relationship to TERT regulation. To translate these
mechanistic studies into a new therapy, Dr. Costello co-founded a biotech startup which has discovered
small molecules with drug-like properties that reduce TERT in a mutation dependent manner. In addition to
performing bench research to address these translational goals, my responsibilities include: (1)
management and oversight of the lab’s infrastructure and tumor sample collection; (2) technology and
methods development for the group; (3) ensuring that all laboratory research is conducted safely in
accordance with regulatory requirements; and (4) training new lab members and individuals throughout the
Brain Tumor Center. This R50 application requests salary support for these ongoing activities to advance
the scientific goals of the following NCI-funded projects: 3-D spatial approach to discover genomic effectors

 Achieving the nation’s Ending the HIV (EHE) Epidemic plan goals will require a significant increase in
access to and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among cisgender Black women (CBW). CBW
continue to bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV cases through heterosexual contact, and are far less
likely to use PrEP. These factors magnify the health and social consequences of HIV to CBW. Although PrEP
is available, CBW are among the least likely groups to use it, as only 2% of PrEP-eligible CBW have reported
PrEP use, which amplifies a significant unmet prevention need. In order to increase PrEP use with eligible
CBW, researchers must identify strategies with capacity to build a secure bridge of connection between CBW
and healthcare providers (HCPs) that can withstand formidable barriers to PrEP uptake (i.e. medical mistrust,
HCP bias and stigma). Support by HCPs who are knowledgeable, willing, and comfortable with prescribing and
referring PrEP to CBW is necessary to increase PrEP initiation among CBW. The primary objective of this R34
proposal is to increase willingness for PrEP initiation and PrEP initiation among CBW and increase willingness
to prescribe/refer PrEP to CBW among HCPs in Houston/Harris County, a high priority EHE jurisdiction.
 We hypothesize that a video-log (vlog) series-based health communication intervention disseminated
through community health centers (CHCs) and social media will increase PrEP initiation among CBW by
supporting both CBW and HCPs in a way that will foster PrEP access and uptake. Specifically, the
intervention will: 1) increase willingness to access and use PrEP among CBW and 2) increase willingness to
prescribe and refer PrEP to CBW among HCPs. Our team will explore two aims to 1) inform and develop
health messages for Project ROLE with 2023 findings from focus groups with PrEP-eligible CBW and key
informant interviews with HCPs providing care to CBW and 2) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary impact of Project ROLE in two real-world settings with a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) and
a social media campaign.
 The use of two ‘real-world’ settings to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this study is highly
innovative. The proposed research is significant because it will connect CBW to PrEP while increasing HCP
willingness to prescribe and refer PrEP to them using health communication that can guide the development of
subsequent vlog-based interventions to address the national EHE plan."

The aim of this phase 0/1 clinical trial is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of the novel, orally available,
blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrant imipridone ONC206 in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors
including diffuse midline gliomas (DMG). We show that ONC206 exerts its activity in DMGs and medulloblastoma
through activation of the mitochondrial protease ClpP, a serine protease that plays a central role in mitochondrial
protein quality control by degrading misfolded proteins. ClpP activation through ONC206 lead to apoptosis
involving upregulation of ATF4 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and induction of DR5 and TRAIL. In our
preliminary analyses, we have found that ClpP expression correlates with ONC206 response in vitro and that
ONC206’s effect is completely abrogated in H3K27M models with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. Our in vivo data
demonstrate that ONC206 leads to significant survival benefit in relevant in vivo model systems. Based upon
this exciting preliminary data, this will be the first study to test the safety and to determine the recommended
phase-2 dose (RP2D) of ONC206 as a single agent in pediatric patients including patients with DMGs and other
recurrent malignant brain tumors. Further, we will test ONC206 as single agent and in combination with radiation
in newly diagnosed and with re-irradiation in relapsed pediatric DMGs. We will assess the safety, PK profile and
preliminary efficacy of ONC206 in four different cohorts: (1) in newly diagnosed DMG, (2) in DMG patients who
completed radiation therapy, (3) in DMG patients at time of recurrence with re-irradiation and (4) other recurrent
malignant brain tumors. Using a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design the maximal sample size will be 3-42
per cohort. All cohorts will be expanded so that 12 patients per cohort have been treated at the RP2D. To
investigate the BBB penetration of ONC206, 40 patients will be treated at the RP2D in a phase 0 component of
the study, stratified by anatomic region since penetrance might differ based on tumor location (pontine, thalamic
vs. other locations). Within the confines of a phase 1 study, we will also assess progression fee and overall
survival. For each patient we will collect tumor tissue, CSF and serum for correlative studies with a focus CLpP
expression as a potential biomarker of response. We will also assess tumor circulating DNA as potential marker
for disease for treatment response. Further, we will assess quality of life and patient reported outcomes, which
is critically important but has not yet been done comprehensively in this patient population. This will be the first
study to comprehensively assess ONC206 in this pediatric patient population and will lay the groundwork for
future combination trials."
10917110,"A limited fundamental understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying complex behaviors
poses a major barrier for development of effective clinical applications to treat mental disorders. The long-term
goal of our research is to shed light on the gaps in knowledge regarding the molecular signatures and synaptic
properties of brain neuronal circuits that control responses to stress. Epigenetic gene regulation has emerged
as a key molecular driver underlying neuronal circuit dynamics and behavioral changes. Our preliminary data
suggest that CHD7, a chromatin-remodeling factor primarily expressed in the embryonic brain, remains enriched
in excitatory neurons within layer 2/3 of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in adult mice. The ACC, a region
within the medial prefrontal cortex in rodents, plays critical roles in processing mood-related information and
modulating anxiety-related behaviors. While critical roles for CHD7 during neural development have been well-
documented, its function in postmitotic neurons remains unclear. Our data suggest that postmitotic deletion of
Chd7 from ACC excitatory neurons (referred to as Chd7cKO) significantly reduced innate anxiety levels. In
addition, neuronal activity in the ACC of Chd7cKO mice exposed to an environmental stressor was significantly
lower than that in wild type (WT) mice. Intriguingly, these phenomena were observed only in male (and not
female) mice, indicating sexual dimorphism of CHD7 function. Our data provide the first evidence suggesting an
essential role for CHD7 in postmitotic ACC neurons in regulating neuronal activity and innate anxiety. Our primary
objectives are to interrogate the role of CHD7 in controlling a complex gene network to regulate the synaptic
activity of ACC neurons and their downstream targets. In this proposal, we will first determine how CHD7
regulates the activity of ACC neurons and their downstream targets in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
(BNST). Our preliminary data suggest that CHD7 plays a critical role in maintaining proper neuronal activity in
the ACC-BNST pathway. Next, we will use unbiased high-throughput approaches to determine how CHD7
controls a complex gene network in postmitotic neurons to regulate activity-dependent gene transcription. Finally,
we will investigate how CHD7 activity is regulated by an interacting partner that is involved in G protein signaling.
If successful, our research will shed new light on the molecular underpinnings and neurophysiology of neuronal
circuits that respond to stress. Such information will ultimately help define mechanisms underlying complex
emotional behaviors in humans."

An estimated 26% of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Botswana have hypertension. Uncontrolled
hypertension will add to the already increased risk for cardiovascular (CVD) disease in this population. A
hypertension study nested within an HIV prevention trial (Botswana Combination Prevention Project-
BCPP), the hypertension continuum of care was suboptimal among PLWHIV; 46% aware of their
hypertension, 42% on medication, 44% of those on medication at recommended blood pressure target, with
an overall hypertension control of 19%. These data highlight multiple implementation gaps in our setting
among PLWHIV for hypertension control and the missed opportunity to address CVD risk factors among
those with hypertension. These gaps occur despite national guidelines recommendations, free universal
healthcare, availability of needed medications and approaches which can improve quality including training,
coaching, and the use of electronic health records (EHR) reminders. Implementation research is urgently
needed to develop more effective strategies to improve the uptake of established effective hypertension
and CVDRF management interventions among PLWHIV in Botswana and other low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). We propose the adaptation and testing of strategies to effectively integrate evidence-
based interventions (EBI) into HIV care to improve hypertension cascade of care (awareness, diagnosis,
treatment, control) and general CVD risk factor knowledge, diagnosis and treatment using a late-stage T4
implementation research hybrid type 2 study design. First, we will develop a set of implementation
strategies for integrated HIV-HTN/CVD care within an existing HIV care platform for adults with HIV
and hypertension and pilot test (2 HIV Clinics) to explore implementation outcomes using RE-AIM
framework to inform adaptation for broader testing. We will use the knowledge gained from the
development and piloting of the implementation strategy to then use a type 2 hybrid design to measure
the implementation outcomes of multi-component strategy in improving EBI uptake and
improvement success rates in the HTN cascade among adults with a dual diagnosis of HIV and
Hypertension. To achieve this second aim, we are proposing a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation
of a 10-cluster randomized trial (1:1 randomization at the facility level) of 300 adults per cluster between 20-
75 years old with a dual diagnosis of HIV and hypertension (>140/90mmHg, >130/80mmHg if living with
Diabetes mellitus/Chronic Kidney Disease) in Botswana. Our primary quantitative implementation
outcomes based on the RE-AIM framework implementation are reach (proportion of PLWHIV on treatment
among those who meet threshold for anti-hypertensive medication), effectiveness (proportion with
controlled blood pressure), plus adoption (proportion of providers who screen PLWHIV for high blood
pressure plus proportion of providers who prescribe anti-hypertensive medications). Our co-primary
qualitative implementation outcomes will include assessment of fidelity (audit of intervention
implementation as designed) and maintenance (provider and patient perceptions of ability to maintain plus
change in blood pressure control from first control to end of the trial). Our secondary implementation
outcomes, we will include assessment of feasibility (ability to implement integrated HIV/HTN care,
HIV/HTN/CVD care, clinic viral suppression, etc.) and acceptability (patient and provider survey and
interviews) of the implementation strategy."

Clinical sequencing has only recently begun to inform the selection of FDA-approved therapies for individual
patients with prostate cancer. The recent FDA approvals of rucaparib and olaparib for men with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancers harboring alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes and of
pembrolizumab for microsatellite instability–high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors dictate that
somatic and germline DNA profiling are now required for the optimal standard care of men with advanced
prostate cancer. However, among patients with BRCA and other DNA repair pathway gene mutations, only a
subset—half at best—respond to approved targeted therapies. Similarly, only a subset of patients with MSI-H
prostate cancers will responds to pembrolizumab. In this project, we will leverage an institutional-scale
prospective tumor and germline sequencing initiative to expand our understanding of the impact of genomic
alterations on clinical outcomes and response to targeted and immune-based therapies in men with prostate
cancer. Our overarching aims are to identify genomic alterations associated with progression to the lethal
metastatic phenotype and to refine molecularly targeted approaches to the treatment of locally advanced and
metastatic prostate cancer. We will accomplish these translational objectives through three broad approaches:
1) We will develop the largest clinical genomic data set of men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer and
test the association of genomic alterations with clinical outcomes in this disease state. With a recurrence rate
of at least 40%, high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer represents an area of significant unmet need for
novel treatment approaches, including the introduction of targeted therapies and molecularly guided treatment
intensification to reduce the risk of recurrence. 2) We will identify molecular features of tumors with DDR
alterations that are more predictive of sensitivity or resistance to PARP inhibitors than DDR mutational status
alone. More specifically, we will use targeted and whole-genome sequencing analyses to explore the
associations between mutational zygosity, clonality, and the presence of structural variant signatures and
response to PARP inhibitor therapy. 3) We will determine the timing at which actionable DNA repair alterations
arise during prostate cancer disease progression and the impact of preexisting, intrapatient heterogeneity on
response to approved targeted and immunotherapies using sequential tumor and plasma sequencing. In sum,
on the basis of our institutional expertise in clinical molecular profiling, our ability to generate a prospective
data set of thousands of patients with prostate cancer treated with standard and investigational therapies, and
our experience in advancing the clinical development of targeted therapies in prostate cancer and other
malignancies, including leadership of the study that resulted in the first FDA approval of a PARP inhibitor for
prostate cancer, we are in an excellent position to develop and refine targeted treatment approaches that will
benefit men with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer."
10915672,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The majority of prostate cancers are dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling across clinical disease
states. While initially approved for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, recent phase III
trials have shown that second-generation AR pathway inhibitors (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide,
apalutamide, darolutamide) convey even greater benefit when used earlier in the disease course in patients
with metastatic hormone-sensitive and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Indeed, this
concept has also extended to the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with locally advanced high-grade primary
prostate cancer. However, despite potent AR inhibition, complete pathologic response rates have remained
low. Thus, there is a significant need to further define the mechanisms driving resistance to AR-targeted
therapies in this unique context and develop therapeutic strategies that enhance response rates in patients
with high-risk localized prostate cancer to shift the treatment paradigm from disease control to cure.
Through single-cell RNA sequencing studies of human and mouse prostates, we recently discovered that
neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is an AR-regulated gene in normal prostate stromal cells critical to sustaining survival of
normal luminal epithelial cells. Parallel studies in prostate cancer preclinical models revealed that stromal-
derived NRG1 in the prostate cancer microenvironment promotes cancer cell persistence following AR-
targeted therapies. Secreted NRG1 promotes resistance through HER2/3-PI3K/AKT-mediated signaling in
prostate cancer epithelial cells. We are now poised to define the NRG1 downstream signaling nodes driving
cancer cell persistence to AR targeted therapies and optimize therapeutic strategies targeting the NRG1 axis in
combination with AR inhibition. We will investigate the effects of targeting individual nodes of the NRG1-
HER2/3-PI3K pathway to overcome resistance to AR-targeted therapies in preclinical trials using clinical-grade
inhibitors of NRG1, HER2/3, PI3K, and AKT in combination with AR antagonists. Furthermore, in the proposed
project we will take a comprehensive approach to defining the microenvironmental mechanisms contributing to
prostate cancer cell persistence after AR-targeted therapy. Using single-cell sequencing technology, we will
define the changes in prostate cancer microenvironmental cell populations following AR inhibition and evaluate
differential gene expression within these cell populations to identify novel cytokine-receptor pairs contributing
to cancer cell persistence in primary and metastatic prostate cancers. Finally, we will conduct a phase Ib/II
neoadjuvant clinical trial of PI3K (copanlisib) and androgen-deprivation therapy prior to prostatectomy in
patients harboring loss of PTEN, an established mediator of resistance to AR-targeted therapies. Our collective
work will set the path for novel precision medicine–based neoadjuvant trials to improve the cure rates of men
with high-risk localized prostate cancer."
10914027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes an innovative surgical and bioengineering solution to the challenge of locoregional
recurrence for sarcomas. Locoregional recurrence (LRR) is the most common pattern of failure for
retroperitoneal, abdominal, and pelvic sarcomas. Despite a macroscopically complete resection, surgical
margins are frequently positive on final pathology due to large tumor size and anatomic complexity, resulting in
LRR rates of up to 40% even in leading referral centers with expertise in sarcoma. High mortality is commonly
due to locoregional disease rather than distant failure, and therefore strategies to improve survival must address
LRR. Trials evaluating perioperative and/or intraoperative external beam radiotherapy, single-dose hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy have all failed to demonstrate benefit. Our solution
is a surgically implantable buttress to locally deliver high concentrations of a chemotherapeutic drug to the
resection bed. Specifically, we describe the first example of an implantable, high-dose chemotherapeutic buttress
for biphasic extended paclitaxel (PTX) delivery post-resection. The buttress consists of a compliant
poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(1,2-glycerol carbonate) (PGC) polymer blend on a mesh, where PTX is both
physically entrapped within and site-specifically conjugated to PGC enabling concentrations as high as 3.3
mg/cm2 (supraPTX-buttress). The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that the dual release profile
combination of fast, but not burst, release of physically entrapped PTX followed by extended release of
covalently-bound PTX will: 1) reduce LRR rates and extend survival in patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
surgical models; and 2) be safe and feasible for locoregional drug delivery, achieving high local tissue
drug levels with minimal systemic delivery when implanted in a large animal along tissue planes and
vital structures commonly exposed during clinical cytoreductive sarcoma surgery. Importantly,
substantial preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous
experimental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise are in place
to address the hypotheses. supraPTX-buttresses provide an unprecedented opportunity to treat sarcomas with a
first-of-its-kind therapy. The specific aims of this five-year proposal are the following. Aim 1 characterizes the
PTX release kinetics as well as cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of supraPTX-buttresses against resected
patient-derived sarcomas in vitro. Aim 2 evaluates the efficacy of supraPTX-buttresses to prevent sarcoma
recurrence following resection in multiple PDX murine models with assessment of safety, local tissue healing,
and drug pharmacokinetics/biodistribution after film implantation. Aim 3 assesses the safety, feasibility,
perioperative morbidity, and systemic toxicity of supraPTX-buttress implantation in a pre-clinical large animal
model of retroperitoneal sarcoma surgery."
10914128,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The claustrum is a narrow, subcortical sheet of gray matter with interconnections across the cerebral cortex. Its
irregular shape and deep location make it difficult to study with classical neurophysiological techniques. Recent
genetic technologies such as optogenetics provide new hope for understanding the claustrum. They have
advanced its study in rodents, implicating the claustrum in an array of sensorimotor and cognitive functions.
Circuit-specific studies are needed to resolve how these functions map to the claustrum’s widespread
connections. Such studies would be especially valuable in macaque monkeys, the animal model most
homologous to humans. My overall goal is to translate viral technologies to monkeys and use them to study the
role of a specific claustrum-prefrontal cortical circuit in visuo-saccadic behavior. During systematic testing of viral
vectors in macaques, I identified a promising candidate for delivering opsin genes to the claustrum: the
retrograde virus rAAV2-retro. When injected into the frontal eye field (FEF), a prefrontal cortical area involved in
vision, movement, and cognition, rAAV2-retro constructs yielded strong labeling of FEF-projecting claustrum
neurons. This finding provides a long-sought, unique opportunity to study claustrum neurons with circuit-level
specificity in the primate brain. I propose to validate viral techniques in the claustro-FEF circuit and use them to
test my overall hypothesis that the claustrum mediates competitive selection of the most behaviorally relevant
stimulus via suppression of all other stimuli. To test my hypothesis, I have three integrated aims. In Aim 1, I will
conduct anatomical tracing studies to elucidate the motif of connectivity between the claustrum and FEF. In Aim
2, I will use rAAV2-retro to express an inhibitory opsin in FEF-projecting claustrum neurons. Then I will use
phototagging to identify those neurons and extracellularly record from them to characterize the signals sent from
the claustrum to the FEF during a battery of saccade tasks. In Aim 3, I will use the same inhibitory opsins to
selectively silence FEF-projecting claustrum neurons, allowing me to determine whether they are required for
competitive selection of saccade targets. The claustrum is implicated in a wide range of neurological diseases
and neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, the results of the proposed work will help reveal how pathological changes
to neural activity in the claustrum may contribute to brain disorders. In addition to its clinical relevance, the
proposed work will significantly expand my doctoral training to include neural recording and optogenetic methods
in non-human primates."
10914786,"Project Summary
 Mozambique has made progress towards their 95-95-95 goals, yet only 65% of people newly initiated in HIV
treatment remain in care at 12 months. HIV treatment adherence has been undermined by a lack of
compassionate health care service delivery. People living with HIV in our study region of Zambezia province
report being treated disrespectfully by health care workers as one of the leading causes of treatment
abandonment. Common complaints include insulting patients’ intellectual capacity, ignoring concerns with side
effects or co-occurring infections, and refusing to treat patients seen as “unworthy”. While health care worker
behavior is appalling, it is likely a reflection of high rates of burnout, job dissatisfaction, and frustration with
patients they perceive to be uncooperative.
 The implementation of Estamos Juntos (We are Together) will allow us to test a multiprong intervention
designed to address provider-barriers to delivering compassionate care via two synergistic components: (1)
Resilience and well-being training for health care providers who have expressed low job satisfaction, frustration
with delivering care in an extremely resource-limited setting, and burnout; and (2) Anti-stigma training for health
care providers who see those with low socioeconomic status, low levels of education, and those living with HIV
as “lesser-than” themselves. We propose to pilot test the implementation and impact of each psychosocial
intervention individually, and in combination, using a randomized controlled trial design at four health facilities.
We hypothesize that the facility where health care workers receive both resilience and anti-stigma training will
see the greatest change in health care worker outcomes, including decreased stigmatizing attitudes, emotional
exhaustion, and depersonalize of their patients, as well as increased resilience and job satisfaction. Patients
receiving care and treatment from intervention providers will show increased retention and medication
adherence, as well as improvements in health care services satisfaction, medical mistrust, and perceived stigma
from health care providers.
 The Specific Aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the impact of resilience training only, anti-stigma training
only, and resilience and anti-stigma training (vs. standard of care) on hypothesized mechanisms of behavior
change among health care providers employing the RE-AIM framework through a cluster randomized controlled
trial; and (2) Investigate the impact of provider training to reduce stigma and increase wellness and resilience on
patient adherence to HIV treatment.
 Our study team has more than a decade experience developing and testing HIV and associated mental health
interventions in Mozambique. If successful, our intervention can be tested through the R01 mechanism in a fully
powered trial designed to improve both provider and patient health outcomes."
10914822,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Reversible lysine methylation is well understood to regulate histone proteins and chromatin templated processes.
Dysregulation of the enzymes responsible for adding (lysine methyltransferases) and removing (lysine
demethylases) lysine methylation is directly associated with many human diseases. In addition to histone
proteins, thousands of non-histone proteins in the human proteome contain lysine methylation, yet we still
understand very little about the function of non-histone lysine methylation. Our long-term goal is to understand
how lysine methylation regulates non-histone protein function and cellular processes. Within this broad
framework, we strive to identify biological processes that are regulated by lysine methylation, the substrate
specificity of KMTs and KDMs, and how dysregulation of lysine methylation signaling contributes to human
disease and developmental disorders. Toward this goal, we recently developed a functional proteomics platform
to profile the substrate selectivity of KMTs and successfully used it to identify the circadian regulator PER2 as a
substrate of lysine methyltransferase SMYD2. We also recently optimized a mass spectrometry pipeline for high-
resolution mapping of lysine methylation. Over the next five years, we will build on this progress and use these
new methods in projects that seek to answer three fundamental questions in the context of the circadian clock
and neuronal differentiation: How big is the lysine methylome? What are the physiologically relevant substrates
for KMTs/KDMs? And what is the function of non-histone lysine methylation? We will answer these questions by
leveraging our strengths in biochemistry, proteomics, genomics, and cell-based studies, to expand our basic
mechanistic understanding of the function of lysine methylation in cellular processes."
10914947,"Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for a range of high-level cognitive functions, such as attention and decision-
making. Studying these processes is difficult, since they are covert, dynamic and under the control of the
subject, rather than the experimenter. Their measurement traditionally relies on inferring their presence via
behavior. Recent technical advances, particularly the increase in the number of neurons that can be
simultaneously recorded, has raised the possibility of decoding cognitive processes directly from neural activity.
In the proposed project, we will capitalize on the recent development of high-density, high-channel count, silicon
probes (Neuropixels) that can produce a more than 20-fold increase in neuronal-recording yield over
conventional methods. We will use these new probes and decoding algorithms to identify the cellular and circuit-
level mechanisms of attentional control and decision-making in primate PFC. We will perform this decoding in
real-time and use the output to control the application of stimulus perturbations or electrical microstimulation,
which will ‘close the loop’ and determine the necessity of the decoded signals for cognition. Finally, we will study
the contribution of specific subpopulations of neurons by restricting the decoder to those populations.
The first aim focuses on understanding how attentional control is achieved by lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC).
We will record simultaneously from large populations of neurons within the frontal eye field and area 46 of
monkeys performing a selective attention task. Neurons will be characterized by the laminar location, by their
sensory, motor and memory-related properties, and as putative pyramidal or interneurons. The contribution of
specific subpopulations to attentional control will be determined by building a decoder to report the animal’s
current attentional locus using neural activity from the subpopulation of interest. In turn, the decoder will be used
to control stimulus perturbations to assess the behavioral effect of the decoded signals on attention. In the
second aim, we will examine the contribution of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neuronal subpopulations to value-
based decision-making, including the contribution of different cortical layers, cell types, and OFC subregions.
In addition, the decoder output will be used to control the application of electrical microstimulation to examine
whether choice behavior can be biased towards a specific choice alternative. In the last Aim, we will build on
the work from the first two aims to determine how value and attention interact. While some evidence suggests
that attention is prioritized to stimuli with high value, other evidence suggests that the opposite is true. Results
from Aims 1 and 2 will be used to optimize a decoder in OFC that will output the value of objects currently under
consideration, and a decoder in LPFC that will output the current location of covert spatial attention. We will
then cross-correlate both decoder output signals to determine whether one reliably lags or leads the other.
The proposed work leverages the expertise of the three PIs: Moore is an expert in the role of LPFC in attention,
Wallis in the role of OFC in decision-making, and Shenoy in real-time decoding and closed-loop control."
10914959,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Health care algorithms make decisions that impact the lives of millions of
individuals, yet few are rigorously evaluated for systemic harms after they are implemented. Unfortunately,
these oversights have led to the perpetuation of health care disparities. In an effort to leap ahead of the
current state of the field and protect marginalized groups, our research would build a framework for
assessing the social impact of health care algorithms before they are deployed, which is a novel line of
investigation. This proposal is inherently interdisciplinary, spanning machine learning, ethical AI, health
economics, public health, decision sciences, statistics, health policy, and qualitative research. Mathematical
decision science microsimulation models will be developed, positing an underlying complex causal network
of the health care system. In order to initialize these microsimulation models, a diverse collection of data
sources will be used, including health care billing claims, policy intervention information, and community-
based qualitative feedback. A main priority is to prevent harm to racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with
disabilities, and older adults, among other marginalized groups. Primary outcomes under consideration
center health care access, quality, and costs. Robustness and rigor are central to our work. Despite no
comparator framework existing, we will additionally develop simpler causal network models along with
Markov cohort models to provide a basis for comparison. Outputs produced will also be freely shared with
the research and stakeholder communities in the form of open-source code and open-access preprints
featuring transparent descriptions of all models and assumptions. This work would involve a substantial shift
in focus for the Principal Investigator; pivoting to research that leverages mathematical decision science
modeling and qualitative approaches while merging them with her expertise in machine learning for health
care. Importantly, this framework has the potential to influence a new set of standards and guidelines for AI
algorithms, establishing a blueprint where tools are routinely evaluated for social impact before deployment.
Thus, creating this first-of-its-kind social impact framework could transform the development and application
of algorithms in health care, representing a substantial paradigm shift with broad impact."
10915413,"Project Abstract
Approximately 350,000 people suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year, with an average survival
rate with good neurological function of only 9.0%. In response to the clear public health imperative signaled by
these statistics, the Institute of Medicine in 2015 called for studies on implementation of interventions for
OHCA at the community, emergency medical services (EMS), and hospital levels. The lack of consistent use of
effective interventions across the country is largely due to the lack of high quality evidence from randomized
trials on how to implement these interventions at the systems (community) level. The proposed Regional
Approaches to Cardiovascular Emergencies- Cardiac ARreSt (RACE-CARS) cluster-randomized trial has been
designed to develop new systems-based high quality clinical trial evidence on how to improve outcomes for
OHCA. The premise for RACE-CARS is based on prior observations showing substantial regional
heterogeneity in care correlated with variations in outcomes. In 11 North Carolina counties, we observed
improved rates of bystander CPR and first responder defibrillation, associated with a 37% increase in survival
with good neurologic outcome over a 4-year period.
RACE-CARS, a 7-year pragmatic, cluster randomized (1:1) trial of 50 counties in NC, will test whether
implementation of a customized set of strategically targeted community-based interventions can improve
survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function in OHCA relative to control/standard care. Our
intervention program will consist of 4 main elements: (1) optimized medical 911-dispatch performance with
rapid recognition of cardiac arrest and dispatch of emergency response, (2) enhanced 911-dispatch telephone
coaching of bystander CPR, (3) improved first responder performance with AED use, and (4) comprehensive
public training of CPR and AED use. Quality of life and neurological functional status will be assessed at 6 and
12 months. RACE-CARS will leverage our statewide emergency care network, which has successfully
collaborated on improving quality of emergency cardiovascular care over the past 14 years, and ongoing data
collection of the majority of cardiac arrests in NC using the CARES registry. We will enroll ~20,000 patients
with cardiac arrest over the study period, to give us >90% power to detect a 30% increase in bystander CPR,
and 50% increase in bystander or first responder defibrillation, and > 85% power to detect a 33% increase in
survival with good neurologic outcome. While all the intervention approaches have evidence for improved
outcomes in prior observational studies, RACE CARS is unique in combining these efforts into a pragmatic
randomized systems-based implementation trial that can be adjusted to the needs and abilities/resources of
regions that vary according to population density, demographic and socioeconomic status.

10915697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) latently infects one-fourth of the world’s population, causing pulmonary
tuberculosis (TB) in ~10 million people and resulting in ~1.5 million deaths each year. The currently
available TB vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), shows variable efficacy. In addition, Multi-Drug-
Resistant (MDR) Mtb strains have recently emerged. Thus, there is a great need for new TB vaccines.
Studies in the past decade have mainly utilized induction of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses and the
production of the cytokine, Interferon-gamma (IFNγ), as readout for vaccine efficacy against TB. Our
studies during the prior funding period demonstrated that Interleukin (IL)-17 and T helper type 17 (Th17)
vaccine responses are critical for vaccine-induced immunity against TB. Importantly, we recently
demonstrated that mucosal vaccination with the Mtb antigen with Th17-inducing adjuvants induced potent
lung-resident Th17 cells and improved BCG vaccine-induced protection following Mtb challenge. Our
mechanistic studies demonstrated that IL-17-induced chemokines, including CXCL-13, localize CXCR5-
expressing T cells near Mtb-infected macrophages, resulting in the formation of lung lymphoid follicles and
activating macrophages to mediate Mtb control. Despite these major advances in understanding the role of
Th17 vaccine-induced cells in TB, our data show that upon Mtb infection, the accumulation of vaccine-
induced Th17 immune responses in the lung is not accelerated enough to provide “sterilizing” immunity or
complete Mtb control. In exciting new data generated during the prior funding cycle, we show that we can
overcome this bottleneck by using Dendritic Cell (DC) based therapy by either activating endogenous DCs,
or transfer of exogenously activated DCs into vaccinated hosts, to achieve superior Mtb control. Thus, the
work proposed in this R01 renewal builds on these important and highly relevant findings with three
Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Identifying the early cytokine pathways that modulate APC function to
promote Th17 responses and induce superior immunity against TB. Specific Aim 2. Identifying the IL-23
and IL-17-dependent mechanisms that mediate early Th17 responses and Mtb control. Specific Aim 3.
Identification of novel C-type lectin receptor agonists as Th17-inducing TB vaccines. The emergence of
extensively drug-resistant strains (XDR) of Mtb, for which no treatments currently exist, makes the
development of an effective TB vaccine incredibly urgent. The work proposed in this grant will continue to
significantly impact the design and use of future vaccine strategies by allowing us to promote IL-17
responses to generate improved, long-term lasting vaccine-induced immunity against TB."

Incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide. The causative mechanisms
involved in the disease pathogenesis are currently elusive. However, induced pathogenic inflammation due to
malnutrition, impacting the ileal epithelium homeostasis, may contribute to disease manifestation. Thus,
understanding the dietary risk factors involved in pediatric IBD is urgent. Diet containing micronutrients (e.g.,
vitamins) functionally controls the genomic mechanisms of the neonatal intestinal cells. Deficiency in host
nutritional circuitry, notably during the pre and postnatal periods of pregnancy may not only impair the host-
bacteria interaction controlling the gut homeostasis but also deteriorate the metabolic networks required for
bacterial syntrophic growth. Vitamin B12 (VB12) is synthesized by some intestinal bacteria. VB12 deficiency may
dysfunction ileal epithelial cells (iECs) expressing VB12 receptors (e.g., cubilin, megalin) with severe intestinal
disorders post-birth. We recently reported that the newly discovered Propionibacterium strain, P. UF1, regulates
phagocytic and protective T cell responses to intestinal pathogen infection in newborn and adult mice. Further,
P. UF1 produces VB12 and crucially controls the biosynthesis of this vitamin through a novel putative riboswitch,
cbiMCbl. We now demonstrate that VB12 critically controls ileal epithelial cell (iEC) molecular and metabolic
homeostasis, particularly the mitochondrial respiration, to potentially limit aerobic Salmonella (STm) infection in
newborn mice. The objectives of this research proposal are to further elucidate that (a) VB12 functionally sustains
iEC function during STm infection, (b) VB12 regulates oxygen levels in iECs resulting in luminal hypoxia that
controls aerobic STm infection and (c) VB12 fortifies ileal epithelium integrity and supports effector T helper (Th)
cell response to STm challenge. The overarching hypotheses are: (1) VB12 reprograms the molecular machinery
of iECs during STm infection, (2) regulation of ileal oxygenation by VB12 induces the luminal hypoxia that limits
the aerobic STm infection and (3) controlling iEC-function by VB12 contributes to epithelial integrity and
protective Th cell response to aerobic STm infection. The following Specific Aims will test these hypotheses: 1.
Elucidate the molecular mechanisms sustaining iEC function by VB12 during STm infection. 2. Elaborate on the
mitochondrial oxygen regulation in iECs by VB12 controlling aerobic STm infection. And 3. Investigate barrier
integrity regulation by VB12 and protective Th cell response to STm infection. Results obtained from the
proposed mechanistic studies will be the first in-depth report underscoring VB12 potency in regulating iEC
function for a sustainable therapeutic strategy that could potentially improve neonatal health."
10928188,"Discrimination is nearly pervasive, with Black youth averaging five experiences of racial discrimination 
daily. Discrimination is a determinant of health for historically marginalized populations, and linked to 
decreased psychological, physical, and emotional functioning, negative affective states, and increased 
health risk behaviors such as substance use and maladaptive eating. Black youth also have been identified 
as particularly disadvantaged because of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of certain psychiatric disorders, 
underdiagnosis of others, and limited access to mental health treatment. With the additional stressor of 
experiencing discrimination and mental health care inequities, Black youth are at increased risk for 
engaging in health risk behaviors. Unfortunately, most screening tools and interventions fail to account for 
the lived experiences of Black youth and are based on and provided primarily for White youth. The 
proposed project seeks to develop, refine, and test a culturally appropriate theoretical model of the 
contexts (social, emotional) in which discrimination and health risk behaviors occur among Black youth 
while considering intersectionality. Specific Aim 1 will explore the contexts (social, emotional) in which 
discrimination and health risk behaviors occur in Black youth while considering intersectionality and 
develop an ecological assessment protocol. To test this aim, up to 30 Black adolescents aged 14-17 years 
with substance use and/or maladaptive eating behaviors will be recruited to complete focus groups and a 
survey. Drawing on qualitative data, an ecological momentary assessments protocol will be developed and 
refined. Specific Aim 2 will explore whether the ecological momentary assessment protocol accurately 
captures the contexts in which discrimination and health risk behaviors occur in Black youth. To test this 
aim, up to 30 Black adolescents aged 14-17 years with substance use and/or maladaptive eating behaviors 
will be recruited to complete focus groups and a survey. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the feasibility and 
acceptability of the ecological momentary protocol with a subset of 10 Black youth. This study fills a 
fundamental gap by being one of the first to refine and test a culturally appropriate theoretical model of 
health risk behaviors in Black youth and one of the first to consider intersectionality. Findings from this 
study will provide specific insight into how to adapt screening tools and interventions for health risk 
behaviors in Black youth to be more culturally appropriate."

Many pregnant women have experienced trauma, which can make perinatal care stressful and increase the
risk of pregnancy-related health conditions. However, obstetric providers can modify procedures to reduce
distress and enhance patients’ sense of control and safety. Although obstetric providers frequently care for
trauma survivors, most are not trained in trauma-informed care (TIC). Additionally, there are no data on
feasibility, appropriateness, or acceptability of TIC tools and interventions in the context of obstetrics. The goal
of the proposed K23 project is to develop the first, stakeholder-informed obstetric TIC toolkit composed of
treatment protocols, clinician training, trauma and violence screening tools, and other resources to help
obstetric providers apply TIC practices to all clinical interactions in addition to identifying and providing support
for trauma survivors. The obstetric TIC intervention toolkit (OB-TIC) will be developed in collaboration with key
stakeholders (pregnant and postpartum patients, nurses, physicians, and administrators) to ensure that it is
feasible, acceptable, appropriate, cost-effective, and clinically useful. Current practices and preferences will be
characterized in qualitative interviews with stakeholders which will inform the development of OB-TIC in
collaboration with a community working group of stakeholders. A pilot implementation trial of OB-TIC will be
conducted in two outpatient obstetrics clinics to gather real-world data that will inform the final intervention
toolkit, which will be tested on a larger scale in future (R01) studies. The K23 award will facilitate the
candidate’s transition towards an independent research career focused on improving the well-being of women
through trauma-informed perinatal healthcare and implementation science, which is directly in line with the
NICHD pregnancy and perinatology priority of “improving the health of women before, during, and after
pregnancy.” To date, the candidate’s training has focused on developing clinical expertise in perinatal
behavioral medicine, and research experience in obstetrics, perinatal stress, and behavioral interventions for
stress and discrimination. The K23 award will provide protected time for training in 1) implementation science
methodology focused on the development of stakeholder informed interventions and scale-up and spread of
evidence-based interventions; 2) qualitative research methodology, a foundational component of
implementation science and stakeholder-based intervention development; 3) and trauma-informed care in
obstetrics, which will provide a knowledge base for OB-TIC. Experts in each of the key training domains will
provide individual mentorship in addition to specialized workshops and didactics. During the proposed K23
award, the candidate will be a Research Scientist at The Miriam Hospital and an Assistant Professor at Brown
University. This environment is rich with innovation and collaboration and will enhance the candidate’s training
and facilitate their research goals. The mentorship and skills gained as part of this K23 award, will prepare the
candidate to pursue funding for an R01 focused on a randomized controlled trial of OB-TIC."

During meiosis, crossing-over between homologs facilitates accurate chromosome segregation and prevents
aneuploidy, which in turn forestalls miscarriages and chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome. The
regulation and placement of meiotic crossovers acts as a vital safeguard against age-associated meiotic
defects and infertility, as the risk of non-disjunction (NDJ) increases with increasing maternal age.
Meiotic crossovers (COs) are formed when programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired through
homologous recombination. However, only a subset of DSBs are repaired to form COs; the rest are repaired as
non-crossovers (NCOs). Despite meiotic DSBs being distributed throughout the chromosome, CO placement is
intricately regulated by three types of patterning phenomena. One of these, the centromere effect (CE), ensures
the exclusion of COs in centromere-proximal regions and is crucial to the meiotic cell as centromere-proximal
COs increase the risk of NDJ. Furthermore, increasing maternal age has been shown to weaken the CE,
potentially explaining why NDJ incidence increases in older women. Although first observed in Drosophila
in 1932, the mechanisms behind the CE remain unknown even today. The experiments proposed here aim to
address this gap in knowledge regarding a vital cellular process that prevents mis-segregation events,
especially in those with advanced maternal age. Recently, our lab showed that the CE is differentially
established in the two classes of heterochromatin found at the Drosophila pericentromere. In the highly repetitive
alpha heterochromatin immediately adjacent to the centromere, a complete exclusion of COs is observed, while
the less repetitive beta heterochromatin adjacent to proximal euchromatin shows a distance dependent CO
suppression. I will build on these results by investigating the mechanisms of how the CE is established
in these two classes of pericentric heterochromatin. A prominent question regarding CE mechanisms
centers around how pericentromeric heterochromatin and the centromere itself contribute to the CE. The few
studies that have addressed pericentric crossing-over in the past century have attempted to establish one as
more important than the other in Drosophila but failed to arrive at a consensus. Thus, pericentric heterochromatin
has been considered everything from an active participant in CO reduction in adjacent intervals to nothing more
than a passive spacer between euchromatin and the centromere. Through the experiments outlined in this
proposal, I will ask how pericentric heterochromatin and the centromere contribute to the CE
independently of each other, particularly focusing on highly repetitive alpha heterochromatin.
Investigating the role of alpha heterochromatin as separate from that of pericentric heterochromatin as a whole
in manifesting the CE is a novel area of research within the broader question of how the CE is established. In
summary, this proposal will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that safeguard against age-
related aneuploidy and infertility through shedding light on meiotic crossover patterning."

 The Center for Perceptual Systems (CPS) is an interdisciplinary program at the University of Texas that
provides a focal point for research and training in sensory systems. Continued growth in the Neurosciences at
UT, as well as in CPS, particularly in the area of vision research, has lead to the development of a distinctive
group in the Center that has a broad interdisciplinary research program in vision, representing psychophysical,
neurophysiological, imaging, and computational approaches. Additionally, we have distinctive expertise and
resources for the investigation of vision in the context of natural environments, and the development of
computational tools for neural modeling and for modeling visually guided behavior. Because of both our broad
expertise and our special strengths in these areas we are well positioned to train new scientists who will be at
the forefront of vision research in the future. There are three important components to our training focus. First,
we take advantage of the highly interdisciplinary and collaborative structure of CPS to provide broad cross-
disciplinary training, which we consider essential for students of vision and visual performance. Second, we
believe that training in computational methods is an essential component of research in vision and we take
advantage of our particular strengths in this area. Third, we take advantage of our strengths in the analysis of
natural behavior and environments to provide a unique training opportunity in an area that is becoming
increasingly important for a broad understanding of vision. These components lie at the core of our program,
which includes basic courses, specialized seminars, training in advanced methodologies, attendance at the CPS
colloquium series and the CPS symposium on Natural Environments, Tasks, and Intelligence, ethics training,
and the development of professional skills."

Abstract
The Interdisciplinary Biomedical Imaging Training Program will prepare predoctoral trainees to become leaders
in organism-level, biomedical imaging technology and application research. Multi-disciplinary teams of engi-
neers, physicists, biologists, and clinicians are required to advance biomedical imaging, especially with the ad-
vent of in vivo cellular and molecular imaging. We will create the next generation of interdisciplinary biomedical
imaging scientists and engineers who will contribute to and lead such teams. Our training program will build
upon continuing, significant institutional, state, federal, and commercial investment in faculty and imaging infra-
structure. A training grant award will place students squarely in the center of on-going interdiscipli-
nary/multidisciplinary research programs. Trainees will use imaging facilities in the Case Center for Imaging
Research which includes state-of-the-art clinical and preclinical imaging systems, along with labs of mentoring
faculty. Predoctoral trainees will be from the highly-rated departments of Biomedical Engineering and Physics,
both of which have a long history of training in biomedical imaging. Trainees will conduct research projects
combining enabling technologies in imaging with biomedical research. Each trainee will have two or more men-
tors representing both imaging technology and biological/clinical applications of imaging. Our educational pro-
gram includes a portfolio of imaging courses, including ones focusing on imaging physics, image analysis, and
reconstruction, as well as nanomedicine. We will promote a culture of interdisciplinary research during a desig-
nated Imaging Hour. Our T32 has enabled us to increase recruitment of women and under-represented minori-
ties. In general, it has helped make graduate students cost effective as compared to post docs and ensured
training of domestic PhD’s in this area of critical need. In less than nine years, our T32 program has already
successfully trained several graduates, all with exemplary training records and with a trajectory towards suc-
cess. Other trainees are moving through the program focusing on exciting interdisciplinary imaging research
and with excellent research productivity."
10917177,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 2
SLE has high morbidity and limited treatment options. ~30% of patients fail to respond to the standard-of-care
(SOC) treatment, composed of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Glucocorticoids (GCs), and mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF). Another ~30% of patients initially respond with a decreased activity index (SLEDAI) and a decrease in
plasmablasts (PBs), but subsequently become refractory to treatment. The biological mechanisms that underlie
this lack of response to treatment are poorly understood. Thus, to progress towards improved clinical
management of SLE especially in the ~60% of SLE patients who currently do not have effective treatment options
in the long term, the goal of Project 2 is to delineate the mechanisms of resistance to SOC therapy and to identify
novel targets for therapeutic intervention. In the previous CORT funding cycle, we focused on characterizing the
transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a cross-sectional pediatric SLE patient
cohort using single-cell (sc) RNAseq and long-read (LR) sequencing technologies. We found that multiple cell
types -- monocytes, dendritic cells, plasma cells (PCs), and subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells -- exhibit an
interferon (IFN) signature. LRseq uncovered >250 isoforms unique to SLE, which include several cell surface
molecules with immune regulatory functions. Preliminary data from 11 patients from a longitudinal cohort showed
that a high SLEDAI at diagnosis correlates with elevated numbers of PBs. Importantly, transcriptional profiling of
pre-therapy samples suggested that the PBs of non-responder (NR) patients are distinct from those of responder
(R) patients, including increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in R-PBs. Finally, we have used
bulk and single-nucleus (sn) ATAC-seq to identify epigenomic signatures of SLE. Here, we will combine single-
cell approaches in an expanded longitudinal cohort with functional genomics to uncover treatment resistance
pathways in SLE and novel therapeutic targets. In Aim 1, we will identify SOC resistance pathways at the single-
cell transcriptional level using blood samples collected longitudinally from 30 SLE patients identified at the onset
of disease and followed over at least 3 years. We will uncover transcriptional signatures of therapy resistance
by performing Total-seq and identify isoforms associated with disease severity and response to treatment. In
Aim 2, we will uncover epigenomic signatures and regulatory elements associated with SLE and therapy
resistance using single-nucleus ATACseq and link these to transcriptional programs identified in Aim 1.
Longitudinal samples are essential for determining whether disease-specific genomic signatures change upon
treatment and/or during flares. In Aim 3, we will characterize the phenotype of therapy-resistant PBs and apply
CRISPR-Cas9 functional genomics approaches to validate candidate molecules that confer resistance to
therapy. Successful completion of Project 2 will identify transcriptional and epigenomic signatures of therapy
resistance in SLE PBMCs, complemented by focused functional studies in PBs, a cell population critical in SLE,
to deliver potential novel therapeutic targets especially for individuals resistant to SOC."

10917409,"Project 1 SUMMARY
 A clearer understanding of how tumor cells survive the stress of platinum agents and evolve into
therapy resistant populations is essential to overcome treatment failure and maximize both disease control and
survival. Our data demonstrate that HNSCC cell lines with acquired cisplatin resistance reduce glycolytic and
mitochondrial energy production while increasing carbon flux into anabolic pathways. This results in an
enhanced reductive potential (glutathione, NAD(P)H, FADH2) via both glucose and glutamine catabolism
coupled to increased glutathione (GS) peroxidase 2 (GPX2) activity coordinated at a genomic and
transcriptional level, partially through the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Hyperactivation of GPX2 concomitantly
likely inhibits NF-κB activation, decreasing chemokine and prostaglandin production by tumor cells— leading
to a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) enriched for myeloid derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) and depleted of cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). It is our central hypothesis that this
metabolic adaptation is a permissive and required step for acquisition of cisplatin resistance. We
further postulate that this metabolic shift transitions some tumors to an immunologically silent phenotype,
which reduces immune surveillance to compound the aggressive behavior and cross-therapy resistance of
CDDP-treated tumors
 We will first define the critical metabolic steps required for generation of an enhanced reductive state
that supports cisplatin resistance in Aim 1. We will utilize in vitro and in vivo orthotopic HNSCC models to
measure the contribution of glucose and glutamine to GS synthesis in cisplatin resistant tumors and, using
chemical inhibition coupled to shRNA blockade of individual transporters and enzymes, identify the critical
rate limiting metabolic steps for GS synthesis and cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. In Aim 2 we will
determine how GS synthesis and utilization (by GPX2 and non GPX means) are coordinated transcriptionally
at least in part through Nrf2 in order to support cisplatin resistance. In Aim 3 we will test the impact of GS
metabolism via canonical (e.g. NF-kB) and metabolic paracrine signaling on development of a suppressive
TIME.
 Completion of the proposed experiments will: 1) identify suitable targets for ablation of the
enhanced reductive state driving cisplatin resistance in HNSCC and 2) identify metabolic biomarkers which can
be coupled to 13C flux imaging-based measurements to generate real-time readout of tumor treatment
response, and inform a more personalized approach to targeting metabolism to overcome CDDP resistance.
By identifying the critical mechanistic underpinnings of metabolic adaptation, we can generate a paradigm
shift in our capability to both rapidly detect acquisition of resistance to genotoxic stress and to overcome it
using multiple clinically viable approaches. It will further shed light on how acquisition of cisplatin
resistance can impact response to immunomodulatory approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) currently being combined with chemotherapy in the clinic."
10917410,"Project 2 SUMMARY
 Cisplatin (CDDP) is frontline therapy for both Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positive and negative head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Unfortunately, there are no reproducible predictors of CDDP
HNSCC response and patients develop acquired resistance and even distant metastasis following a course of
this often toxic chemotherapy. To better understand and tackle the clinical problem of CDDP treatment failure,
we developed multiple cell line models of acquired CDDP resistance in the laboratory using established HNSCC
tumor lines with different genomic backgrounds and TP53 mutational and functional status. Surprisingly, nearly
every CDDP resistant clone developed from these various genomic driver backgrounds had hyperactivation of
the Nrf2 pathway either due to de novo somatic mutations in, or decreased RNA expression of, KEAP1 (negative
regulator of Nrf2). Nrf2 activation has been linked to poor prognosis, lack of response to immune therapy,
metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. We demonstrated that Nrf2 hyperactivation was necessary to
maintain acquired resistance, raising the possibility that the pathway could be clinically targeted to reverse or
prevent acquired CDDP resistance in HNSCC. By targeting glutaminase 1 (GLS) with a novel drug, pools of
glutathione needed for Nrf2 activity are depleted leading to a reversal of CDDP resistance.
 In parallel, we showed that paracrine signaling between sensory neurons that become reprogramed in
the tumor microenvironment can foster CDDP resistance and that it may be possible to pharmacologically inhibit
this signaling axis to boost CDDP sensitivity and tumor progression. Furthermore, data from our preclinical model
suggest that Nrf2 activation accompanying CDDP resistance may also lead to more aggressive disease by
increasing the rate of distant metastasis. While Nrf2 hyperactivation is likely a permissive and required step to
acquired CDDP resistance, there may also be Nrf2 independent pathways contributing to resistance. Our central
hypothesis is that Nrf2 hyperactivation either through somatic mutation for transcriptional control is a common
and targetable event in development of acquired CDDP resistance across a range of genomic backgrounds. To
bridge knowledge gaps in the pervasiveness of the Nrf2 pathway in development of CDDP resistance and tumor
progression and ways to overcome treatment failure we propose the following Aims: 1) Define the contribution
of Nrf2-dependent and-independent pathways to acquired CDDP resistance in HNSCC; 2) Delineate the
functional and mechanistic interactions between acquired CDDP resistance, Nrf2 activation, neuronal
reprograming in the tumor microenvironment, and DM; 3) Determine whether acquired CDDP resistance and
tumor progression can be overcome by drugs targeting metabolism or stabilizing p53. Accomplishment of these
Aims should yield translatable findings that will improve the treatment of patients with HNSCC and the related
upper-aerodigestive tract cancers of the lung and esophagus and therefore have a major impact on cancer
worldwide."
10917411,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Cisplatin (CDDP) remains the gold-standard for chemotherapeutic treatment for multiple solid tumors, including
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). High rates of treatment failure result from the development
of acquired resistance following this relatively toxic chemotherapy. Despite the frequent use of CDDP, no robust
predictors of tumor response or development of acquired resistance exist. Treatment failure is uniformly fatal.
Given the critical unmet need for predictors of tumor response and acquired resistance, we have focused our
efforts on the assessment of tumor response with minimally invasive imaging (hyperpolarized magnetic
resonance imaging; HP-MRI) and detection of biological shifts in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) while patients
are undergoing cisplatin-based therapy. We have shown that CDDP and other genotoxic agents trigger
measurable fluctuations in tumor cell metabolism detectable by both conventional biochemical assays and HP-
MRI with [1-13C]-pyruvate. The recycling of key coenzymes in several reductive metabolic pathways links the
effects of genotoxic stress to carbon flux from pyruvate into lactate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). We
previously showed that genotoxic agents alter the intracellular redox state, shift pyruvate/lactate metabolism,
and suppress the apparent rate of pyruvate conversion to lactate (kPL) in a manner that correlates with anti-tumor
effectiveness. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of regulatory shifts associated with the acquisition of cisplatin
resistance in CTCs will re-enforce the imaging-based quantification of cisplatin sensitivity and resistance. Based
on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming driven by Nrf-2 in cisplatin-
resistant HNSCC is detectable using a combination of non-invasive imaging of carbon flux (kPL- via HP-
MRI) and scCTC analysis. To assess this premise, we will use well-characterized preclinical models of HNSCC
that are sensitive and resistant to cisplatin. Alterations in glycolytic metabolism will be measured at baseline and
following cisplatin administration through hyperpolarized imaging and biochemical assays. These measurements
will be validated with biochemical assays in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1). We will also measure treatment response
in HNSCC patients relative to alterations in tumor kPL by acquiring HP-MRI data prior to and following induction
chemotherapy (Aim 2). Biological confirmation will be performed in CTCs to identify biomarkers associated with
cisplatin resistance through genomic and transcriptomic analysis. Successful completion of this study will
establish HP-MRI as a minimally invasive imaging approach to characterize relative tumor resistance to cisplatin
and provide real-time feedback to optimize treatment. CTC biomarker analysis will provide critical biological
support for the imaging findings. This work has the potential to change the basis for clinical decision-making
regarding the use of cisplatin in HNSCC and related aerodigestive tract cancers. As a noteworthy first step
towards a precision oncology approach, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission that
pertains to developing and applying fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human illness."
10921893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The primary goal of this application is to sustain the Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) program at the Caribbean
Primate Research Center (CPRC) through the support of operations, administration, veterinary care, virological
and MHC typing, and by the improvement of our comprehensive genetic management plan. Animals'
characterization, both for the virology profile and MHC typing, is performed by state-of-the-art methodologies.
A unique feature of CPRC animals in favoring a successful establishment and sustainability of SPF colony is that
these animals are naturally free of SIV and SRV-D, two of the four viruses to be tested. Nevertheless, we continue
systematically testing for all four viruses (B virus, STLV, SIV, and SRV-D) for safety and as required for the SPF
Program. The Program provides unadmixed Indian-origin rhesus monkeys with a defined genetic and virological
background. The population genetic analyses revealed that the SPF colony has remained genetically homogenous
over time with sufficient heterozygosity and minimal stratification from its non-SPF founders. Genetic variation
will be maintained in the SPF colony using the genetic management strategies described in this application. The
genetic management approach will allow for the enrichment of desired MHC markers in demand for biomedical
research while maintaining genetic diversity. Our genetic management approach will be concordant with the
NIH's National NHP Genetics and Genomics Consortium guidelines for ensuring the long-term viability of the
CPRC's SPF colony. The estimates of Indian ancestry among the SSFS SPF colony animals are also among the
highest that has been calculated across several National Primate Research Centers in the US. Funds are requested
in this application to sustain the SPF program and to meet the proposed aims. With continued NIH support,
Institutional contribution, and funds from the program income, the SPF program at CPRC will remain a
significant national research resource. They will be able to provide healthy SPF Indian-origin rhesus monkeys of
defined genetic and virological background to NIH-sponsored research programs. The Covid-19 pandemic poses
high pressure on the demand for rhesus macaques. The U42 at CPRC supported the development of some of the
Covid-19 vaccine formulations in the market. Currently, the demand continues to exceed the SPF animal's
availability. However, our Program has supported several investigators conducting cutting-edge research on HIV
and AIDS-related research projects in various areas, including pathobiology, characterization of the immune
response, con-infections, and comorbidities, development of new HIV/AIDS vaccines and therapeutic
approaches, including microbicides, among others."
10921895,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Continuous testing for certain viruses that can compromise HIV research results, is essential in any SPF Program
used for this purpose. The CPRC-SPF colony is free and systematically assayed for Simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV), Type D Simian retrovirus (SRV-D) and Simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV-1). The colony is also
free of Herpes B virus, which represents an occupational health risk for the personnel handling the animals. The
primary purpose of the virology testing arm of CPRC-SPF breeding program is to assure that its Indian-origin
rhesus macaque colony, supporting NIH-sponsored research specially on HIV/AIDS, is free of the above-
mentioned viruses. An advantage of this program is that it has been closed to external individuals since 2016.
Certainly, this aspect substantially decreases the risks of the re-introduction of any of the four tested viruses from
an external source. The specific aim of the Viral Testing Core is: Sustain the implementation of the reliable viral-
testing algorithm to continue producing high quality SPF animals with a well-defined virological status in
support of PHS-NIH sponsored biomedical research, especially HIV/AIDS studies."

Our studies over the past two decades have focused on clarifying the mechanisms by which anti-tumor
immunotherapies elicit their therapeutic effects. As a result of our studies, the importance of Fc-FcγR mediated
effector pathways for the elimination of tumors has been elucidated, resulting in the optimization of these
interactions in second-generation anti-tumor immunotherapeutics with improved clinical activity. One of the
therapies developed as part of our previously funded NCI studies is now being tested across three clinical trials
with early evidence of promising activity. While strategies improving antibody-based therapeutics through Fc
engineering have resulted in more effective anti-tumor antibodies (Abs) with significantly improved survival, the
long-term goal of immunotherapy is to develop therapeutic strategies that will elicit memory responses and
effectively eliminate recurrences, resulting in improvements in overall survival. This current proposal aims to
mechanistically investigate general strategies to accomplish this goal by focusing on 1) inducing tumor
vaccination using anti-tumor monoclonal Abs (mAbs), 2) define the mechanisms by which agonistic and
antagonistic immunomodulatory mAbs enhance anti-tumor vaccination, and 3) explore how the tumor
microenvironment may be manipulated to improve these immunotherapeutic strategies. Our preliminary results
have indicated that anti-tumor Abs can elicit long-term cellular memory responses when appropriate Fc-FcγR
interactions are integrated into these Abs. Manipulating both the cellular effector responses and the tumor
microenvironment through the use of Fc-optimized immunomodulatory Abs can further augment these
pathways and result in long-term memory responses."

Candidate: Courtney Streur, MD, MS is a pediatric urologist and junior health services researcher focused on
understanding the sexual health and education of adolescents with physical disabilities. Dr. Streur’s long-term
career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator who develops, implements, and disseminates
interventions that promote the healthy sexual development of adolescent girls with physical disabilities to
improve their long-term sexual health outcomes.
Research Context: Adolescent girls with physical disabilities are not educated about their sexual health, which
has led to unintended pregnancies, low contraceptive use, and sexual coercion and abuse. Aspects of their
physical disability and medical comorbidities impact their sexual health (e.g., precocious puberty, incontinence
during intercourse). Additionally, the cognitive disability frequently associated with their physical disability
(e.g., executive functioning impairment) impacts their ability to learn and develop new skills. Therefore,
adolescent girls with disabilities need tailored sexual health education. The goal of this study is to create and
refine a novel, user-centered online sexual health curriculum. This will be tailored to girls with spina bifida and
expanded to other girls with disabilities, implemented, and disseminated as a subsequent R01.
Specific Aims: 1) Discover and rigorously define the highest-priority sexual health knowledge and skill
attainment needs and learning style of adolescent girls with spina bifida. 2) Design and beta-test an online
sexual health intervention prototype targeted to adolescent girls with spina bifida that improves their sexual
health knowledge and self-management skill development. 3) Perform a pilot evaluation of the intervention
prototype on key implementation outcomes.
Research Plan: This uses a mixed methods implementation science approach. First we will build on existing
preliminary data from adolescent girls with spina bifida, parents of girls with spina bifida, and experts in the
field regarding the educational needs and learning style of the girls to inform creation of best-worst scaling
surveys. The surveys will be administered to females with spina bifida ages 10-19 and parents of girls with
spina bifida to identify the highest priority learning needs and best format of the intervention. This information
will be used to create the first version of the curriculum, which will be refined through beta testing on dyads of
adolescent girls with spina bifida and their parents. Finally, using the RE-AIM framework, we will conduct a
pilot study on dyads of girls with spina bifida and their parents to evaluate key implementation measures,
including reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance.
Career Development Plan: In parallel with this research plan and under the guidance of experienced mentors,
Dr. Streur will develop expertise in intervention design and implementation and dissemination science."

Given modern history’s advancements in molecular biology, from the exponential decrease in the
costs of genome sequencing, nucleotide synthesis, and genome editing (CRISPR), synthetic
biology is poised to be the next major revolution in technological advancements. The White House
has recognized this trend in its 2019 Bioeconomy Summit, emphasizing the need for developing
a robust bioeconomy and training the next generation workforce to carry it forward. However,
research and education in synthetic biology has remained predominant in well-funded graduate
research institutes with easy access to commercial equipment and training. Those in high schools
and undergraduate pathways have not seen the same accessibility despite them being the prime
target for advancement into research careers and extensive research indicates the value in
diversification of the workforce. A key bottleneck for enabling hands-on training in synthetic
biology is lack of affordable hardware, especially in budget-conscious high school laboratories.
Recent initiatives in frugal science have attempted to address some of these bottlenecks with
notable frugal inventions including the 20-cent paper centrifuge, 23-cent electroporator, and 1-
dollar microscope, to name a few. The proposed work will develop a Frugal Science Academy, a
first-of-its-kind, to i) train underrepresented groups (URM) in K-12 STEM to conduct their own
research in synthetic/molecular biology by developing their own frugal tools and gain research
experiences often exclusive to well-equipped universities, and ii) to develop professional
development courses and bootcamps to train rural Georgia high-school teachers with frugal
hardware to conduct their own molecular biology experiments and introduce synthetic biology
components to their existing curricula.
Overall, the success of the Frugal Science Academy will help introduce younger innovators and
inventors to the rapidly expanding field of synthetic biology, empower them to conduct their own
biomedical research and biological research by breaking down cost barriers using frugal
equipment, and collaborate with teachers to begin a new widespread initiative of synthetic biology
curricula in high school classrooms."
10908747,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section 
Down syndrome (DS) is one of the strongest risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), conferring a
20-fold increased risk compared to children without DS. Survival for children with DS-ALL remains 10-20%
lower than that of non-DS-ALL patients, due to both relapse and toxicity. Children with DS also have an
increased risk of several birth defects and chronic health conditions. Although these increased risks have been
known for decades, the basis for the increased risk of leukemia remains unclear, and there is a particular
paucity of studies exploring the interplay between other DS phenotypic features and ALL susceptibility. While
increased dosage of chromosome 21 genes is likely contributory to ALL risk, trisomy 21 alone is not sufficient,
as the lifetime risk of ALL in children with DS is under 2%. We hypothesize that additional genetic modifiers
and other DS-related phenotypes in combination with trisomy 21 influence susceptibility to ALL. We
have made several important observations to date. 1) In the first genome-wide association study of DS-ALL,
we observed that loci in ALL susceptibility genes (e.g., CDKN2A, IKZF1) have stronger effects on ALL risk in
children with DS compared to those without. 2) We have preliminary evidence that children with DS-ALL have
a greater burden of structural birth defects than children with DS without ALL, perhaps suggesting an ALL-
predisposition phenotype with additional syndromic features. These observations suggest unique patterns of
ALL susceptibility in the background of trisomy 21. However, we have not yet systematically evaluated: 1) the
role of structural, rare, and chromosome 21 variants, 2) the association between inherited genetic variation and
somatic genomic abnormalities, or 3) the role of other DS-related phenotypes on leukemia susceptibility and
outcomes. Through the NIH INCLUDE and Kids First mechanisms, we and collaborators have initiated large-
scale genomic sequencing of 2,500 children with DS (~400 with ALL). Capitalizing on this unprecedented
genomic profiling and unique DS cohort, the objectives of the current study are to determine the molecular
underpinnings of ALL in children with DS; and to determine whether DS-related phenotypes are associated
with risk of ALL and/or with outcomes (toxicities, relapse, and survival). To achieve these objectives, the aims
of this study are to 1) perform a comprehensive analysis of heritable variation associated with risk of ALL in
children with DS, with a focus on structural, rare, and chromosome 21 variants; and 2) conduct deep
phenotyping of children with DS-ALL to identify the impact of DS-related phenotypes on leukemia susceptibility
and outcomes. This project will address fundamental questions of why children with DS have an increased risk
of ALL, how their leukemia differs from that of children without DS, and how other DS-related phenotypes may
influence ALL susceptibility, survival, and toxicities. Findings from this study may lead to improved genetic
testing and counseling strategies for children with DS. Insights into genes driving DS-ALL may guide
development of targeted therapies."
10912464,"This is a competing renewal application for a short-term research education program originally funded as a T35
in 2000 and as an R25 in 2010. Our major objective is to continue providing annual short-term research
education experiences for highly motivated students from under-represented backgrounds in order to expose
them to biomedical research in the area of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Locally known as GEMS
(Graduate Experiences for Multicultural Students), over the past 10 years, >138 undergraduate (UG) and 29
health professional students (HPS); >125 supported by the R25 and the rest supported by other programs.
Collectively, these students have published 93 manuscripts; >70% have earned terminal degrees, are working
in science or health-related fields or are still enrolled in school. More than 70% of student participants were
under-represented ethnic minorities. The program builds upon our established infrastructure and uses the
significant strengths of one of the top pulmonary medicine programs in the country. We continue the tradition of
addressing the pipeline by requesting 10 undergraduate and 4 health professional student slots. Here, in addition
to the usual didactic and hands-on research activities, we will use the model of academic “coaches” who are not
intended to supplant the mentor, but rather complement this relationship. Coaches will be past GEMS
participants who are still at Anschutz Medical Campus. Coaches will maintain contact with the students
throughout the year and will guide them through a successful career path. Furthermore, to ensure student
success, we propose to use social science approaches and provide the students with a toolkit that will create an
environment, a community of practice, where they feel safe to talk about personal, academic and professional
issues and to bond through shared norms and values. We will also implement implicit bias workshops and
mentoring best practices for students and mentors. We incorporate a set of targeted questions in the application
that will aid in selection of students highly motivated to pursue biomedical research. We believe that these
approaches will continue the GEMS tradition of excellence in training students from under-represented
backgrounds while at the same time enhancing student’s academic success beyond the summer GEMS
internship."
10911019,"Background: Sepsis, the body’s overwhelming systemic response to infection, strikes more than 1 million
patients annually in the United States and is known to impact over 48,000 Veterans every year. Over the past
decade, sepsis survival has continued to improve through a better understanding of effective therapies, early
intervention, and prophylaxis. This has been seen in the private sector and VA with inpatient mortality
dropping from 15% in 2008 to 10% in 2012. However, despite this improvement, a patient with sepsis may
have up to a 100% increased risk of death at 30 days depending on the hospital to which he/she is admitted in
the VA system.
Significance/Impact: This proposal is specifically designed to address three priority domains of the HSR&D
Service - Healthcare Informatics, Quality and Safety of Health Care, and Virtual Care. Through the unique
combination of these three domains we plan to address two significant limitations in understanding sepsis in
the VA; 1) that existing reports may or may not provide insight into the distinguishing characteristics of the
patients that died with sepsis in what are thought to be similar VA ICUs, and 2) in these reports there are
multiple interventions known or suspected to improve outcomes with varying levels of efficacy about which
little or no information is offered.
Innovation: We can use a novel data source (TeleICU) to directly identify the patient level factors associated
with negative outcomes in the septic patient population, quantify the practices of high and low performing
units, and subsequently improve the care provided to septic patients in VA ICUs using this information.
Specific Aims:
Aim #1: Evaluate risk factors of negative outcomes for specificity to sepsis and within sepsis types to
determine best strategies for adjustment and calculate risk-adjusted ICU mortality rates.
Aim #2: Evaluate the incidence of previously unmonitored elements of sepsis care (hypotension, ventilator
management, and antibiotics) and their impact on outcomes cited in SA1a (ICU mortality as primary
outcome) in VA sepsis patients.
Aim #3: Qualitatively examine the management of hypotension, lung protective ventilation, and antibiotic
therapy in sepsis patients at high and low performing sites (based on appropriately adjusted ICU mortality
rates). Evaluations will include documented protocols, clinical workflows, and TeleICU support.
Methodology: We will conduct a mixed methods investigation by merging data from the TeleICU and
Corporate Data Warehouse to first identify high and low performing ICUs in the treatment of sepsis. We will
then perform an ethnographic investigation of 3 high and low performing ICUs in the treatment of sepsis.
Simultaneously, we will examine the management of hypotension, the use of lung protective ventilation, and
the use and efficacy of antibiotics in septic patients in the ICU.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will develop real-time clinical decision support, to provide local clinicians
with updates on septic patients in the ICU that provide information regarding the state of septic patients and
their compliance with metrics that are associated with improved outcomes. We anticipate this will improve
the overall survival of sepsis patients and potentially reduce the cost of care."
10911045,"Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: Hospitalization and Emergency Department (ED) visits in
community hospitals represent a vulnerable time for Veterans, since dual VA-Community healthcare can be
associated with adverse health outcomes. The rigorous evaluation of VA Office of Community Care (VAOCC)
Acute Hospital Care Coordination Program that we propose will yield valuable formative and summative
information to our operations partner. A systematic program evaluation has the potential to: expand knowledge
of best practices for hospital care transitions, better understand factors associated with program effectiveness,
and enable comparisons of differential impacts among rural vs. urban Veterans.
Background: While current VA access initiatives should have net-positive impacts for Veterans, there may be
negative unintended consequences. To address these concerns, the VAOCC is currently developing a
multicomponent, evidence-based care coordination program to help Veterans receiving acute (ED and
hospital) care at non-VA facilities navigate back to the VA system. Our Ralph H. Johnson VAMC team has
partnered with VAOCC in developing this program, and when implemented nationally, the VAOCC Acute
program will be the first in VA to address cross-system hospital care and the first national rollout in or outside
VA of a post-discharge care coordination intervention.
Objectives
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the implementation of the VAOCC Acute Community Hospital Care Coordination
Program across multiple implementation domains including adoption of key program components, fidelity of
implementation, reach to community partners and eligible Veterans, and maintenance of program activities in 3
VISNs (7, 8, 19). Evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM model collecting formative information using VA
operations data to be shared with VAOCC during program roll-out.
Specific Aim2: Determine overall program effectiveness (summative evaluation) in coordinating care for
Veterans through a) reducing subsequent acute healthcare utilization, b) fidelity to key intervention
components, and c) reducing/neutralizing costs.
H1: Veterans with acute community care events after program implementation will experience lower rates of a)
7-day, 30-day ED revisit, b) 7-day, 30-day hospital readmission, c) fewer total hospital days per episode of
acute illness as compared to Veterans from the pre-implementation period. H2: Facilities implementing
program components with higher measures of fidelity and higher satisfaction with/perception of care transition
quality will demonstrate larger relative improvements in healthcare utilization and as compared to facilities with
lower levels of implementation success. H3: In a formal cost benefit analysis considering program costs and
estimated savings including avoided acute care visits, the program will be deemed budget neutral or cost
saving based on cost-benefit ratios.
Methods. Patient-reported data will be collected using interactive voice response (IVR) and telephone
interviews. Qualitative interviews and questionnaire methods will be used for VA providers. For utilization
outcomes, we will create a research database of merged VA (CDW) and state level all-payer claims data from
3 states (FL, SC, CO). As part of our summative evaluation, we will use a qualitative case study approach in
analyzing qualitative interviews, and we will integrate findings from various data sources."
10920487,"Project Summary
Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) which line the vascular network of the central nervous system
(CNS) in conjunction with perivascular cells form a specialized barrier termed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that
regulates the dynamic traffic of select molecules into and out of the CNS. Studies of BBB dysfunction have been
hampered by an inability to perform direct testing in patients and a lack of in vitro models. Analysis of available
putative BMECs from pluripotent stem cell sources reveals that they do not harbor bona fide brain EC molecular
signatures. Using a transcription factor-based reprogramming strategy, we demonstrate that durable and
functional true endothelial cells with BBB traits may be derived. We will use these verified BMECs in the
development of isogenic BBB/on-a-chip devices. Cortical brain organoids derived from patient specific induced
pluripotent cells (IPSC) will be vascularized by matched IPSC derived bona fide BMECs in a microfluidic device.
To explore the potential of this new technology we will investigate the pathobiology of cerebral malaria a severe
disease syndrome that causes neurodisability in 20% of survivors. Red blood cells infected with the Plasmodium
falciparum parasite adhere to the brain microvasculature causing dysfunction. We hypothesize that the parasite
primes the brain endothelial cells for adherence through their “education” by small extracellular vesicles termed
exosomes. This is an established paradigm in cancer biology in which malignant cells educate metastatic
“microniches” to prime for and enhance tumor survival. The exosomes mediate local and systemic intercellular
communication through the horizontal transfer of information in their proteomes. We recently were able to identify
a critical prognosis biomarker for brain metastasis in breast cancer through studies of exosomal cellular uptake
and proteomic analysis. We will analyze the proteomes of exosomes from children with cerebral malaria and
infuse them into our innovative microfluidic-based BBB model. We will monitor in real time how exosomes trigger
BBB dysfunction and subsequently affect IPS-derived brain organoids from patients affected by CM. These
studies will provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and potentially identify new prognosis biomarkers."
10911001,"Blood vessels affect all aspects of bone physiology, including mineral growth
during new bone formation. To engineer bone as a vascularized tissue we have now
focused on microRNAs as molecular engineering tools because of their ability to
reversibly target multiple regulatory networks. Recent studies from our and other
laboratories have demonstrated that miRNAs promote bone lineage differentiation and
new bone formation through WNT, BMP, and Notch signaling pathways and also control
bone resorption. In our quest for novel therapeutics that promote coupled bone
remodeling and angiogenesis for the treatment of large bone defects we have here
identified the miR-27~23~24 microRNA cluster as a highly promising miRNA candidate
reagent. Our preliminary analysis revealed multiple miR-23 and miR-27 binding sites on
the untranslated region (UTR) of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 and Nlk 3’, which in
conjunction with miR-24 binding sites on the UTR of the angiogenesis inhibitors BIM
and SEMA4A demonstrate the potential of the miR-27-23-24 microRNA cluster for
coupled osteogenic and angiogenic molecular engineering strategies.
 In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that miR-23-27-24 cluster member
expression was greatly reduced in inflammatory tissues. Conversely, miR-27 mimic
treatment of diseased periodontal tissues with severe vertical bone defects resulted in
unexpectedly extensive new bone formation as evidenced by 80% complete restoration
of vertical bone height and new deposition of mineralized tissue in large calvarial bone
defects after 8 weeks of miR-27 application. Implants containing PEG-PLGA-PLL-miR-
27 nanoparticles promoted matrix remodeling, new blood vessel formation, and
substantial amounts of calvarial bone regeneration in critical size defects. On a cellular
level, miR-27 overexpression increased alkaline phosphatase activity and bone marker
gene expression, while inhibition of miR-27 resulted in a dramatic increase in the
expression of osteoclastogenesis related genes and bone resorption. Both miR-24 and
miR-27 promoted endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel tube formation.
Together, these exciting preliminary data prompted us to propose a novel molecular
engineering strategy that will harness the osteogenic and pro-angiogenic qualities of
miR-23/27/24 cluster members in conjunction with suitable scaffolds and re-balance
alveolar and calvarial bone homeostasis for new craniofacial bone formation."
10911004,"This Merit Review application is based on our hypotheses that Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes (FLS) from
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients infected with Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) will have unique gene
expression properties that alter the host immune response to EBV, and that these difference influences the risk
for developing RA. These hypotheses is based on the following observations: All 12 of the FLS cell lines that
we have evaluated, six from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients and six from Osteoarthritis (OA) disease
controls, contained some cells infected with EBV. We discovered that FLS can be superinfected with EBV. We
observed that RA (but not OA) genetic risk loci are enriched for DNA variants that are immunoprecipitated with
Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen-2 (EBNA2) (Relative Risk (RR)=4.5, Bonferroni corrected probability
(Pc)=2.4x10-14). Preliminary data showed differences between RA and OA in the expression of the genes
controlled by elements in RA risk loci. These observations and the 792 publications in Pubmed, often
contradictory, present many intriguing relationships between EBV and RA. In our view these observations are
consistent with EBV being involved in the pathogenesis of RA.
 We plan three initiatives with this DVA Merit Award project. First, we will characterize the virus infection in
FLS (Aim 1) by: assessing the frequency of EBV FLS infection, sequencing the EBV DNA in FLS, and
comparing EBV gene expression in RA, OA, & normal (NL) FLS. We will test the hypothesis that FLS infection
is common among the EBV infected human population. Second, we will explore the FLS response to EBV
infection (Aim 2) by determining host gene expression with RNA-seq to assess EBV infected and secondarily
influenced FLS from RA, OA, & NL subjects and by exploring allele specificity at RA loci in RA, OA, and NL
FLS. Once experimental conditions are determined, single cell RNA-seq will characterize the cell population
infected with EBV and the cells responding to EBV infection. These experiments will evaluate the hypotheses
that RA FLS will have a different gene expression profile than the FLS from OA or NL subjects and that the
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) will distinguish RA from OA and NL FLS. Third, we will assess the
immune response to EBV infected FLS (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that the host response to EBV infection of
the FLS will differentiate RA from OA and NL subjects. In specific, our detailed working hypothesis and current
model is: 1. That usually the OA & NL FLS are abortively infected with EBV, 2. That OA & NL EBV infected
FLS exist at a minimal level, perhaps only expressing a few EBV latent genes, as seen in latently infected B
cells, and 3. That EBV infected OA & NL FLS are usually quiescent to immune recognition. In contrast, in RA
there is evidence that the early steps of the EBV lytic program are initiated with the expression of Early-
Immediate EBV antigens. These changes in combination with other factors (e.g., anti-cyclic citrullinated
peptide autoantibodies, possible microbiome changes, etc.) awaken the quiescent immune response and
result in an overwhelming inflammatory response directed against the EBV infected RA FLS in a way that does
not happen in the OA or NL synovium. As has been our experience in the previous submissions, the results
obtained may contradict any of these ideas leading this work into a new conceptual and strategic direction. On
the other hand, this work has the potential to provide mechanistic details of the currently unknown aspects of
RA pathogenesis, which would become the basis for new therapeutic approaches and preventive strategies.
Whether or not EBV is a component of RA pathogenesis, the studies proposed will provide insight into a
previously unknown tissue specific site of and possible reservoir for a common chronic viral infection that
infects the vast majority of human beings."
10911007,"Abstract
We propose to investigate and validate novel MRI pulse sequences and quantitative measures for mapping
primary brain tumor margins and infiltration. We will focus on glioblastomas (W.H.O. grade IV gliomas (GBM)),
the most prevalent and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. These progressive brain tumors infiltrate into the
brain parenchyma and grow with diffuse margins. However, current clinical imaging modalities fail to reliably
define the extent of glioma infiltration, negatively impacting patient care. Neurosurgeons are faced with uncer-
tainty about what tissue should be removed when planning an optimal resection, and radiation oncologists
must design radiation fields based on an incomplete understanding of the tumor's extent. Therefore, there is an
unmet need for patient-specific, personalized mapping of tumor margins (including what is within the radiologi-
cally defined margin using current state-of-the-art imaging and what is beyond it) in order to improve clinical
treatment of gliomas via methods such as surgery, radiation therapy, or drug delivery. Meeting this unmet need
requires improved imaging of brain and tumor tissue microstructure.
 We recently proposed q-space trajectory imaging (QTI), which goes beyond conventional diffusion MRI
to measure the correlation of water molecule motion between different directions, improving mapping of tissue
and tumor microstructure. Recent work has also demonstrated the potential of quantitative MRI (T2-relaxome-
try) for detecting infiltrative tumor growth in the peritumoral area of gliomas. In fact, the joint distribution of dif-
fusion-relaxation measures can provide important information that is missing in independently acquired T2-re-
laxometry or QTI data alone. In this project, we plan to develop, investigate, and validate rQTI (a novel combi-
nation of T2-relaxometry and QTI) for the critical clinical application of glioma margin and infiltration mapping.
To reach this goal, first we will create a comprehensive and unique diffusion-relaxation (rQTI) and histology
dataset for the study of glioma infiltration and margins. This work will leverage a mouse model in which we will
implant patient-derived xenografts obtained from human GBMs to closely recapitulate key features of human
brain tumors such as microstructure and infiltration. Second, we will develop an optimized clinical acquisition
for computing rQTI-based microstructure measures that are predictive of histology, in under 10 minutes of ac-
quisition time. Third, we will validate rQTI-based microstructure measures against histopathology in 30 patients
with GBM. Patients will be scanned with the optimized rQTI sequence and tissue samples will be obtained us-
ing clinically indicated stereotactic sampling of tissue and/or stereotactic biopsy.
 Overall, the successful outcome of this study has the potential to improve non-invasive mapping of GBM
margins and to reveal infiltration that was previously invisible on imaging. This is expected to provide important
information for GBM treatment planning, with the potential of improving patient survival and quality of life."
10911008,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To strengthen behavioral interventions for improve health, as in cancer prevention and treatment, and
increase their dissemination into clinical practice, what is needed is: (1) more attention to phased T1
translation from basic behavioral and social sciences research to applied behavioral intervention
development; and (2) more focus on early-phase treatment development by promoting the use of new
and innovative methodologies to answer commonly asked questions about basic treatment design. This
skills development course aims to train 100 intervention scientists (Fellows) at any academic rank but
who have an interest in behavioral treatment development to target cancer and related health
behaviors. Training will take place over 6 months including a 3-day workshop followed by bi weekly
webinars with 25 Fellows per session. Learning will be multi-directional and will feature didactic,
interactive, and applied teaching techniques. A train-the-trainer model is integrated throughout the
course. Optional follow-up activities include consultation and mentoring with faculty. The curriculum will
be offered by expert faculty who will teach a phased approach to intervention development, new and
innovative methods that are well-suited to answer common questions that arise during health behavior
treatment development. Among the methodologies are dose-finding methods, mixed methods to
maximize ecological validity of treatments, approaches for small samples, tailoring and adaptive
treatments, and methods to determine the timing and choice of appropriate control groups. The Specific
Aims of the course are: 1) To successfully recruit and train 100 Fellows dedicated to behavioral
interventions relevant for cancer prevention/treatment and related health behaviors over the 4-year
grant period, with substantial minority representation (25 Fellows per year); 2) To increase the skills of
Fellows in a phased approach, with associated innovative methods and designs for T1 translation of
BSSR. 3) To conduct an ongoing evaluation of the success of the skills development course based
upon three basic metrics: (a) perceived value; (b) the reach of the course based upon website hits,
number of applications, and train the trainer activities; and (c) the impact of the course on the career
trajectories of the Fellows (publications, grants). 4) To conduct ongoing curriculum development and
refinement, as well as dissemination via technology, based upon results of quantitative and qualitative
evaluations and new methodologies emerging over the grant period."
10912691,"Reactive chemicals such as chlorine and phosgene pose a grave threat to respiratory health. These agents
were used in warfare, with a significant risk of diversion for terrorist attacks, and frequently cause injuries
due to accidental release. Little progress has been made in developing countermeasures, with supportive
treatment remaining standard of care.
In this application, we hypothesize that inhalation of chlorine and phosgene damage different subsets of
pulmonary cells critical for maintenance of epithelial and endothelial barriers, gas exchange, and tissue
recovery. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary studies in rodent and porcine chlorine exposure models in
which we discovered a novel lung repair mechanism relying on submucosal lung cells that repopulate and
differentiate into new epithelia. In contrast to chlorine, phosgene initially spares upper airway cells and
primarily damages pulmonary endothelial cells, including newly discovered alveolar endothelial cell
subtypes, specialized aerocytes (“aCap”) and general capillary (“gCap”). Comparing mice and pigs, we noted
that the identity and location of cell populations in the pig lung more closely resemble the human anatomy.
The following specific aims are designed to comprehensively analyze the short- and long-term effects of
chlorine and phosgene on lung cell populations in rodents and pigs: Aim 1. Monitor molecular identities and
temporal dynamics of pulmonary cell populations after exposures to chlorine or phosgene and during
recovery; Aim 2. Visualize pulmonary epithelial and alveolar cells and structures after chlorine or phosgene
injury using thick slice microscopy; Aim 3. Compare effects of ventilator and oxygenation support and
positional maneuvers on pulmonary cell survival after phosgene or chlorine exposure"
10912692,"Chromosome double strand breaks (DSBs) that evade DNA damage checkpoints can persist into mitosis.
These DSBs are in danger of forming highly detrimental structures connected to genome shattering and tumor
progression, collectively referred to as micronuclei. To find mechanisms that prevent micronuclei, we discovered
that Drosophila papillar cells naturally inactivate DNA damage checkpoints, and as a result frequently exhibit
DNA fragments in mitosis. These fragments lack centromeres (acentric DNA), yet remarkably segregate during
papillar mitosis. This process prevents micronuclei and tissue development defects. The distinctive dependence
of papillar tissue development on acentric DNA segregation holds promise to reveal fundamental responses to
DSBs that persist into mitosis. From our combination of in vivo genetic screens, live imaging, and complementary
biochemistry approaches with collaborators, we are poised to make unique conceptual advances in this area.
 This proposal leverages our expertise, new findings, and a genetically amenable Drosophila model to
uncover regulation of broken chromosome segregation. The significance of our proposed work is evident in the
frequent contribution of micronuclei to genome instability and the evolutionary conservation of the molecules
studied, including the Alternative End Joining (Alt-EJ) repair protein DNA Polymerase Theta, conserved
monoubiquitination of the DNA repair scaffold FancD2, and the ubiquitin ligase CRL4CDT2. The innovation of our
approach derives from our model system that is evolutionarily wired to solve the challenge of frequent persistent
broken chromosomes, and the enhanced in vivo genetic screening capability of our system. These advantages
led to the preliminary data presented in this proposal. In Aim1, we will define the pathway leading to poleward
segregation of acentric DNA. In this Aim, we will identify Pol Theta domains that function in acentric DNA
segregation, pinpoint the extent to which Alt-EJ occurs in papillar cells with DSBs, and assess the role of FancD2
in regulating Pol Theta after DSBs. In Aim2, we will define the signaling pathway that promotes the transition
from lagging to segregating acentric DNA. In this Aim, we will determine if CRL4CDT2 functions together with Pol
Theta/FancD2 to promote acentric DNA segregation, uncover whether critical regulation of CRL4CDT2 activity or
in papillar cells with DSBs, and assess if inactivity of interphase checkpoints leads to a requirement for CRL4CDT2
in segregating acentric DNA in a non-papillar cell context (wing cells). In Aim 3, we will determine how regulation
of mitotic chromosome condensation contributes to segregation of acentric DNA fragments. We will build on
biochemical, genetic, and protein localization data connecting CRL4CDT2 to the mitotic complex Condensin I. We
will assess the role of CRL4CDT2 in regulating Condensin I localization during acentric DNA segregation and
determine the role of a conserved CRL4CDT2 recognition sequence in Condensin I subunits. Collectively, our
approach will uncover fundamental regulation of broken mitotic DNA and can inform on disease-relevant biology."
10912694,"ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and it most commonly develops
within a carcinogenic cascade from pre-cancerous metaplasia to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Metaplasias
first arise as a response to injury through the chief cell transdifferentiation into spasmolytic polypeptide-
expressing metaplasia (SPEM) cells. While this initial process is possibly reversible, oncogenic gene
activation or chronic inflammation can activate SPEM cell plasticity, which promotes SPEM cell progression to
intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia. This neoplastic process may also lead to transcriptional and
epigenetic changes, and incite cell lineage conversion, where multiple intermediate cell types are produced
that can evolve into cancerous cells, including dysplastic stem cells which may arise during the neoplastic
transition. Furthermore, the oncogenic gene mutation burden may be associated with the cell lineage
conversion and diversification of the dysplastic stem cells to cancerous cells. However, it is not clear whether
the SPEM cell plasticity is responsible for the cell heterogeneity and evolution of pre-cancerous metaplasia to
incomplete IM, which carries a higher risk of patient progression to dysplasia and what mechanisms are
involved in the carcinogenic process. We therefore hypothesize that SPEM cells are key gastric cancer
precursor cells, which display functional properties and cell lineage conversion capacity to drive metaplasia
progression to dysplasia. Our overarching goal is to define mechanisms that control the cell lineage
conversion of reparative SPEM cells towards incomplete IM and more cancerous cell lineages, which display a
higher mutational burden. To address these questions directly, we have established novel in vivo transgenic
mouse models and in vitro metaplastic or dysplastic organoid models derived from transgenic mouse stomachs
following induction of active Kras or from human patient samples with metaplasia or dysplasia. Using these
novel models, we will assess critical SPEM cell lineage derivation and define cell populations that account for
the key transcriptional and epigenetic changes arising during metaplasia progression. We will pursue three
specific aims: First we will assess functional properties of SPEM cells during mucosal recovery or neoplastic
progression following mucosal injury. Second, we will examine regulatory mechanisms of cell lineage
diversification and conversion during metaplasia progression. Third, we will investigate molecular mechanisms
driving cell linage diversification and clonal evolution of dysplastic stem cells to adenocarcinoma. Our studies
will define critical transition points which lead to neoplastic transitions for SPEM cells as the origin of gastric
carcinogenesis. An understanding of regulatory mechanisms in cell plasticity and the ability to reverse such
transitions could lead to therapeutic interventions to prevent gastric cancer."
10913391,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual aggression, which refers to a continuum of sexual activities with a nonconsenting partner from
unwanted sexual contact to forced penetration1, is an intractable public health problem. Despite a substantial
investment in prevention and intervention efforts, rates of sexual aggression perpetration remain high, with 26
– 42% of men self-reporting past perpetration of sexual aggression2. One pathway to sexual aggression
perpetration that has received considerable attention and empirical support is sexual misperception, or the
erroneous perception of a potential partner’s sexual interest or consent3-6. Sexual misperception shares
several key risk factors with sexual aggression perpetration, making it a valuable intermediary mechanism for
examining perpetration constructs. Specifically, both sexual misperception and sexual aggression perpetration
are associated with alcohol intoxication6-12 and a constellation of attitudes collectively referred to as the
Confluence Model4,5,13-18. Although evidence suggests acute intoxication and Confluence Model constructs
interact to predict sexual misperception, the nature of this interaction is unclear and the underlying
mechanisms remain unexamined. This proposal aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of
alcohol and Confluence Model constructs on sexual misperception and directly assess this interaction through
an alcohol myopia (AM) framework. AM theory posits that alcohol’s effects on behavior are driven by its ability
to direct attention to impelling (“go”) cues and away from inhibiting (“stop”) cues19. Attention to these cues is
also influenced by a priori knowledge structures20-22 such as those encapsulated in the Confluence Model and
those activated by the environment. The proposed research will directly measure the impact of Confluence
Model constructs on intoxicated men’s attention to impelling and inhibiting cues of sexual interest and the
effects of attention to these cues on sexual misperception in a field setting. Conducting this research at
drinking venues addresses several significant gaps in the literature, namely the generalizability of these
processes and the effects of contextual cues, which have substantial potential to inform intervention design
and evaluation. This proposal is commensurate with the candidate’s desire to develop a research program
centered around understanding the mechanisms underpinning alcohol-involved sexual misperception and
sexual aggression perpetration. Through the proposed research and training plan, the applicant will develop
the skills and expertise needed to make a substantive contribution to alcohol and sexual aggression research
as an independent clinical scientist."
10913314,"Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive joint disease leading to cartilage damage, pain and loss of
function. While many stem cell therapies for OA are under investigation, none are currently FDA-approved for
modifying the course of the disease. Of the many adult stem cell types potentially applicable to OA, bone marrow
stem cells (BMSCs) from bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) are the most clinically translatable (and are
already in clinical use) since they can be harvested using minimally invasive technology and do not require in
vitro expansion. There is, however, significant potential for improving efficacy of BMSC treatment for OA. The
number of senescent cells in BMC increases with age and OA, and these cells release pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines, proteases, and other senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) that can
impair stem cell function and likely contribute to OA development/progression. Dr. Kirkland’s laboratory (co-
investigator) has identified compounds that specifically kill senescent cells, abrogating systemic SASP factors.
We have shown that these senolytic agents can delay OA in a preclinical model. We have also shown that
blocking fibrosis with Losartan (a TGF-β1blocker) can improve cartilage repair by promoting regeneration of
hyaline cartilage while reducing the amount of fibrocartilage. Thus, we hypothesize that administration of
senolytic and/or anti-fibrotic agents will enhance the beneficial effect of BMSCs for treating OA. We propose to
perform, a randomized clinical trial at The Steadman Clinic (TSC) and Steadman Philippon Research Institute
(SPRI). This phase I/II trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fisetin (a senolytic dietary supplement) and
Losartan (an anti-fibrotic drug), used either individually or in combination, for improving the clinical efficacy of
BMSCs in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The senolytic (Fisetin 1000mg/day, previously FDA IND
approved) regimen will be cycles of 2 days on/28 days off, administered before and 3 months after BMSC
treatment. The anti-fibrotic (Losartan, 25mg/day, previously IND-exempted) will be administered for 30 days
starting immediately after BMSC treatment. OA knee joints will undergo MRI at baseline and 18 months post-
treatment to assess changes in cartilage morphology and structure over time. Patient-reported outcomes for
pain and function will be collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12 & 18 months. Joint and cartilage function will be
assessed using video-motion analysis at baseline and 18 months. OA biomarkers related to cartilage
degeneration, inflammation and pain will be assessed at baseline and 18 months. Blood and synovial fluid will
be evaluated at baseline, 4 days and 18 months after treatment to assess changes in cellular senescence and
OA biomarkers. This trial will build upon a currently active clinical trial on orthobiologics for OA treatment at
SPRI (utilizing the same patient population and outcomes assessments), demonstrating the ability of our teams
to perform the proposed study and also leveraging the combined trials to effectively provide a 6-arm,
comprehensive assessment of biological therapies for improving treatment of OA."

Recovery of Adolescent Alcohol Disruption of Basal Forebrain-Cortical Projection Circuits
Project Summary
Heavy alcohol consumption during adolescence is associated with persistent changes in brain structure,
connectivity, and adult cortical-mediated cognitive function. Critical pathological changes consistently observed
in rodent models of adolescent binge ethanol exposure (Adolescent Intermittent Ethanol; AIE) are a reduction
of cortical nerve growth factor (NGF), suppression of the cholinergic phenotypes, and a long-term decrease in
the number of functional cholinergic basal forebrain neurons (CBFNs). The cholinergic projection neurons
within the nucleus basalis magnocellularis complex (NbM) provide acetylcholine (ACh) to the frontal cortex,
including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Behaviorally-stimulated efflux of
ACh in both the mPFC and OFC are blunted following AIE, and there is a loss of cognitive and behavioral
flexibility. Our recent data demonstrate that AIE-induced loss of CBFNs is due to epigenetic silencing of
cholinergic phenotypic markers, but exercise, potentially through a NGF mechanism, can reverse these
epigenetic changes and rescue cholinergic neurons. This demonstrates that AIE is initially marked by a
reduction of the expression of cholinergic neuronal phenotypes, rather than neuronal cell death. Thus,
mechanisms should be explored to recover CFBN pathology following AIE. Our overarching hypothesis is that
AIE-induced reductions of NGF in cortical projection sites leads to epigenetic silencing of cholinergic
phenotypes with the NbM, retraction and/or dysfunctional re-innervation of the cortical-NbM cholinergic
connectome, causing blunting of cortical cholinergic tone and cognitive dysfunction. However, appropriately
timed NGF-based therapies (exercise, NGF gene therapy, CRISPR/dCas9-P300 editing) following AIE will
reinvigorate cholinergic forebrain circuitry through the revitalization of cholinergic genes, which will rescue
cortical ACh and recover AIE-induced impairments in cortical-dependent behaviors. Our goals are to map and
rescue cholinergic forebrain and cortical circuit pathology seen following AIE (Aim 1), restore cognitive
functioning by exercise, NGF-gene therapy, or selective chemogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons (Aim
2), and identify the central role of NGF deficits, through CRISPR/dCas9 editing, in AIE-induced epigenetic
silencing of cholinergic phenotype genes (Aim 3). Mounting evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of
NGF as a course to rescue vulnerable CBFNs undergoing neurodegeneration, and we have strong evidence
that AIE-induced cholinergic pathology can be reversed. Understanding the mechanisms of cholinergic
neuronal recovery will aid in the development of more effective therapies to treat cognitive dysfunction
associated with alcohol-related brain damage and other neurodegenerative disorders."

10914305,"AIHEC BIRCH Overall Core
Project/Narrative
The vision of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium’s (AIHEC) “Building Indigenous Research
Capacity in Health” (BIRCH) project is sovereign Tribal Nations asserting full ownership, direction, and control
of the health research needed to help their people grow healthy and strong. Implementing new programs in the
37 TCUs across the country, AIHEC will provide additional resources for American Indian and Alaska Native
(AIAN) students to pursue coursework and careers that will enable them to act as healthcare providers and
researchers. This project provides a comprehensive approach to growing a networked community of AIAN and
non-Native researchers, educators, and community practitioners to implement traditional knowledge practices
in addressing AIAN health issues and continuously improve Native health and health research practices and
outcomes.
The lack of tribal healthcare researchers and providers perpetuates health disparities and a lack of equity in
tribal communities. Furthermore, studies show that communities with tribal healthcare providers and
researchers have a higher treatment adherence and fewer mortalities or serious illnesses. Promoting the
advancement of AIAN students will not only benefit the students. Still, it will also lead to healthier tribal
communities, increased compliance with healthcare visits and interventions, participation in clinical trials, and a
reduction in the primary causes of illness and mortality such as diabetes, substance use disorders, injuries,
homicide, and suicide.
The long-term goals of the project are: To expand a community of Indigenous research practice in
health/health sciences at the nation’s TCUs; to establish TCUs as essential tribally-centered components of the
national health sciences research and education infrastructure; to improve the quality of health services
provided to AIANs using a science-based empirical approach to intervention development and evaluation that
is relevant to Native peoples and communities and based on core tribal values, cultures, and traditions; to
expand the TCU component of the health research and education career pipeline to recruit, support, and
provide critical linkages for AIAN students to pursue health careers; to empower tribes and tribal communities
to develop and control their research agenda and connect that research to tribal values and needs, and to
promote the integration of Indigenous knowledge and Western knowledge."

Despite significant progress in research, practice, and policy over the past few decades, many children and
youth continue to experience poor mental health outcomes based on their socioeconomic disadvantage, ethnic
or racial minority status, or immigrant status. African American and Latino youth have 1.5–3 times greater odds
of experiencing an unmet mental health need than do their white counterparts and are more likely to be
negatively impacted by social determinants of mental health related to poverty. With their unrivaled ability to
reach youth, school-based and pediatric primary care services are ideal hubs to provide mental health,
healthcare, social services, and prevention to students and families who otherwise face barriers to care. Using
Participatory Design and Community Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR), UCLA and UCSF
psychiatry research centers with Los Angeles Trust for Children’s Health and San Francisco Health Network
propose to: (1) Fully co-design (with youth, caregivers, clinicians and other stakeholders) an innovative mental
health digital tool, called 4Youth, to implement algorithmically supported mental health and social determinants
screening and triage, resiliency apps and navigation activities AND help support the primary care-clinical
workforce within school centers and pediatric services; (2) Study the implementation of two mental health
navigation models separately (family navigaton+4Youth and youth navigation+4Youth), and their combined
effectiveness for improving connecting and matching youth to the right level of care and supports. This project
will be initiated with youth 11-24 years old and family and community members across 10 Los Angeles Unified
School District (LAUSD) Wellness Centers and 10 San Francisco Health Network pediatric primary care
centers, which serve mostly Black, Latino, and Asian children. Mobile technology approaches are gaining
empirical support and hold great potential for enhancing mental health navigator models. Incorporating
scalable digital health tools, and statistically evaluated algorithms to aid the navigation process, such as
screening, triage, tracking, connecting to care, and multi-level communication, will help ensure youth are
receiving optimal care that navigators, providers and other relevant systems can measure. A successful
outcome of the project is a CPPR developed open-source intervention implementable in school-based and
pediatric primary care services, for improving mental health services access for minoritized youth."

 Sleep disturbances are a common facet of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affecting 20-40% of
patients in the mild to moderate stage of the illness. There is strong evidence that poor sleep
accelerates the progress of AD through the failure to clear brian toxins during sleep. Research
has shown that promoting healthy sleep, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), reversed the
accelerating impacts of disrupted sleep in AD patients and reduced their annual increases in AD
biomarkers, reduced cognitive decline, stabilized depressive symptoms, and improved
psychopathological behavior. There is increasing evidence that promoting sleep, specifically
healthy sleep architecture, reduces the risk of poor sleep accelerating AD. However, there are
currently no approved therapies that are specifically designed to promote sleep and healthy
sleep architecture in AD patients and patients at high risk for AD. Thus, there is a significant
unmet clinical need to develop a sleep promoting device that is well tolerated by pre-AD and
early-stage AD patients.
 Our innovation is a device that promotes sleep onset, sleep duration, and the ideal sleep
stage architecture including SWS, to prevent the disease accelerating impacts of disrupted
sleep on AD patients. The goal of this Phase I project is to create a testable prototype that can
sense sleep architecture and provide peripheral neuromodulation stimulation to individuals over
the age of 65, a group with an elevated risk of AD. Successful completion of this Phase I effort
will position us to demonstrate in clinical studies that our device improves SWS in early-stage
AD patients and reduces AD biomarkers. Our final commercialized device will be a comfortable
low-profile medical device that promotes healthy sleep in high-risk and early-stage AD patients
and reverses the accelerating effects of disrupted sleep for millions of AD patients."

HIV-associated comorbidities, co-infections, and complications (CCCs) can exacerbate the health burden in
people living with HIV (PLWH). Using innovative cell culture and in vivo systems, this application focuses on
HIV-related pathogenesis in the liver and the establishment of a new area of HIV research that combines studies
of the circadian rhythm in the context of HIV/HBV co-infections and other liver-related diseases such as fatty
liver disease. Understanding the unique biological and metabolic processes that take place in PLWH with HIV-
related CCCs may lead to highly impactful research findings and treatments. The main hypothesis of this
proposal is that disruption of circadian clock genes, pathways, and functions may impact HIV-related CCCs.
Disruption of circadian rhythm can alter the susceptibility to gut permeability to HIV and can further lead to
complications in the liver. In addition, viral hepatitis, and specifically chronic HBV infection in PLWH poses a
serious health burden as it accelerates the progression to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer with mechanisms that
are still not well understood. Moreover, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease which is
impacted by circadian metabolic genes and pathways with detrimental consequences for liver pathogenesis in
PLWH. Finally, drug metabolism takes place in the liver and metabolism of HIV antivirals is dependent on
circadian regulation. The proposed studies will use state-of-the art technologies and physiologically-relevant cell
culture and in vivo systems under normal or abnormal circadian conditions for HIV/HBV co-infection and fatty
liver studies with the premise to yield highly impactful findings in HIV-related pathogenesis in the liver."
10908578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane bound nanoparticles that can interact with other cells
as a means of cell:cell communication. Emerging data suggest that β cell-derived exosomes, an
EV subtype released by exocytosis of multivesicular bodies, may act as paracrine effectors in
islet health. Given the potential for exosomes to play a role in β cell communication with
surrounding cells in the islet microenvironment, a critical need exists for deliberate research
defining mechanisms of β cell exosome biology under physiologic and pathophysiologic
circumstances. β cell expression of the transmembrane immune checkpoint protein death-ligand
1 (PD-L1) plays a key role to support β cell survival in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Preliminary data
suggest that β cell exosome membranes carry PD-L1, and that exosomal PD-L1 is upregulated
by cytokine treatment of parent β cells. Our central hypothesis is that stressed β cells in the T1D
microenvironment alter their exosomal contents to include protective mechanisms aimed at
evading β cell destruction associated with autoimmunity. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanistic
etiology of altered β cell exosome PD-L1 cargo. We hypothesize that proinflammatory interferon
signaling activates molecular regulators of intracellular β cell PD-L1 that, in concert with
mediators of exosome biogenesis, increase total exosomal PD-L1. Chemical and genetic
manipulation will be used to test impacts of these pathways on β cell exosomal PD-L1. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that via transfer to or interaction with surrounding β cells and T cells, β
cell exosomal PD-L1 loading is a protective mechanism shielding β cells from autoimmune
destruction. Use of β cells differentiated from a human induced pluripotent stem cell line
overexpressing GFP-tagged PD-L1 will allow for direct tracking of PD-L1 transfer and binding to
other β cells and CD8+ T cells. Aim 3 will employ a novel microfluidic device to test the
hypothesis that PD-L1+ exosome release will be increased in humans with or at risk for T1D.
We will quantify differences in total and islet-derived EV PD-L1 in human plasma or pancreas
slice media and compare to nondiabetic controls. Testing will also be performed in plasma from
individuals with longstanding T1D with or without residual detectable C-peptide to determine if
plasma islet-derived EV PD-L1 is linked to functional β cell survival. This work will lead to a
paradigm shift in the field’s understanding of β cell communication with surrounding cells, and
determine the clinical potential of islet-derived PD-L1 exosome cargo as a therapeutic targeting
β cell survival or a biomarker to dissect T1D disease-related heterogeneity."

In this new application we propose a unique training experience that builds upon Vanderbilt
University's (VU) extraordinary record of research, training, and fostering diversity in biomedical
science and that seeks to create a new paradigm promoting the pathway to biomedical science
careers and aspirational life choices for a cadre of underrepresented, postbaccalaureate scholars.
This program provides an intellectually, socially and culturally rewarding experience to engage
scholars at multiple levels throughout a 12 month training program. We will leverage VU's training
expertise to cultivate knowledge and research skills and provide an integrated training program
that supports resilience by fostering connections among program participants and their research
mentors, peers, and respective communities. A strong multiple-PI leadership team is composed
of senior individuals with overlapping expertise in scientific research, mentoring, inclusion, skill
development, trainee engagement, and fostering a community of diverse scholars. This team is
supported by internal and external board members with demonstrated commitment to training and
diversity. We will provide a research intensive immersion for carefully-selected scholars each
year. Our pool of distinguished mentors have a diversity of research interests that are aligned with
the mission of NIGMS. In addition to an intense, mentored research experience, we will offer
unique perspectives and resources, provide a productive framework to fully understand
the promise and process of scientific discovery, and foster invaluable connections among
scholars and their mentors and communities. We posit that scholars, most especially those
from underrepresented groups, must also be trained in how to relate their work to the larger
community. They must be aware and knowledgeable of the forces shaping the public's
perception of science and how to shape the scientific narrative in both underrepresented and
majority communities. Our overall goal is ambitious and innovative; we seek to create scholars
that will become the integrators needed to connect science with communities through their
academic credentials, ability to build and retain trust, and cultural competence skills. We
will fulfill this vision through: an intensive research and training immersion experience, with
mentoring as a central component; regular opportunities to interact with their peers and acquire
the core values of collaboration, teamwork and personal enrichment; and exposure to the public
awareness of science, education, policy and social change. Together, we will thus provide an
exciting and comprehensive experience to minority scholars poised to make career-defining, life-
changing decisions with future implications for the scientific enterprise across the nation."
10908582,"The major barrier to long term survival following lung transplantation is a progressive loss of lung function,
termed chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), for which constrictive fibrosis in small airways is a pathologic
hallmark. CLAD affects over half of lung transplant recipients by 4 years post-transplant and negates much of
the quality of life and functional improvements associated with transplantation. Pitt, Toronto, and UCSF Lung
Transplant programs have refined transcriptional analysis of small airway brushings from lung transplant
recipients as a novel technique to understand the gene expression changes at the anatomical site where CLAD
pathology develops. We have published gene expression changes associated with CLAD validated across our
centers. This proposal leverages this innovative approach to understand mechanisms of CLAD pathogenesis.
Our preliminary data show an early upregulation of hypoxia pathways in airway brushings including genes that
recruit and activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes using both airway epithelial cell culture in hypoxic conditions and
pathway analysis of airway brush transcriptomes. This hypoxia signaling may reflect disordered
microvasculature, absent bronchial circulation, and vascular inflammation associated with lung transplant. In
recruited T lymphocytes, we also observed upregulation of tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) genes,
which are major drivers of apoptosis in lymphocyte targets. Our data show preferential apoptosis in airway club
cells, the protectors and progenitors of small airways, in association with upregulated TNF-related apoptosis-
inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression. Our single cell investigations in airway brushings and bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid show the segregation of these pathways across epithelial and lymphoid cell types. Based on
these data, we hypothesize that airway hypoxia precedes TNFSF gene expression and T cell-mediated airway
club cell apoptosis that drive CLAD pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will generate parallel cohorts
investigating bulk and single cell transcriptomes of CLAD versus controls across three centers, allowing for
rigorous cross-validation of gene expression signatures. We will complement these studies with cell culture-
based methods to determine mechanisms driving these gene expression changes. In Aim 1, we will quantify
hypoxia-related transcripts in airway brush cells with respect to CLAD and determine how hypoxia can promote
lymphocytic inflammation. In Aim 2, we will determine the cellular sources and kinetics of TNFSF co-stimulatory
molecule expression in CLAD using airway brushes and BAL fluid. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether TRAIL
preferentially induces club cell apoptosis. The synergy of three large lung-transplant translational research
programs with world-class cross-institutional biostatistical infrastructures provides a unique opportunity to
address this hypothesis rigorously. The cell-specific gene expression signatures over the time course of CLAD
development that will be generated through this study are critically needed as surrogate biomarkers to support
clinical trials of targeted therapies and to pioneer a novel approach to CLAD diagnosis."

The Congress of the International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) is the premier
international scientific meeting devoted to alcohol research. Alcohol use and misuse is the leading risk factor
for attributable burden of disease among people ages 25 to 49 and the 7th highest risk factor for premature
death and disability worldwide. Given the immense global public health and personal cost of alcohol misuse
and use disorders, it is critical to have a venue for scientific exchange among international researchers to
address important research questions that inform public health policies, prevention and treatment strategies.
The ISBRA Congress brings together an international cadre of alcohol researchers that study the biomedical,
psychosocial, and clinical aspects of alcohol use, misuse and addiction. During this Congress, basic and
clinical scientists provide updates on scientific findings, exchange ideas, discuss and debate issues in the field,
and form scientific collaborations. This scientific exchange is invaluable for both established and developing
research programs around the world. The ISBRA Congress location is rotated among the Americas, Europe,
and Asia/Australia. The 2024 ISBRA Congress will be held on September 23-26 in Melbourne, Australia as a
joint meeting with Asia-Pacific Society for Alcohol and Addiction Research (APSAAR); the 2025 Congress will
be held in June 21-25 as a joint meeting with the Research Society on Alcohol (RSA) in New Orleans, LA,
USA. Subsequent meeting locations will rotate among Europe, Asia and then the Americas, the destination
determined by the ISBRA Board. This application would provide partial travel support for scientists to attend
these important Congresses. Funding support is prioritized to ensure that trainees, early-stage career
investigators, and scientists who would otherwise not be able to attend can participate in the conference, to
foster the growth of young and diverse scientists that will develop into the leaders of the alcohol research field."

on a population-based sample of children by personnel certified in trachoma grading. The WHO's successful
trachoma elimination campaign has created a situation in which some areas have too many to trachoma cases
to declare elimination but too few trachoma cases to certify trachoma graders. Adopting smartphone-based
trachoma telemedicine addresses this issue by allowing workers with little clinical experience to perform

for trachoma surveys, Tropical Data, does not currently support ocular photography. We propose here to
integrate smartphone photography with Tropical Data and add functionality that will transform it into a more
user-friendly, open access suite of smartphone-based survey modules. This would enhance flexibility and
facilitate broader health surveys that can be used to better target limited health resources.
This first part of the study aims to develop and refine the hardware and software necessary to integrate
smartphone conjunctival photography into the Tropical Data platform, and to assess the feasibility of the
resulting product in remote community-based settings in Peru. First, modules for photography, visual acuity
assessment, autorefraction, sample collection, and user-defined questionnaires will be added to the existing
Tropical Data application. Second, the impact of varying smartphone models and/or ambient lighting will be
assessed for each module. Third, the updated mobile application will be tested in a small number of villages to
determine the feasibility of testing multiple modules per child.
The second part of the study validates the components of the smartphone-based system when used in three
different field locations in Peru (e.g., jungle, mountains, desert). We will examine the sensitivity and specificity
of smartphone photography relative to certified human graders, smartphone visual acuity relative to standard
ETDRS visual acuity, and autorefraction relative to human refraction, and hypothesize that these metrics will
be superior to pre-defined minimally acceptable criteria.
The UCSF Proctor Foundation and Cayetano University in Peru will collaborate to achieve these goals. We
will work in close cooperation with the WHO and Tropical Data, who will be actively engaged in this research
throughout development and testing. This research has great potential for wide dissemination and positive
impact on health."
10919239,"Hyperglycemia in pregnancy has numerous well-established complications including fetal overgrowth and its
attendant risks of cesarean delivery, birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and childhood
obesity, among others. Available evidence suggests that the development of these sequelae begins in early
pregnancy, months prior to conventional diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus. Despite this, there are no
widely accepted diagnostic criteria for hyperglycemia in early pregnancy. This is due, in part, to major limitations
of the tools employed for glycemic measurements in pregnancy; pregnant women have not yet fully benefitted
from advances accrued over the past four decades in glycemic assessment using continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) and glycated markers (such as hemoglobin A1c). Accurate assessments of glycemia using these tools
would allow not only for the investigation of the relationship between early pregnancy glycemia and adverse
outcomes, but also for the identification of extra-glycemic factors that modulate the risk of these outcomes in
women with early pregnancy hyperglycemia. We propose to use our established infrastructure for recruitment of
ethnically-diverse pregnant women in the first trimester to conduct a longitudinal observational cohort study of
glycemia in pregnancy at two sites in Boston, Massachusetts (5000 deliveries/year combined) as part of a multi-
center Consortium in collaboration with the NIDDK. Our team of investigators, expert in gestational glucose
metabolism, glycated protein assays, CGM, and perinatal genomics, brings decades of experience collaborating
in multicenter studies with highly successful recruitment and long-term retention. Among pregnant participants
without pre-existing diabetes enrolled in the first trimester, we will perform serial glycemic assessment using oral
glucose tolerance tests, CGM, and glycated markers across gestation. We will follow participants through
delivery to ascertain maternal and neonatal outcomes. In Aim 1 we will use CGM to define hyperglycemia in
early pregnancy based on association with large for gestational age birth weight and other hyperglycemia-
associated adverse outcomes. In Aim 2 we will identify an optimal glycated marker, measurable on a non-fasting
blood sample, to assess glycemia in early pregnancy and across gestation. In Aim 3 we will test key extra-
glycemic factors (maternal insulin resistance and common fetal genetic variation) as effect modifiers of the
relationship between maternal glycemia and adverse outcomes. These investigations will establish a new
standard of care for diagnosis of early pregnancy hyperglycemia, simplify clinical measurement of glycemia in
pregnancy, and bring advances in precision diabetes care to the obstetric population."
10918303,"Genetic ablations of rod and cone transducin alpha subunits in the so-called KK mice do not silent the outer retina as we
have found that inner retinal neurons still robustly respond to light. This surprised transducin-independent light
sensitivity does not depend on melanopsin signaling in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. This so-named
“transducin- and melanopsin-independent phototransduction (TMIP)” embodied in the 3K mice apparently works
through an unknown and potentially novel signaling mechanism in retina. We have shown that TMIP-generated light
signal passes through retinal circuit and is capable of driving retinal ganglion cells to confer image-forming vision. We
hypothesize that TMIP occurs in developing and mature rod and/or cone photoreceptors, mediated by visual pigment
and trimeric G-proteins, and indispensable for normal postnatal retinal development. In Aim-1 we will study the cellular
origin of TMIP to determining relative contributions of rod and/or cone as candidate venue where TMIP takes place. In
Aim-2 we will test the involvement of known visual pigments in TMIP, as well as trimeric G-proteins and other candidate
signaling molecules/pathways. Aim-3 is to fully characterize TMIP’s role in light-dependent postnatal retinal
development at times when transducin-dependent conventional phototransduction is yet to emerge. This application
contains novel findings, conceptual, material and methodological innovations. Significance lies in the advancement of
the phototransduction and retinal development fields, with clinical relevance in explaining mysteries concerning
incomplete human achromatopsia involving Gnat2 and Cnga3 mutations."

 Depressive and anxiety (referred to internalizing) disorders are increasing in prevalence in adolescents; yet,
no specific etiology has been clearly demonstrated. This is quite concerning given that these disorders are
associated with substantial distress and impairment, jeopardize one's trajectory towards a productive adulthood,
and increase suicide risk; the latter being the 2nd leading cause of death in adolescents, with worsening recent
trends. Iron deficiency (ID) has been associated with neuropsychiatric impairment, including depressive and
anxiety symptoms. This is not surprising, given iron's role in dendritic mitochondrial motility during hippocampal
neuron development, monoaminergic signaling, and myelination. In fact, across two independent samples of
medically-healthy adolescents, we have found prevalent ID and an inverse association between iron stores and
the severity of internalizing symptoms. Moreover, our preliminary evidence suggests that body iron stores are
associated with brain morphometry and connectivity, as captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Building on these novel findings, the current research application seeks to enroll unmedicated 10 to 17 year-
old participants with and without internalizing disorders to examine the association between peripheral iron
stores, as captured by serum ferritin, and brain iron content, as measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping
(QSM), a state-of-the-art MRI-based technique (Aim 1). Moreover, in order to establish the impact of ID on brain
development, we will examine the association between brain and body iron stores, on the one hand, and brain
structure, brain connectivity, and white matter integrity, on the other (Aim 2). Finally, in order to establish the
clinical significance of the findings, we will examine the association between brain and body iron stores and
psychiatric symptom severity (Aim 3).
 The proposed work will be the first to investigate the effect of ID on brain development and clinical symptoms
in late childhood and adolescence, a developmental period characterized by increased risk for ID as well as
rapid brain structural and functional changes. The ultimate goal is to determine the clinical significance of ID, in
the absence of anemia, informing future therapeutic interventions."

and mortality. This renewal application for a highly successful interdisciplinary pre-doctoral training program
offers coordinated mentorship, didactic training, career development activities, and supervised research
experiences to prepare PhD students for careers as independent investigators. The established pre-doctoral
program will build on two successful funding cycles and complements and interfaces with our existing NIH-
funded T32 program for post-doctoral training in obesity research. Students entering their 2nd year of PhD
training enroll in a formal integrated program tailored to individual interests. Trainees participate in the
investigative programs of UAB’s NIH-funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center, one of only 12 such centers
nation-wide. Each trainee has an individual mentoring team consisting of a primary mentor and two co-mentors
with one mentor from each of three major disciplinary domains (Biomedical; Behavioral/Social;
Quantitative/Physical). The faculty's disciplinary diversity (nutritionists, exercise scientists, physicians,
psychologists, statisticians, physiologists, geneticists, epidemiologists, etc.) and strong collaborative ties
facilitates multidisciplinary training. Students from any UAB department may apply to this program, but must
have a mentoring team from this T32 program’s approved faculty. All students, regardless of their departmental
affiliation, participate in all activities and coursework for this T32 program. Individuals are recruited from the large
pool of eligible 1st year PhD students on campus and selected via formal application and committee review,
based on graduate school performance, faculty recommendations, and consideration of the degree to which their
interests fit with those of the faculty and ongoing research programs. All trainees must have as a future plan an
investigative career in obesity-related research. The program promotes an approach to investigation that is
scientifically and ethically rigorous. Regular reviews of individual trainees with the program directors ensure that
adequate progress toward an independent research career is made. We have shown great success in attracting
talented trainees and guiding them toward careers as independent scientists. Our program is currently funded
for 12 trainee slots and we request continued support at this level."

10914875,"Enhancing blood Donation at Schools and Beyond: An implementation Science study
Project Summary
Over the past decade, Malawi has made substantial progress in improving critical health
measures including reducing infant, under-5 years mortality, maternal mortality rate, and HIV
associated deaths. Despite this progress, preventable deaths from malaria-associated anemia
and obstetric hemorrhage still occur due to blood shortage in the country. Over the last 15 years,
the Malawi Blood Transfusion Services (MBTS) has dramatically increased its capacity for blood
collection and distribution, but the goal of 100% collection by MBTS has not been achieved and
there remains a 27% deficit of the nation’s need. Current MBTS program data suggest secondary
student donations programs yield the highest uptake of blood donations but many of these student
donors are not retained long term, particularly after graduation. As regular donors provide the
lowest risk of transmitted transfusion infections, identifying effective strategies for increasing
regular donors is critical in ensuring sustainable supply of safe blood.
The application’s emphasis is on identifying sustainable and efficient donor recruitment and
retention strategies that would increase safe blood donations in Malawi, taking advantage of the
apparent enthusiasm of youth to donate blood and their relatively low risk of transmitted
transfusion infections. Specifically, three aims will be implemented: Phase 1 (UG3), Aim 1:
Conduct spatial, epidemiological and Hemovigilance analysis of existing MBTS and Ministry
of Health (MOH) data from current blood collections systems to identify optimal functioning
districts for replication, data quality improvement and potential inclusion for implementation
science trial; Aim 2: Conduct evaluation of facilitators and barriers to blood collection and
repeat donations according to high and low performing districts/programs/schools in order to
inform and refine implementation science strategy; and Phase 2 (UH3), Aim 3: Determine the
effectiveness of an enhanced Malawian-tailored school-based donation club program to
promote first time donation and engage donor retention post-secondary school. Informed by a
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we expect this proposed trial will yield
culturally sensitive, age appropriate incentive programs, donor messaging and communication
strategies to maximize enthusiasm for donation.
The consortium brings together a multi-disciplinary research team with expertise in blood
transfusion medicine, epidemiology, behavioral science, implementation science and familiarity
with the Malawian culture and context to achieve the objectives. Implementation science capacity
building for young Malawian investigators is embedded within the grant’s activities to ensure
continued research in blood transfusion medicine long term."
10914876,"ABSTRACT
The burden of gastric cancer falls disproportionately on racial/ethnic minorities in the US, with incidence rates among
Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics two- to three-fold higher than that among non-Hispanic whites. Further, individuals who self-
identify as belonging to any of these three groups are also more likely to die from gastric cancer, and comparing Black
men to White men, specifically, this mortality disparity is greater than that for all other cancers. In the US, gastric cancer
has a particularly low survival rate (32% at 5-years) as it is generally asymptomatic until late-stage, when treatment is no
longer effective. Each year in the US, 26,000 people are diagnosed with gastric cancer, and over 10,000 people die of the
disease. Moreover, the racial disparity in gastric cancer continues to grow over time. And yet, the underlying reasons for
this racial disparity in gastric cancer incidence in the US are substantially understudied. The predominant cause of gastric
cancer is infection with the common bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori is more prevalent among people
of color than non-Hispanic whites, and, in fact, H. pylori is the world’s single leading carcinogenic infectious agent,
responsible for an estimated 36.9% of the over 2.2 million infection-associated cancers diagnosed in 2018, more even
than those attributed to human papillomavirus (31.5%), or the Hepatitis B and C viruses combined (23.5%). Currently,
however, little is known about whether the disparity in gastric cancer is a result of differences in H. pylori prevalence, host
response to H. pylori, or differences in other risk factors that might affect the development of gastric cancer. These
potential other risk factors include key individual and neighborhood characteristics that differ greatly by race, such as
household crowding and residential segregation, which could increase the risk of H. pylori infection, contribute to chronic
stress, and induce a more severe immune response. Our goal is to fill the gap in knowledge of risk factors for H. pylori-
associated gastric cancer to provide the understanding of the underlying factors that indicate who is at high risk of gastric
cancer in the US. To do this, we will build a nested case-control study of approximately 800 non-cardia gastric cancer cases
and 2:1 matched controls, utilizing prospective cohort data from a diverse population in the US (67% non-white) from 4
NCI-funded cohorts with pre-diagnostic specimens available: Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC); Prostate, Lung, Colorectal,
and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO); Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS); and Women’s Health Initiative
(WHI). We will assay these biospecimens for antibody levels to H. pylori-specific proteins and for pepsinogen (a validated
marker of gastric atrophy), thoroughly assess individual and neighborhood factors that are associated with gastric cancer
risk, and determine what drives the differences in race by H. pylori antibody levels and atrophy and resulting gastric cancer
risk. Finally, we will develop an integrated “cells to society” modeling framework to assess the impact of social
determinants of health on the patterns of H. pylori antibody levels, gastric atrophy and resulting disparities in gastric
cancer. Ultimately, these findings will provide the information needed to allow for targeting of high-risk patients for the
clinical trials necessary to create screening guidelines for the prevention and early detection of gastric cancer in the US,
and will help clinicians with precision prevention by laying the groundwork for the building of a risk prediction tool."
10914878,"Project Summary
Current proton and ion therapy treatment planning procedures utilize either the physical quantity linear
energy transfer (LET) as a surrogate for biological effectiveness or make use of relative biological
effectiveness (RBE) models that convert absorbed dose to biologically weighted dose, assumed to be iso-
effective to photons. LET is indeed important clinically for planning treatments with charged particles, but
there are known problems. Ion beams with the same LET can have different RBE, depending on particle type
and energy. Therefore, LET by itself is not an ideal parameter to use in radiation treatment planning (RTP).
For clinical application of carbon therapy, RBE-models have been developed. However, comparisons of
different RBE models used for carbon therapy have shown that dose prescriptions implemented with the
European local effect model or the Japanese National Institute of Radiological Sciences mixed beam model
can be up to 15% different. We use the term ionization detail (ID) to mean the detailed distribution of
ionizing events along a particle track on the nanometer scale. Our chief hypothesis, which is
supported by strong prior evidence, is that ID can predict, better than LET and existing RBE
models, the biological effects associated with high-LET radiation. We have previously shown how
ID can be used together with these models to improve their performance, providing a path for integrating
ID-based RTP into clinical practice. Our approach could lead to a consensus in proton and ion therapy RTP.
With four Specific Aims, we have chosen a translational and stepwise approach to build an ID-based
prediction model. We will test this model for different endpoints and model systems ranging from in vitro
cell and molecular data, obtained by irradiating human cancer cells in flasks and anatomical phantoms, to
in vivo mice/human tumor data. We will develop advanced algorithms and computational GPU-
based methods and use them for effective inverse treatment planning with actively scanned proton and ion
beams. This technology will be applied to demonstrate the practicality and evaluate the clinical efficacy of our
approach in prostate and chordoma treatments, first prospectively in human-size pelvis and head phantoms,
and finally, retrospectively in patients treated for these diseases. We have assembled a strong team with the
complementary expertise needed for this project. Members of our team have all successfully
collaborated together. Upon completion, we will provide a rigorously tested and validated approach to
ID-based particle RTP that will be available for cross-correlation with existing clinical data and for
careful testing in prospective clinical particle therapy trials."

10914129,"1 Abstract
 2 Breast cancer (BC) encompasses multiple diseases made up of different molecular subtypes that are
 3 characterized by distinct oncogenic drivers and unique treatment regimens. Despite these differences, across all
 4 subtypes, individuals with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease still have limited treatment options and
 5 poor overall survival outcomes. Immunotherapies offer an opportunity to treat patients regardless of molecular
 6 subtypes. This proposal leverages intratumoral (IT) immunotherapy as an alternative to ‘license’ treated lesions
 7 to yield productive ratios of T cells to suppressive immune subsets while amplifying immune checkpoint axes
 8 and ultimately increasing sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Using a model of TNBC and single
 9 cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that IT plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) can convert poorly immunogenic/low
10 TIL tumors into highly inflamed, immunologically active lesions through the coordinated upregulation of the
11 CXCR3 axis in infiltrating immune cells that impacts the migration, differentiation, and activation of both
12 innate and adaptive immune cells. This CXCR3 signature was also significantly enhanced in patients that had
13 an increase in CD8 T cell infiltration into treated tumors post IT pIL-12 therapy and prognostic of improved
14 overall survival. We hypothesize that targeting the CXCR3 axis IT will enhance TILs and convert patients into
15 ICI responders across all molecular subtypes of BC. The proposed work will leverage this preliminary data in
16 the following 3 aims: 1.) Demonstrate increased infiltration of tumor-specific T cells following IT pIL-12-EP
17 treatment and validate the induction of a CXCR3 or trafficking-associated gene signature in ICI responders 2.)
18 Evaluate the role of trafficking-associated proteins in enhancing responsiveness to anti-PDL1 in TNBC using a
19 CRISPR based screen; 3.) Assess IT injection of plasmid CXCL9 to determine if direct targeting of the CXCR3
20 axis is sufficient to enhance T cell infiltration. Dr. Crosby’s long-term goal is to build a research program that
21 contributes to an understanding of immune cell infiltration into tumors to better design, combine, and predict
22 responses to immunotherapies, with a specific focus on BC. A critical impediment to these types of studies is
23 the lack of oncogene-driven, spontaneous BC tumor models which hampers the translational applicability of
24 many pre-clinical findings. Key resources for Dr. Crosby’s independent research are the spontaneous HER2-
25 driven and p53/BRCA1/PTEN-driven TNBC models that she has created, published, and will uniquely possess
26 to perform these and many other studies. Addressing the basic question of how to enhance T cell infiltration
27 into tumors has significant implications for changing the paradigm of treatment for BC patients, particularly
28 using an intratumoral plasmid approach that is easily altered to follow up on newly identified targets. The
29 funding provided by this K22 award will protect Dr. Crosby’s research time to develop and publish these
30 foundational, studies which will support subsequent R01 grant submissions."
10914130,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Since the development of functional MRI (fMRI)-based neuroimaging
studies thirty years ago, extensive work has been undertaken to describe the intrinsic connectivity of the human
brain, both in response to external stimulus and in resting-state. There have been only modest improvements in
the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of fMRI, and resultingly, there have been limited clinical applications of fMRI,
as the CNR of fMRI limits its ability for individual-based functional neuroimaging.
 Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a novel imaging modality that capitalizes on the large magnetic
moment of injected super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for an improved CNR. By harnessing
the increased CNR of MPI, this proposal aims to validate the ability of fMPI to detect resting-state CBV
fluctuations and use these signals to map functional connectivity networks in analogy to resting-state fMRI (rs-
fMRI) correlation-based connectivity mapping. Recent work in our group has demonstrated the ability to detect
MPI-based physiological noise signals in a rodent model that scale with the dose of the injected magnetic SPION.
Building off this work and an on-going effort to construct a human MPI scanner, this proposal will characterize
the signal fluctuations in resting-state MPI tomographic time-series data and test the ability to generate functional
connectivity mappings from these signals. My central hypothesis is that armed with these prototype
scanners and an increased focus on signal sensitivity, the ratio of the physiological component of the
signal leveraged in correlational mapping to other, non-neuronally-generated fluctuations will be higher
in MPI than in conventional blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and more robust network maps
will result. I plan to generate the first MPI-based resting-state functional brain connectivity maps, compare to
rs-fMRI, and potentially demonstrate improved sensitivity to uncover subtle network alterations, thus potentially
advancing our ability to understand and phenotype individual patients with neuropsychiatric disease.
 In this proposal, I will first demonstrate the ability to characterize cortical association networks in rodents
using a small-bore MPI scanner, after improving existing image reconstruction methods. The second aim of the
proposal will focus first on updating the hardware of the human MPI scanner to harness the sensitivity of SPIONs
necessary to perform resting-state fMPI experiments and then on validating a stable and sensitive phantom
image time-series to detect hemodynamic fluctuations that dominate the physiologic “noise”. I will then validate
the ability to perform fMPI cortical association network characterization in a macaque model where a wide choice
of SPION tracer is available. The third aim is focused on performing rs-fMPI characterization studies in humans.
The successful completion of the proposal will determine the potential of MPI as a novel and highly sensitive
functional connectivity mapping modality advancing our ability to uncover altered brain networks in individual
patients with mental illness."
10914132,"Abstract – The identification of mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (mIDH1) gene has led to significant
advances in understanding lower grade gliomas. Lower grade gliomas, WHO grade II-III, can have a longer
median overall survival than WHO grade IV, yet they still develop significant neurological morbidity and ultimately
mortality, as standard of care therapies are not curative. New therapeutics are needed to target lower grade
gliomas to improve quality of life outcomes and survival for these patients. The mIDH1 mutation exists in over
70% of glioma subtypes and is the oncogenic driver in lower grade gliomas by leading to the extreme
overproduction of the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Because the mutation is specific to the tumor,
it provides significant targets for the development of: 1) targeted therapeutics, such as mIDH1/2 inhibitors and
immunotherapeutic vaccines (e.g., vorasidenib and PEPIDH1M, respectively) and 2) non-invasive tumor diagnosis
and monitoring methods, via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). More recently, it has been reported that
in addition to driving the oncogenesis of lower grade gliomas, 2HG has immunosuppressive actions. Its role as
a driver of gliomagenesis and now induction of immunosuppression of tumor-fighting T-cells places 2HG as a
critical target in fighting lower grade gliomas. Thus, we propose a clinical trial for a combined therapy of
vorasidenib and PEPIDH1M. We hypothesize that early suppression of 2HG by vorasidenib would allow
subsequent or concurrent administration of PEPIDH1M vaccine to generate a more robust T-cell response and
lead to increased immune-mediated tumor cell kill (Specific Aim 1). In this phase I, single-site clinical trial, we
will determine the safety of this combinatorial approach. Toxicity events will be evaluated and graded by CTCAE
5.0 criteria. The RANO criteria will be used to assess radiographic progression-free survival based on routine
MRI imaging. As an exploratory goal, we will map 2HG across the brain longitudinally using existing high-speed
magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and offline processing to monitor the effects of vorasidenib
(Specific Aim 2). Finally, in parallel with the clinical trial, we will convert the validated 2HG mapping tool into a
standardized works-in-progress (WIP) package for reporting 2HG levels on both GE and Siemens scanner
DICOM workflow (Specific Aim 3). This project builds on 1) our previous experiences participating in the early
clinical trials for PEPIDHM1 and vorasidenib, where we also characterized longitudinal 2HG levels, and 2) our
decades-long experience with automating MRS methods and translating them into manufacturer supported WIP
packages."
10914665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Urban youth in the United States are more likely to be exposed to licit and illicit substances, experience higher levels of
anxiety and depressive symptoms, and live in under-resourced areas. Such a disparity leaves urban youth at risk of poorer
health outcomes than their counterparts. Since youth substance use is on the rise, it is imperative for innovative methods
to be utilized in order to tackle this complex issue. The association between substance use, neighborhood characteristics,
and mental health outcomes in youth is emerging in the literature yet disparities continue to impact youth in urban
communities. Paterson, New Jersey is a northeastern, urban community which has one the highest rates of substance
abuse in the nation. Youth living in Paterson are overly exposed to drug use in their neighborhoods and have extreme
access to substances, leaving them more at risk to initiate use at earlier ages and more likely to become dependent into
adulthood. My research in this community has shown that neighborhood and community level characteristics, in addition
to depressive and anxiety symptoms among youth, can be key facilitators to early substance use. Previous research has
overwhelmingly placed the blame on individuals, particularly youth, as opposed to acknowledging the systemic structures
and the environmental context in which youth are nested. Although substance use prevention interventions exist, youth
who are the most vulnerable and often the hardest to reach, are not engaged in prevention interventions or connected to
resources. In order to reach this at-risk population, I propose to use an innovative method, venue-based sampling, to
recruit at-risk youth. The research addresses these specific aims:
 Aim 1: To examine the association between neighborhood characteristics, substance use, and mental health
symptoms among Paterson youth using quantitative and qualitative methods.
 Aim 2: Use findings from Aim 1 to inform the adaptation of a community-based and evidence-based substance
use prevention intervention for Paterson youth.
 Aim 3: Pilot the intervention on a sample of Paterson youth.
I hypothesize that there will be significant differences in risk and protective factors by race, gender, age, and
socioeconomic status among Paterson youth. This project will use multiple sources of data to inform findings and use
preliminary data to prepare a more robust R01 clinical trial application to be implemented in Paterson and other urban
cities that will account for unique differences in urban youth."
10914964,"Our optimal visual performance starts with the correct parallel visual information processing in the retina
which depends on precise retinal neural circuit formation. To achieve this, retinal neurons must accurately set
up functional synapses which require precise alignment between the pre-synaptic neurotransmitter releasing site
and the post-synaptic receptor. Increasing evidence suggests that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)-mediated
trans-synaptic complexes are critical for synapse formation and function, however, the mechanism how pre-
synaptic releasing machinery coordinates with the post-synaptic receptor signaling complex at retinal ribbon
synapses is largely unknown. We recently reported that the extracellular calcium channel auxiliary subunit α2δ4
is necessary for rod photoreceptor axonal elaboration and synapse formation and demonstrated that α2δ4 does
so through controlling the synaptic targeting of ELFN1, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein specifically expressed
at rod synapse and interacts trans-synaptically with the post-synaptic mGluR6 receptor. We also showed that
α2δ4 interacts with ELFN1 through the LRR domain, a conserved domain shared across many LRR proteins.
Interestingly, we and other lab identified another LRR protein termed LRIT1, which specifically affects cone
synaptic function. The objective of the proposed work is to determine whether it is a general mechanism that
pre-synaptic calcium channel complex utilizes α2δ4 to coordinate with post-synaptic receptor through the
facilitation of different LRR proteins. In Aim 1, we will determine the functional role of α2δ4-ELFN1 interaction in
rod synapse formation using in vivo electroporation combined with deletion mutagenesis. In Aim 2, we will study
how LRIT1 regulates cone synaptic function by testing whether LRIT1 affects pre-synaptic Cav1.4 channel
activity through α2δ4 using electrophysiological recording. In Aim 3, I will investigate whether synapses in the
inner plexiform layer (IPL) also adopt similar trans-synaptic mechanism by studying how α2δ4 and LRIT1 affect
RBC-AII amacrine synapse formation and function using the technique gained during the mentored phase. This
proposal is innovative because no mechanistic studies has been done on α2δ4 protein despite its clearly
important role in photoreceptor synapse formation and function. The proposed work is significant since results
from this study will enable better understanding of how retinal neurons establish and maintain synaptic contact."
10914966,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Single-cell technologies have become the cornerstone of biomedical and cell biology research. Next-
generation sequencing-based technologies have enabled large-scale characterization of transcript expressions
in single cells from clinical specimens and reveal unexpected cellular heterogeneity related to pathogenesis.
However, many integrative studies have shown only low to moderate correlations between the abundance of
RNA transcripts and their corresponding proteins, the main determinants of cell phenotype. We hypothesize
mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics could provide direct insight on the cellular heterogeneity and
inform protein markers related to disease progression and resistance to therapy. The overall objective of this
project is to develop a high throughput single-cell proteomics (scProteomics) platform to enable the routine
analysis of >10,000 single cells at a depth of 2000 proteins in a cost-efficient way. The developed technology
will be disseminated to the research community through close collaboration with a commercial partner. We will
also apply scProteomics to interrogate the heterogeneity of both malignant plasma cell and immune cell
populations from multiple myeloma patients. We will pursue these goals through three specific aims: 1) To
establish an ultra-high throughput single-cell preparation method by coupling an enhanced multiplexing method
with high-density nested nanoPOTS chips and multi-channel droplet dispensing system; We aim to process
>2000 cells in a single microchip, and multiplex-label 36 single cells for a single LC-MS analysis; 2) To
advance the throughput, sensitivity, and quantitation accuracy of LC-MS system. A dual-column nanoLC
system and a FAIMS-based MS acquisition method will be developed to enable the analysis of >860 cells per
day with high quantitation precision; 3) To apply scProteomics to profile ~10,000 plasma and immune cells
from MM patients. We will integrate scProteomics with existing scRNA-seq data to explore tumor
heterogeneity, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) markers, and the immune microenvironment in
multiple myeloma. This research is highly innovative because the proposed single-cell proteomics platform will
be the first of its kind to routinely and reliably characterize > 10,000 single cells at a throughput comparable to
single-cell transcriptomics. It is also the first scProteomics study of primary liquid tumor cells isolated from the
pathological environment, e.g. bone marrow of MM patients. Statement of Impact: Tumor heterogeneity has
indispensable implications in cancer evolution, tumoral spatial organization, and clinical treatment. Single-cell
proteomics could provide a basis to unravel these complicated relationships and to clarify the mechanisms of
cancer progression and subclone resistance to therapeutic treatments."
10914969,"ABSTRACT
Corneal nerves that mediate pain, blink reflexes and tear production are indispensable in the proper
maintenance of ocular surface homeostasis. However, the complexity of these neurons, both at the axon level
in the cornea, and cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, has made it increasingly difficult to grasp their full
nature, resulting in key knowledge gaps in the field. Consistent with the call for the current U01, we will
address this barrier via comprehensive analyses of corneal nerves at the morphologic, molecular, and
functional level. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise, enabling
integrated analyses of spatial, electrophysiologic, genomic and behavioral profiles in mice; and AI-assisted
structure-function studies in human subjects, to open new inroads in the field. In Aim 1, we will anatomically
and functionally map corneal-projecting trigeminal afferents in mice. Genetic approaches will be applied to
rigorously profile the spatial arrangement of nociceptors in the cornea and trigeminal ganglion using seven-
color immunolabeling. This spatial information will be directly linked with the electrophysiological profiling of
these respective populations. In Aim 2, genomic analyses of corneal-projecting trigeminal afferents will be
conducted applying a new platform for spatial RNA-seq at cellular resolution. We will use mouse strains to
parse out the transcriptomes and behavioral outputs at the genetic level. Moreover, we apply two novel
approaches to selectively target corneal nerves involved in tear production versus blinking. In Aim 3, we will
discover morphological patterns of corneal nerves that predict blinking, lacrimation, and nociception in humans.
We will image corneal nerves with in vivo confocal microscopy of subjects with differential blink, tear, and
nociceptive behavioral outputs, thereby capturing functional analogs of the mouse experiments in Aims 1 and
2. With the AI-based auto-segmentation algorithm that we are developing, we will be able to apply machine
learning for multidimensional profiling of nerve patterns, and then compare these with respective behavioral
outputs. These AI-guided efforts will provide critical clues for understanding corneal afferent structure-function
in humans. In summary, our collective studies will lead to an unprecedented cartography of corneal afferents in
blink, lacrimation, and nociception. The advancements from this work will be poised to facilitate a deeper
understanding of related pathobiology including neuropathic ocular pain and dry eye disease that will lay the
foundation for future translational and clinical research. All genomic, imaging and electrophysiologic datasets
produced will be made publicly available, and all software products for corneal nerve image segmentation will
be made freely available online as open-source and easy-to-use software packages."

Candidate: Dr. Jonathan Casey MD, MSCI is an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Dr. Casey has a strong background in clinical trials of critically ill adults obtained through formal training in
clinical research and the conduct of comparative effectiveness trials of respiratory support. His long-term
career plan as a physician scientist is to become recognized as a leader in the conduct of pragmatic trials of
early respiratory support in critically ill adults. To achieve this, his immediate goals are to adapt the pragmatic
trial methodology he has used in the intensive care unit to the chaotic environment of the emergency
department, become an expert in the forms of consent used in emergency research, gain experience applying
tools from implementation science to improve the quality of pragmatic trials, and learn the advanced modeling
methods required for enriching clinical trials and analyzing of heterogeneity of treatment effect.
Research Project: Each year more than 1.5 million critically ill patients receive mechanical ventilation in the
United States, and the placement of an endotracheal tube for mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients is
fraught with complications with one-in-five experiencing hypoxemia and one-in-forty experiencing cardiac
arrest. Bag-mask ventilation has been shown to prevent life-threatening hypoxemia among patients in the ICU,
but it is unclear if these results generalize to the ED and pre-hospital setting, where the majority of critically
patients are intubated. Due to differences in patient populations, patients in the ED are, on average, at lower
risk for peri-intubation hypoxemia and higher risk of aspiration (a proposed risk of bag-mask ventilation), and
bag-mask ventilation is rarely used in this setting. Improved understanding of the risks and benefits of bag-
mask ventilation during tracheal intubation in the ED is urgently needed. The Specific Aims of the proposed
research are: Aim 1) Develop a model to estimate the lowest oxygen saturation during tracheal intubation in
the ED; and Aim 2) Use the model from Aim 1 for prognostic enrichment, selectively enrolling patients at risk
for hypoxemia into the SAFEty of bag-mask VENTilation in the ED (SAFEVENTED) study, a 464-patient
randomized trial testing the hypothesis that bag-mask ventilation will increase the lowest oxygen saturation of
patients undergoing intubation in the emergency department.
Career Development: Dr. Casey's career development plan integrates coursework, experiential learning, and
training with his mentors to: 1) learn the modeling techniques required to develop and analyze the SAFE-
VENTED trial; 2) develop expertise in EFIC and other forms of consent used in emergency care research; and
3) leverage tools from implementation science to improve delivery of trial interventions during pragmatic trials.
Environment: As a supportive and well-resourced institution with international leaders in clinical trials,
emergency care research, human subjects protection, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, Vanderbilt is the ideal
environment to foster Dr. Casey's development into a national leader in trials of early respiratory support."

analysis of compounds of all types and sizes. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is an ambient ionization
method in which samples are analyzed in the open air by impact of primary droplets. Given the ability to position
an array of samples relative to the mass spectrometer, DESI-MS becomes a high throughput (HT) chemical
analysis method. The power of MS as an analytical technique is well known but it is less commonly realized that
MS can also serve as a preparative method, e.g. it can be used to deposit mass-selected ions on surfaces to
create new materials in vacuo. Of significant interest to organic synthesis, a unique feature of DESI is that, upon
impact, the spray of solvent used to analyze a reaction mixture generates secondary microdroplets in which
reactions may be accelerated en route to the mass spectrometer. It is this remarkable feature that makes DESI-
MS a powerful synthetic method combined with a built-in analytical capability. With support of DARPA, we built
a high throughput system at Purdue capable of automated reaction screening at a rate greater than 1 reaction
mixture per second. We now propose an intramural - extramural collaboration between Purdue and the NCATS
ASPIRE laboratory. The UG3 component of the collaboration will focus on designing, fabricating, and testing an
improved high throughput system for reaction screening based on DESI-MS. The system will replicate the
capabilities of the existing Purdue system and also include new capabilities for small-scale synthesis combined
with high throughput bioassays. In the UH3 phase of the proposed study, the system will be transferred to NCATS
and used in collaboration with the intramural group. As an initial demonstration of the new high throughput
platform capabilities, we will pursue the discovery of novel therapeutics for advanced-stage prostate cancer, for
which current chemotherapeutic agents show limited effectiveness. Specifically, this effort will entail large-scale
screening and synthesis of potential cholesterol sulfotransferase (SULT2B1b, a currently undrugged biological
target) inhibitory compounds, together with late-stage functionalization of bioactive scaffolds to generate a
diverse range of analogs. Through this effort, the system will be established as an all-in-one next-generation
drug discovery platform, with integrated screening, synthesis, and biological assay capabilities. During the latter
stages of the UH3 phase, the versatility of the system will be tested in several other biological applications,
including directed evolution and functionalization of acetylcholinesterase reactivators. Successful completion of
these tasks will demonstrate the newly constructed high throughput DESI-MS platform to be an efficient method
for the discovery and expansion of chemical space towards currently undrugged biological targets."
10928187,"Traumatic birth experience (TBE) is an underappreciated risk for postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder 
(p-PTSD), depression and anxiety, which contribute to significant social, medical, and economic burden. Both 
TBE and postpartum psychopathology are disproportionately experienced by underserved and minoritized 
populations, further widening the known gap in maternal health outcomes. We urgently need innovative, 
wholistic, strengths-based approaches to care for pregnant people with clear mechanisms of impact. 
Dispositional optimism (DO) is a resilience factor by which we can move the needle on maternal health, and 
has been associated with wide-ranging mental health benefits, including prevention and treatment of PTSD 
in non-pregnant populations. Mindfulness interventions show promise in improving DO and thus may be a 
transdiagnostic approach to bolstering resilience and positively impact health and health equity. However, 
this approach has not been utilized in a perinatal population. 
In this project, we propose a randomized clinical trial comparing use of an existing, equity-focused, perinatal 
mindfulness phone application (Expectful) to routine care for pregnant individuals with low DO. 100 
participants will be randomized in order to assess 1) feasibility and acceptability of the digital mindfulness 
intervention, 2) impact of Expectful on DO, TBE and p-PTSD, and 3) explore perspectives on the role of 
optimism and other resilience mechanisms in pregnancy experience and outcomes. 
Results from this trial will support a planned type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized trial to 
reduce TBE and p-PTSD, and reduce health disparities via improvements in DO."
10909157,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) can improve
declarative memory, reflecting the role of the BLA in modulating memory processes in medial temporal lobe
(MTL) regions as a function of emotional arousal. Thus, DES can reveal mechanisms of BLA-mediated memory
enhancement relevant to human mental health and disease. DES of the BLA can be used to interrogate the
function of memory circuits, especially how neuronal oscillations in the MTL support declarative memory. First,
BLA is hypothesized to wield the capacity to prioritize long-term retention of information initially encountered
adjacent in time. Second, the BLA preferentially projects to anterior MTL regions and thus is hypothesized to
preferentially modulate memory processes in those anatomic regions, processes thought to support memory for
non-spatial items more so than memory for spatial locations. Third, although emotional arousal, amygdala
activity, MTL activity, and memory performance are typically correlated, we hypothesize that DES will reveal that
BLA outputs to other MTL regions cause improved memory performance by directly eliciting pro-memory
oscillatory states in those networks. The expected outcomes represent a significant advancement for the basic
science of normal memory function and significant movement towards novel therapeutics designed to emulate
endogenous mechanisms of memory enhancement."
10909160,"ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent familial cancer syndrome affecting 1 in 3500 individuals worldwide.
The most commonly lethal feature associated with NF1 is malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST).
These soft tissue sarcomas are highly aggressive and frequently metastasize. Despite radiation and
chemotherapy, inoperable tumors rapidly progress and are universally lethal. As such, identifying effective
treatments for MPNST is critical.
The primary goal of this application is to establish a robust preclinical/clinical pipeline (bench-to-bedside and
back) to rapidly develop and test new (combination) therapies for this deadly malignancy. This effort will harness
the specialized expertise of clinical investigators at the NCI and Children’s National Medical Center, extramural
experts in NF1 biology and therapeutic development, and will leverage the unique resources of the NIH Clinical
Center. Specifically, new discoveries of mechanisms that drive NF1-related tumorigenesis together with recent
insights into the immunoreactivity of MPNST will be used to develop rational combination therapies and will be
tested in a robust preclinical MPNST mouse model (Karen Cichowski, BWH, extramural preclinical center).
These insights will then be used to perform clinical trials in MPNST patients with an emphasis on evaluating
more than one combination therapy within the same trial (Brigitte Widemann, NCI, Intramural NIH Clinical Center,
AeRang Kim, Children’s National Medical Center). This will allow for more timely identification of active agents
and will allow patients with this highly refractory disease to have more treatment options available to them.
Furthermore, the preclinical to clinical translation will be complemented by comprehensive genomic and
immunological analyses of tumor samples obtained prior to treatment and on treatment with novel agents in
order to identify mechanisms of response and resistance and to identify additional potential targets for therapy
(Jack Shern, NCI, Intramural NIH). As such, insight and samples from the clinic will serve as the foundation to
develop new or improve existing therapies, thus highlighting the iterative and collaborative nature of this pipeline.
Taken together, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of basic and clinical scientists from different fields
to develop and translate promising therapies for individuals with MPNST. This effort includes experts in NF1
biology and therapeutic development, a diverse set of clinicians with expertise in MPNST and immunotherapy,
and genomicists. Importantly, a subset of these investigators already have a track record of working together to
develop new trials for MPNST patients. This grant will allow more effective and rapid translation of promising
new therapies for MPNST and will expand the type of (combination) therapies that are developed, by bringing in
additional expertise and leveraging the unique resources of the NIH Clinical Center. Ultimately, these studies
have the potential to change the standard of care for the currently treatment refractory tumors associated with
the common familial cancer syndrome NF1."
10910034,"Project Summary
Our preliminary data suggested a shared paradigm for the impact of the STING-IFN-β/TGFβ/IL-17 cytokine
network on tumor progression and responses to therapy, which transcends the tissue origins of each cancer.
Our goal, to unravel the crosstalk and define the paradigms, necessitates standardization of the protocols and
procedures used by each constituent project, in order to unify our approaches in establishing preclinical tumor
models and measuring tumor responses to therapy. Our ability to reach meaningful conclusions critically hinges
on comparable execution of in vivo studies. Furthermore, a common readout shared by all three constituent
projects is the inflammatory status in the TME. While immune-supportive inflammation (CD8, Th1, and dendritic
cells) is associated with favorable responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, an immune-suppressive
inflammatory environment (immature myeloid cells and fibroblasts) can antagonize anti-tumor immunity.
Accurate detection, characterization and quantification of multiple cell types by flow cytometry and single-cell
sequencing are crucial for assessing the state of intra-tumoral inflammation. A shared infrastructure that enables
reliable analysis of the TME is essential for studying cytokine crosstalk. Taken together, the Animal Model and
Immunotyping Core will be charged with two missions. First, the Core will provide technical and experimental
infrastructure to enable uniform and standard in vivo analyses, including preclinical assessment of cancer
therapeutics and characterization of the TME. Secondly, the Core will function as a hub for interaction among
the constituent projects, including analytics assistance and scientific consultation on analyses of the TME."
10922264,"Project Summary/Abstract -- Overall
The long-term goal of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Matrix Biology is to
establish, enhance, and actively advance a multidisciplinary research center focusing on improving our
understanding of the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in development, health, and disease. Proposed
phase 3 plans will sustain the research capacity established during the previous phases by supporting
research core facilities and providing career development opportunities to investigators. Program
accomplishments in phases 1 and 2 include the establishment of a multidisciplinary cadre of investigators
working in matrix biology research, designing career development and mentoring programs, facilitating an
increase in research grant awards, and increasing the access to shared instrumentation within the COBRE
core facilities. Most importantly, a culture shift has occurred at Boise State from a primarily undergraduate
teaching university to a doctoral research institution. Phases 1 and 2 supported research projects from 21
investigators, eleven Research Project Leaders and ten additional Pilot Project Leaders that focused on the
ECM in breast cancer metastasis, ligament healing, liver fibrosis, cardiovascular health and disease, novel
biomaterials for tissue engineering, ECM targets for vaccine development, ECM in neuroinflammation,
mechanotransduction of forces from the ECM to the nucleus, skin cancer, and several others. As a result,
thirteen investigators were awarded R01-like funding. The COBRE program has positioned Idaho to make
significant contributions to solutions addressing national health concerns by advancing our understanding of
ECM and translating these findings into technologies and therapeutics. The center has built new laboratories
and established cores supporting proteomics and metabolomics, histology, microscopy, imaging, and
biostatistics/bioinformatics. COBRE investigators published 213 peer-reviewed manuscripts including
noteworthy articles in journals of high impact and 1,808 scientific presentations. Phase 3 is critically important
for us to continue our upward momentum toward our goals of research growth and sustainability. To achieve
this overarching goal, we will 1) solidify the collaborative, multidisciplinary research environment put in place
during the two previous phases, 2) administer a Pilot Projects Program that includes mentoring and training
opportunities, and 3) sustain and support the research cores that were developed during previous phases.
Upon successful completion of phase 3, we will have solidified the advances in research infrastructure that
supports investigators with shared priorities in understanding the role of the matrix in development and
disease. Shared core facilities will be sustainable and will support the needs of investigators. The research
infrastructure established during the three phases of the COBRE program will have a continued impact on
biomedical research at Boise State beyond phase 3."
10922266,"Project Summary/Abstract Biomolecular Research Core
The Biomolecular Research Core (BRC) of the COBRE in Matrix Biology is dedicated to supporting
investigators in mass spectrometry, histology and imaging, characterization of molecular interactions, and
design and development of tissue and cell-based models for the study of the ECM in a timely and reliable
manner. The BRC was the first biomedical research core facility at Boise State University. It represented an
initial step in Boise State’s trajectory to become a research university that makes significant strides in
addressing high impact biomedical research issues. Phases 1 and 2 of COBRE support resulted in the growth
of the BRC. To foster a sustainable research environment, the BRC is built on strong institutional support and
skilled research staff. The BRC has become a critical resource for COBRE investigators and many other
investigators across campus. During phase 3, the BRC will provide expertise for planning of experiments,
interpretation of research results, and preparation of publication quality figures and tables. Trained staff will be
available to provide technical expertise as needed and access to specialized equipment. BRC staff will provide
training to new users and early stage investigators as needed. Due to its importance to research infrastructure,
the university is committed to providing dedicated space, maintenance of essential equipment, and support for
training opportunities for new investigators. Institutional support exists for the Core Director, Associate Core
Director, biostatistician, and research technicians. Such support will enable sustainability of the BRC to support
biomedical research investigators as we focus on growing the user base both internally and externally.
Sustaining the infrastructure within the BRC will meet the needs of investigators and further, will allow
expansion of Boise State’s biomedical research capabilities. The BRC will support biomedical research training
and education programs for graduate students through formal courses, one-on-one training, and through
workshops. A business plan to allow sustainability will be based on a fee-for-service model and adopting best
practices of small businesses that apply to share core facilities. Aims for phase 3 include 1) expanding the user
base to ensure long-term sustainability and 2) maintaining effective management and operations for the core.
The BRC has become a key part of research programs across campus and will continue to provide services to
biomedical research investigators beyond phase 3 of the COBRE program."

The Biomolecular Research Vivarium (BRV) provides a centralized location for standard care and housing of
research animals, development of model systems for human diseases, standard training for new users, and
advanced training for specialized procedures. The BRV was established with strong institutional support and
relies on experienced vivarium staff. The BRV is a critical resource for the COBRE in Matrix Biology and other
Boise State University investigators. The BRV will build on the current diverse user base to create a stable and
reliable revenue stream for sustainability during phase 3 and beyond. Continuing education for BRV staff will
ensure the highest level of support for investigators and access to innovative techniques as they become
available. Continued investment in the capabilities of the BRV through COBRE phase 3 funds in combination
with institutional support will allow the BRV to continue to provide innovative approaches for animal research
and assist in the BRV’s transition to sustainability. Due to its importance to research infrastructure, the
university is committed to providing dedicated space, upkeep of essential equipment, and training effort for
new investigators. Institutional support is provided for the Core Director, Attending Veterinarian, Animal
Research Manager, and Animal Care Coordinators. To foster a sustainable research environment, the BRV is
dedicated to supporting investigators by providing essential training, care, housing, regulatory oversight,
production, preservation and sharing of mice, rats, and zebrafish models in a timely and reliable manner.
Strengthening the BRV will meet the needs of investigators and further, will allow expansion of Boise State’s
biomedical research capabilities. The BRV will continue to enhance our biomedical research training and
education programs for graduate students by providing training in the responsible conduct of research. The
BRV will also provide essential research infrastructure necessary for collaborative research with nearby
colleges and universities who do not have access to such facilities. A business plan to allow sustainability will
be based on a fee-for-service model. Aims include 1) expanding the user base to ensure long-term
sustainability, and 2) maintaining effective management and operations for the core. The BRV will continue to
provide support to the research community well beyond phase 3 of the COBRE program."

This specific Core will maintain a genetically diverse SPF rhesus macaque colony of Indian origin for use in AIDS-
related and other infectious or autoimmune disease-related research that requires data on the MHC class I or II
genetics. We have designed genetic management strategies for the CPRC SPF and conventional colonies since
2015 in order to efficiently monitor the genetic diversity of SPF animals. As a result, we have constructed
multigenerational pedigrees for the CPRC SPF program. We will use this relational database to aid researchers
in selecting appropriate animals for their specific needs, maintaining genetic diversity in the colony, and
enhancing the production of new SPF animals during the proposed project. Our genetic management plan aims
to minimize inbreeding and genetic subdivisions and retain diversity essential for sustaining the supply of NHP
for biomedical research. We will continue using STR-based parentage confirmation, pedigree construction, and
information on MHC class I, class II DRB, class II DQA/B, and class II DPA/B loci to manage the CPRC's SPF
rhesus macaques genetically. We have successfully integrated information on class I and II MHC data obtained
through the Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing methods into the colony's genetic database. The specific aim of the
MHC Typing Core is: To continue the comprehensive genetic management of the SPF colony including an

10920363,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The economy and the family—two social institutions that strongly affect health and
well-being in the US—have undergone profound change in the last half-century. The economy changed
through the stagnation of male wages, declining manufacturing jobs and rising service sector employment, and
increases in inequality. Simultaneously, US families experienced increases in instability (repeated changes in
parental marital/union status) and complexity (families that exist outside the typical nuclear family structure)
through the late 1990s, such that approximately 40% of children currently live in complex families. Local
economic conditions, like income inequality, are linked with singular family formation behaviors, like nonmarital
births. Yet, the relationship between local economic conditions and family instability and complexity remains
unknown. The objective of the proposed research project is to assess how local economic conditions—
unemployment rates, wage stagnation, occupational structure, and income inequality—are associated with
patterns of family instability and complexity, identifying how these associations developed over historical time
and vary by social location. Aim 1 will establish contemporary (1997-2017) patterns of family instability and
complexity by local economic conditions. Aim 2 will assess how changes in local economic conditions are
linked with changes in family instability and complexity over historical time, comparing three periods: 1969-
1975 (early family change), 1976-1996 (rapid family change), 1997-2017 (family change plateau). Aim 3 will
assess variation by race and educational attainment in the associations between local economic conditions
and family instability and complexity. The PI will use advanced quantitative methods—sequence analysis,
demographic decomposition, spatial data analysis, and causal inference techniques—to address these aims,
and the use of nationally-representative data will produce generalizable results. Collectively, the aims will
generate rigorous evidence on (1) whether and how local economic conditions affect patterns of family
structure change, and (2) which children are most likely to be exposed to family instability and complexity.
These findings are relevant to population health because family instability and complexity compromise the
health and well-being of parents and children. This research project is part of a broader, 3-year postdoctoral
training fellowship at a top research university, supervised by a team of mentors with expertise in family demo-
graphy and economic inequality. The training plan comprises: (1) substantive training in family demography,
economic conditions, and economic inequality; (2) advanced quantitative methods training that will facilitate a
career in population health-relevant research; and (3) professional development through increased research
independence, grant writing, conference presentations, and networking. The training plan will prepare the PI to
conduct innovative research on how social and economic conditions shape family structure trajectories across
the lifespan, which has consequences for population dynamics and population health."
10920365,"Project Summary
 While survival rates for critically ill patients during their acute illness continues to improve, the long-term
outcomes for these patients are dismal. When ICU survivors progress to a state of chronic critical illness (≥14
days in the ICU), the majority develop significant disability and prolonged recovery times fraught with multiple
complications. Ultimately, about 50% eventually succumb to their illness at one year. Unfortunately, once
patients progress to a state of chronic critical illness, there is nothing more than supportive care. Given that the
healthcare costs required to manage these patients is estimated to be over $20 billion per year, chronic critical
illness is creating a new health care crisis. As an ICU physician and basic science researcher, I have the
unique ability to both manage these patients at the bedside and actively investigate new ways to improve their
care. With all the effort invested in these patients to help them survive their acute illness, it seems like a failure
that we are not able to help them long term.
 The greatest risk factor for the progression to chronic critical illness is the profound immunosuppression
that can occur. In the normal response to injury or infection, both the innate and adaptive immune systems
deactivate once the inflammatory insult is cleared. However, with a significant insult, such as trauma or sepsis,
deactivated immune cells are replaced by more immature cells from the bone marrow that have decreased or
suppressive activity and may be unable to effectively eradicate the source. Many have been able to show this
immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients, but no one has been able to reverse this response. This
proposal synergizes both human and animal studies to better understand the diversities on how individuals
respond to a significant injury or infection and attempt to reverse any immunosuppression that may occur. In
the first project, four different murine models of injury or infection are utilized and the immune profile of each
individual mouse is identified. If they display any type of suppression in their innate or adaptive immune
system, or both, specific reversal agents are administered to determine if we can improve their immune
response. In the second project, blood samples from critically ill patients admitted to the Surgical ICU are
analyzed to determine their immune profiles over the first two weeks of admission. Univariate and multivariate
regression analyses will then be performed to determine which immune phenotypes are associated with worse
outcomes, with the primary outcome being chronic critical illness. Successful completion of these studies will
significantly advance the field of immune phenotypes and set the groundwork for developing individualized
immune therapies for a variety of critically ill patients."
10920445,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) young adults (ages 18-24 years), with gender identities differing from their sex assigned at birth, are a growing NIH-designated health disparities population. TGD young adults suffer higher rates of suicide than their cisgender counterparts; over half contemplate suicide in their lifetime. These and other health disparities are compounded for TGD young adults who are Black or Hispanic and experience both gender- and racebased stigma and minority stress. Black young adults are also at an increased risk of suicide; attempts increased 73% from 1991 to 2017. Interventions are needed urgently to improve the mental health of TGD young adults, particularly TGD young adults who are also racial minorities. We propose a transformative, multi-level intervention to advance equity and reduce health disparities for TGD young adults through individual, interpersonal, systemic, and community-based changes that increase knowledge and support among providers, young adults, and caregivers, thereby reducing suicidality and improving mental health. Provider and family/caregiver support are known to be critical determinants of mental health outcomes for TGD young adults, yet no large-scale interventions exist to address these remediable structural and social determinants of health. Our intervention has two components. The first is a provider training and support program. This entails a free online training course for continuing education credit that teaches providers how to support and communicate effectively with TGD young adults and a provider network for increasing psychosocial support. The second is an interactive educational digital platform for TGD young adults and caregivers. The digital platform provides expert-generated knowledge via educational modules and uses interactive features to promote communication and strengthen relationships between young adults and caregivers. We will use a Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to optimize the platform for testing in a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial with an Immediate Arm (upfront access) and Deferred Arm (access at 6 months). The intervention period for each Arm will last 6 months, followed by an observation period of up to 12 months with continued access. Using validated subscales, we will assess changes in the proportion of individuals reporting suicidal ideation in the prior three months (primary outcome) and in psychological distress and anxiety, caregiver support, and health care empowerment (secondary outcomes), as well as dose effects, heterogeneity of treatment effects across groups, and within- group resilience factors. This innovative, multi-level intervention fulfills a significant unmet need for near-term and sustainable solutions to the health disparities faced by TGD young adults and addresses intersecting forms of stigma and inequity to transform mental health outcomes for a highly vulnerable, at-risk young adult population."
10920368,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
As an internationally recognized physician-investigator, I have dedicated my career to the prevention of
colorectal cancer (CRC). My most substantial contributions have influenced the evidence base supporting
aspirin’s effectiveness in reducing the risk of CRC and uncovered key molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-
cancer activity. This work has helped advance the field to a first-if-its-kind milestone recommendation for
population use of aspirin for cancer prevention by the US Preventive Services Task Force. However, growing
data demonstrates that the effect of aspirin may differ according to host factors, including the gut microbiome
and age, suggesting that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to aspirin chemoprevention is limited. Thus, developing
novel approaches to prevention through molecular risk stratification is a high priority. Building on my expertise
in molecular epidemiology, clinical trials, the gut microbiome, and clinical cancer prevention, my research vision
is to develop a comprehensive Precision Prevention Research Program (PPRP) through this NCI Outstanding
Investigator Award. The overarching goal of this PPRP is to leverage complementary sources of human data,
including population-based studies, clinical cohorts, and “living biobanks” to study the entire continuum from
healthy individuals to advanced cancer patients and with resolution from single cells to large populations to
acquire a more complete, multifaceted view of how interventions can be tailored to prevent cancer. Our PPRP
facilitates mechanistic discovery in population studies that can lead to rapid testing of novel, molecularly-inspired
biomarkers in clinical cohorts, creating opportunity for “living biobanks” for rigorous validation and advanced
mechanistic investigation. Moreover, this model is reciprocal. Our clinical cohorts and translational tools using
patient-derived experimental systems may also identify novel mechanisms that can be examined within the
context of our population studies to confirm their relevance to cancer and improve generalizability. Through this
R35, I will develop and expand this PPRP through expansion of my work in aspirin chemoprevention. Aspirin is
an exemplar agent to develop this platform since efficacy for CRC prevention has already been established and
its association with adverse effects, such as bleeding, necessitate a tailored approach. As the Lancet Oncology
Commission report concluded: “Perhaps the most promising precision-based approach to cancer prevention in
the near future involves molecular selection for repurposed low-dose aspirin” and “in view of aspirin’s potential
adverse effects (e.g., bleeding), tailoring aspirin use is a high priority”. By enhancing understanding of aspirin’s
mode of action, this proposal may lead to novel mechanistic biomarkers or complementary preventative
interventions that may maximize the benefits of aspirin while minimizing the harms. Over the long-term, I envision
that this work will provide proof-of-concept for expansion of the PPRP program as a cost-efficient platform within
which to move additional cancer preventive interventions rapidly into the clinic."
10920374,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US,
particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational
age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2
diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to
experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid
detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes.
GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically
important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically
unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and
child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is
poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across
pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term
outcomes.
Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed
metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with
perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first
trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT,
and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures
relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables
(Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal
outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and
diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic
biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation
that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of
metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening
regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies."

jointly by health services researchers, gerontologic nursing researchers, and geriatricians with a strong
commitment to bringing together students and fellows in all these disciplines to develop expertise in the
content areas and methodologies that are essential to advancement of the field and an understanding of how
health services, care delivery and financing systems might optimally be designed to serve the needs of older
adults. This training program will capitalize on the rich resources for health services, gerontology, nursing, and
geriatric research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH), the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine (SOM), School of Nursing (SON), and the University. Pre- and post-doctoral trainees will
obtain the skills and experiences needed to lead multi-disciplinary, collaborative research teams. Pre-doctoral
trainees will undertake a rigorous program of coursework in the core domains of public health and gerontology
including epidemiology, biostatistics, health services, health policy, and research ethics. In close consultation
with their training program advisor team, post-doctoral trainees will complete core training grant curriculum
courses and additional courses required to complement their prior academic experience. All pre- and post-
doctoral trainees will participate in a year-long practicum experience, a bi-weekly seminar, ongoing mentored
research projects, and yearly integrative activities to complement their didactic curriculum. These components
will provide trainees with a solid foundation in health services and outcomes research while providing the
opportunity to pursue specialized training in focal areas of interest. The program will include 6-8 trainees: 3-4
pre-doctoral students and 2-4 post-doctoral fellows per year. These trainees will be supported by an
experienced group of 22 core faculty and 31 affiliate faculty with expertise in one or more fields related to aging
research. The training program Co-Directors, Drs. Jennifer Wolff and Cynthia Boyd are accomplished scholars
and national leaders in their research fields who have a strong track record of co-mentorship. A nationally
recognized Advisory Committee will provide high-level guidance. The training program will be housed in the
JHSPH Department of Health Policy and Management and run jointly with the JHSOM Division of Geriatric
Medicine and Gerontology, with strong ties to Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. The overarching aim of the
program is to identify and train scholars who will become leaders in person and family-oriented research

10920464,"We propose to generate barcoded and conditional null
alleles in a cellular system that can model early human development and a broad range of human
diseases. We will establish a data production research and development center in response to the
RFA-HG-21-029: Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) Phase 1, which aims to
establish a catalog of molecular and cellular phenotypes of null alleles for ultimately every human gene,
using in vitro multicellular systems. Our center will utilize a chemically inducible and reversible system
that enables the rapid depletion of target proteins. The approach permits temporal control of protein
levels to study the consequences of null alleles. We will utilize a super sensitive degron that rapidly
degrades the target protein of interest in response to a low dose of auxin, a cell membrane diffusible
small chemical plant hormone. We will combine CRISPR-based targeted locus engineering to
homozygous knock-in a mini auxin-inducible degron (mAID) at the end of the targe gene to create a
chemically controllable switch to create null-alleles in an open-access human induced pluripotent stem
(hiPSC) cell, which can be differentiated into various cell lineages and multicellular organoids to model
human development and diseases. Notably, each AID-degron will also contain gene-specific barcodes,
allowing tracking the fate of hundreds of thousands of null alleles when these engineered null alleles
are pooled.
The proposed approach is generalizable and can rapidly deplete target proteins codded by various
classes of human genes. Our strategy will be particularly advantageous and critical to study the null
phenotypes of essential genes, which cannot be studied by chronic depletion using genetic approaches
(such as CRISPR KO) because the knock-in results in cell death. Therefore, to highlight the utility of
our strategy, we prioritize creating null alleles by CRISPR mediated knock-in process to introduce
barcoded AID degron in 250 essential genes. We chose genes implicated in human diseases and subviable
phenotypes in the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). We propose to catalog
the cellular phenotypes (survival, proliferation, mitotic function, and differentiation) and molecular
phonotypes, including gene expression and chromatin accessibility for select null alleles. This
information will provide unique insights into the biological function of these developmentally critical
genes. It will highlight the utility of establishing the chemically inducible degron system as a
generalizable strategy for the goals of the MorPhiC consortium. The created barcoded and conditional
null allele resource will provide a unique opportunity to temporally control the timing of null alleles in
pluripotent stem state and various terminally differentiated cell types or multicellular organoid systems
that can be generated from the pluripotent stem cells."

Unintended pregnancies put women at risk of poor maternal and child health outcomes. In India, half of all
pregnancies are unintended and younger women have the highest risk of having an unmet need for
contraception. New evidence suggests that young, newly married women in this setting desire to postpone
pregnancy, yet have low use of contraception and high rates of unintended pregnancy, and desire reproductive
health knowledge. Young women in India also have low empowerment, and desire training in life skills that
could be used to help them gain status and opportunity in their households and communities. Few rigorously
designed and tested interventions have focused on women’s empowerment (including life skills and health-
related) and unintended pregnancy, especially among young, married women in India. This proposal tests the
impact of a combined life skills and health empowerment intervention for young married women on avoiding
unintended pregnancy, and other health and empowerment outcomes. The intervention, DAMINI, is currently
on-going in villages in Uttar Pradesh, India, and the goal of this proposal is to conduct a two-arm randomized
cluster study of (1) DAMINI (life skills and health empowerment); and (2) the standard of care health education
and access to contraceptives provided by community health workers. This approach will focus on recently
married women aged 18-25 years who are at risk of pregnancy but do not want a pregnancy at the time of
enrollment and will follow them for two years post-intervention through in-person surveys. DAMINI is delivered
in groups and we will work in 40 intervention and 40 control village clusters; with 1 group per cluster and 6-7
women in each cluster/group (total N=520). We will also collect longitudinal triadic in-depth interviews with
newly married women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law to understand changing norms and pathways of
impact. The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of DAMINI on the risk of having an unintended
pregnancy, compared to health education alone. Survival analysis of time to pregnancy (primary outcome) will
be used to analyze the impact on unintended pregnancy. Given potentially different factors affecting parous vs.
nulliparous women, we will model the effect of DAMINI on them separately, and include parity specific
measures such as sex of previous births and duration since marriage.The second aim is to assess the
effectiveness of DAMINI on intermediary outcomes related to life skills and health empowerment, compared to
health education alone, using the same methodological approach. Finally, to inform future implementation
research, we will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to conduct a mixed methods process
evaluation with participants and their households and DAMINI and community leaders. This will also include an
economic evaluation, specifically a cost effectiveness analysis. If proven effective, it is anticipated that this
intervention could be integrated into existing self help groups and scaled up in India (and other parts of South
Asia) to improve women and children’s health, long-term economic and empowerment related outcomes."

This is an application for Dr. Daniel Clark for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award
(K08). Dr. Clark has been training to establish himself as an investigator in basic science research of
osteoimmunology, and this award will provide Dr. Clark with the support and opportunities necessary to reach
his career goal of being an independent researcher. In pursuit of his career goal, the K08 award will allow Dr.
Clark to: (1) to become an expert in osteoimmunology; (2) develop an independent research program through
novel application of osteoimmunology to the investigation of periodontal disease; (3) create a productive and
impactful publication record; (4) enhance grant writing skills and create a record of successful utilization of past
and current awards. Towards his career goal, Dr. Clark has established a transdisciplinary team to provide their
expertise in research training and mentorship in career development. Primary mentor Dr. Ralph Marcucio (expert
in bone biology) and co-mentor Dr. Mary Nakamura (immunologist and expert in osteoimmunology) will provide
foundational training in osteoimmunology, and co-mentor Dr. Yvonne Kapila (leading dentist-scientist and
periodontal basic science researcher) will provide expertise and guidance for osteoimmunological applications
to periodontal disease research. In addition, collaborators Drs. Marina Sirota, Eben Alsberg, and Saul Villeda
will provide their expertise of bioinformatics, cell-based therapeutics, and aging biology respectively. Immune
system dysfunction increases with age and is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of
inflammatory conditions in elderly populations, including periodontal disease. The cellular and molecular process
regulating the inflammatory response that become perturbed by age are unknown. Dr. Clark's long term goal is
to identify cellular and molecular targets for immunomodulatory treatment of periodontal disease. The objective
of this proposal is to understand how a key cellular regulator of the innate inflammatory response, macrophages,
interacts with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Th17 cells, to regulate inflammation in bone and how these
processes become dysregulated with age. Dr. Clark will utilize primary cell lines from young and old mice and a
periodontal disease mouse model to investigate (1) the extent to which macrophages and MSCs interact through
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) to downregulate inflammation; (2) the extent to which
an aged macrophage phenotype drives pathogenic Th17 cell expansion; (3) and demonstrate the effect of
immunomodulation with cell-based therapeutics that target age-related perturbations to rejuvenate the immune
response in periodontal disease. Further single cell analysis and bioinformatics techniques will produce
transcriptomic datasets to identify gene expression signatures associated with aging and inflammatory
dysregulation. Findings from this project will improve our understanding of immune regulation in bone, introduce
novel targets for therapy, and provide Dr. Clark with a novel independent research program."

Vision at the center of gaze (fovea) has high sensitivity and resolution, facilitating good performance in many
tasks. But performance worsens with increasing distance from fovea–eccentricity. At any given eccentricity
stimuli can fall anywhere along the circle –polar angle. Both eccentricity and polar angle have pronounced effects
on perception in human adults. These factors present an ideal opportunity for establishing tight quantitative links
between behavior and neural representations of visual information. Our long-term goal is to understand how
visual performance varies across the visual field, to develop a theory of spatial vision that includes the neural and
computational mechanisms underlying performance variation with eccentricity, polar angle and individuals. Such
a theory will be applicable to basic and translational research in perceptual and cognitive neuroscience. We
propose to investigate whether and how neural and computational factors distinctly limit discriminability across
observers, eccentricity and polar angle. Our overall hypothesis is that variability in cortical magnification limits
discriminability as a function of eccentricity, polar angle and observer, and that these effects are mediated by
different combinations of noise, efficiency and sensory tuning. The proposed psychophysical [Aim 1] and
neuroimaging [Aim 2] measures will characterize internal/neural noise and sensory/neural tuning across
eccentricity and around polar angle, and will constrain a computational observer model of contrast sensitivity and
acuity tasks [Aim 3].
In addition to advancing our knowledge of visual perception and cognitive neuroscience, the proposed research
will enable us to make predictions about human performance. The characterization of eccentricity and polar
angle has significant implications for ergonomic and human factors applications as well as for public health. For
example, it is of critical importance for user-interfaces that present information at different locations of the visual
field. We can extend our knowledge to real-world displays, such as navigation and cockpit alerting systems,
control panel layouts in cars, computer-aided detection systems, and software for presenting radiological images.
Furthermore, the gained knowledge can aid the design of artificial image recognition systems. In addition,
understanding the underlying neural and computational mechanisms of performance differences across the
visual field will improve our models of visual dysfunction (e.g., macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa), as
well as the diagnosis of these disorders."
10917165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genomic mapping of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), chromatin-associated proteins
(CAPs), and DNA methylation (DNAme) is a powerful approach for biomedical research and drug development.
Current genomics assays (e.g. ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN) rely on second generation short-read sequencing (SRS),
wherein short reads (<500bp) limit the ability to a) analyze concordance of epigenomic features on a single DNA
molecule and b) map to repetitive regions of the genome. Third generation long-read sequencing (LRS) platforms
are capable of sequencing long reads (>10kb, even >100kb) from a single molecule, and are poised to
revolutionize genomics by overcoming the significant limitations of SRS. By preserving long stretches of DNA,
LRS allows relationships between features on a single molecule to be used to resolve heterogeneity within mixed
populations. This is highly relevant for clinical applications, as it enables analysis of signatures of specific cells
within a sample without the need for single cell assays (which generate very sparse data). Further, sequencing
of long reads allows mapping to challenging and repetitive regions of the genome, which were previously
“unmappable” with SRS. Development of epigenetic mapping assays that use LRS provides an unprecedented
opportunity to decipher the chromatin landscape of cells within mixed populations, including within previously
unmappable genomic regions. However, assays to measure epigenetic elements using LRS are lacking.
 Here, EpiCypher is collaborating with LRS expert Dr. Winston Timp at Johns Hopkins University to
develop CUTANA-LRS, a first-in-class multiomics assay platform that leverages LRS to simultaneously profile
histone PTMs or CAPs and DNAme in a single assay. The innovation of CUTANA-LRS is the development of a
proprietary, nondestructive approach for epigenomic mapping that leverages a novel DNA methyltransferase
fusion protein to label chromatin features of interest. This approach was inspired by related immunotethering-
based approaches for genomic mapping that EpiCypher is developing and commercializing (e.g. CUT&RUN).
In CUTANA-LRS, DNA molecules are labeled and preserved intact for LRS, which will allow resolution of
heterogeneity within / between data types, and will provide access to previously unmappable genomic regions.
Together, these advances will provide a pathway to better understand mechanisms of gene regulation and
transcriptional response, including in the context of human disease. In Aim 1, we will optimize CUTANA-LRS
and map multiple targets, including within challenging regions, while also profiling native DNAme. In Aim 2, we
will rigorously develop CUTANA-LRS by optimizing robust protocols across diverse targets, inputs, sequencing
platforms, and incorporate a targeted enrichment approach. In Aim 3, we will prepare for commercial launch of
CUTANA-LRS, develop automated protocols, perform external validation, and demonstrate a clinical application.
This work will establish CUTANA-LRS as a revolutionary platform for mapping and deciphering the relationships
between multiple types of chromatin features with access to previously “unmappable” regions."

Eliminating racial/ethnic cardiovascular health disparities in the U.S. cannot be achieved without addressing
disparities in evidence-based treatment of hypertension. In Los Angeles County (LAC), there are
approximately, 801,000 Latino, 266,000 Asian, and 244,000 African American adults with hypertension, and
more than half of these individuals have household income below 200% of the federal poverty level. In the LAC
Department of Health Services (DHS), the second largest municipal health system in the US, patient, clinician,
healthy system, and community factors contribute to substantial disparities in hypertension prevalence, control,
and outcomes by race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic gaps that contribute to hypertension disparities in LAC DHS
relate to differences in healthy eating, physical activity, obesity, antihypertensive pharmacotherapy use,
medication adherence, community awareness of hypertension, and community-level physical and social
resources. These gaps are widely recognized in LAC DHS as barriers to addressing hypertension-related
racial/ethnic health disparities, yet differences in healthy lifestyle practices and treatment persist. We propose
to significantly reduce disparities in in LAC DHS by leveraging our team's expertise in multi-ethnic, multi-level
evidence-based strategies, community/stakeholder engagement, public-private partnerships, implementation
science, and behavioral economics. Our proposal is sensitive to LAC DHS' mission of providing high quality,
cost-effective care, which we address with an ancillary focus on reducing the high cost of hypertension-related
heart and kidney disease. Using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework,
we propose a multi-level intervention for hypertension control that will complete EPIS Exploration/Preparation
stages in the UG3 phase and the Implementation/Sustainment stages in the UG4 phase. In partnership with all
51 adult primary care clinics in LAC DHS, our aims are: Aim 1 (UG3): Assess multi-level (patient, clinician,
health system leadership, and community) barriers to, facilitators of, and preferences for a menu of culturally-
tailored evidence-based practices (EBPs) and implementation strategies with established efficacy for
hypertension control. Aim 2 (UG3): Select and systematically apply behavioral economics to the design of our
patient-, clinician-, and community-directed implementation strategies to maximize acceptability, uptake, and
effectiveness. Aim 3 (UG4): Test the effectiveness of our implementation strategies in a stepped-wedge
cluster randomized trial design using RE-AIM to guide assessment of uncontrolled hypertension, disparities in
comparison to non-minority LAC populations, and evidence-based practices."
10917342,"Project Summary:
Human genetic studies have linked autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) to disruption of
genes encoding epigenetic factors. While mutations in these genes can affect more than one pathway that leads
to ASD, identification of a common molecular pathway across genetic causes of ASD can provide insight into
broadly applicable therapies. Recent evidence from our laboratory suggests that a neuronal-specific form of DNA
methylation is a shared epigenetic modification that is disrupted in ASD-associated neurodevelopmental disease.
 Though DNA methylation is classically considered to only occur in mammalian cells in the CpG context,
neurons are uniquely enriched for methylation in non-CpG contexts established by DNMT3A. This non-CpG
methylation primarily occurs at CA dinucleotides (mCA) and is critical for proper neuronal development and
function. Though mCA plays an important role in regulating neuronal gene expression, it is not known how the
mCA landscape is faithfully established across the neuronal genome, and whether additional NDDs involve
disruption of mCA. Recent studies outside the nervous system have suggested that histone modifications may
play a central role in directing DNMT3A-mediated DNA methylation across the genome, but it is not known to
how these histone modifications influence DNMT3A and mCA throughout the neuronal genome.
 Intriguingly, mutations in H3K36 histone methyltransferases have been recently identified in ASD gene
studies. Additionally, recent studies conducted outside the nervous system have suggested that H3K36
methylation recruits DNMT3A and regulates its activity. In this proposal, I will determine how disruption of H3K36
methylation-mediated interactions with DNMT3A disturbs critical patterns of mCA across the neuronal genome
to drive brain dysfunction. In Aim 1, I will disrupt NDD-relevant H3K36 methyltransferases and measure how
DNMT3A recruitment and mCA are affected. This will define the mechanisms underlying histone and DNA
modification dynamics on regulating neuronal transcription and building our basic understanding of how
disruption of mCA drives disease. In Aim 2, I will explore how loss of H3K36 dimethylase NSD1 causes
dysregulation of neuronal genes via shared neuronal chromatin pathology observed across heterogenous clinical
syndromes of ASD. I will use genomic approaches to examine how altered DNA methylation as a result of NSD1
loss affects enhancer activity to drive transcriptional dysregulation in nervous system dysfunction and disease.
This analysis will begin to identify key downstream chromatin associated factors across a common molecular
pathway involved in multiple genetic causes of ASD to provide insight into functional cellular outcomes and
broadly applicable therapies."

Standardized protocols can reduce the impact of implicit bias but are underused. Since the Institute of
Medicine’s report, “Unequal Treatment”, multiple studies have confirmed that standardization of decision-
making processes reduces bias, but bias in the allocation of advanced therapies has not been addressed.
Using an evidence-based framework for behavior change [Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behavior
Change/Behavior Change Wheel (COM-B/BCW)], we developed a standardized protocol strategy, Seeking
Objectivity in Allocation of Advanced Heart Failure (SOCIAL HF), that addresses significant barriers to equity in
advanced therapies: 1) bias, 2) subjectivity in evaluation of social support and adherence, and 3) poor group
dynamics. Thus, SOCIAL HF includes: 1) evidence-based bias training tailored for HF, 2) restriction to
objective evaluations of social support and adherence, and 3) environmental restructuring and modeling of
meeting settings to include anonymous electronic voting and equitable seating arrangement. In complex
decision-making that includes individuals and groups, our standardized protocol strategy, SOCIAL HF, has the
greatest likelihood of achieving health equity in advanced HF. Our goal is to assess real-world effectiveness
(Aim 1) and implementation (Aim 2) of SOCIAL HF for allocation of advanced HF therapies, heart transplant
and ventricular assist device implantation. We will use a cluster randomized design to test the effectiveness of
SOCIAL HF strategy. We will evaluate implementation of SOCIAL HF across study sites using mixed-methods
in order to learn optimal implementation strategies to achieve equity. We will use normalization process theory
to evaluate how SOCIAL HF affects processes and outcomes important to advanced HF centers (e.g.
fidelity/variation). We will use RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance) to evaluate factors that promote reach and adoption and resources needed for implementation.
We have the relationships, infrastructure, and expertise to execute this project; our multidisciplinary team
includes experts in HF, evidence-based bias reduction training, clinical trials, mixed-methods, and
implementation science."
10917167,"An understanding of cancer immune evasion has recently led to revolutionary immunotherapies and a
subsequent rush, by both industry and academia, to identify additional mechanisms of immune suppression
employed by cancer cells. Since these efforts rely on models of full-fledged cancer, there remains a neglected
opportunity to target neoplasms prior to the development of immune evasive character. The lack of models for
tracing de novo somatic transformation in vivo has prevented direct characterization of early carcinogenesis,
including the first interactions with immune cells. To address this deficiency, a novel mouse model has been
developed, which allows fluorescent tracing of individual transformed clones in the skin. A special transplant
technique has been used to integrate fluorescent, transformation-inducible keratinocytes into the epidermis of
an immunocompetent mouse, where they generate isolated, homeostatic clones. These colonies can be non-
invasively imaged at subcellular resolution via intravital confocal microscopy as transformation is induced. This
technique provides the first-ever direct visualization of cancer development in situ. Since immunity represents
a pivotal barrier to the successful outgrowth of neoplasms, this model was engineered to allow visualization of
immune cells, as well. The concept of immunoediting provides a framework for how cancers evolve immune-
evasive strategies during their development. Immunoediting includes a prolonged dormancy, termed the
“equilibrium phase”, during which immunity prevents tumor outgrowth without destroying the transformed cells.
For the first time, this model allows the observation of all three phases of immunoediting: elimination,
equilibrium, and escape, and reveals that the normal tissue microenvironment plays a central role in early
immune evasion. This novel model also reveals a role for innate immune cells in the early stages of immune
surveillance of skin cancer and in the maintenance of the equilibrium phase. During the equilibrium phase,
transformed cells may be uniquely sensitive to interventions since their lower numbers and relative
homogeneity will hinder development of resistance mechanisms. The ability to visualize de novo
transformation in this model allows this hypothesis to be tested. In addition, this model will allow the
characterization of mechanisms that mediate the hidden events of immunoediting. New preliminary data reveal
that the transition from equilibrium lesions to escape tumors involves the upregulation of TGFβ3 in escape
tumors, which concurrently undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The increased levels of TGFβ3 convert
NK cells, that can inhibit tumor growth, into intermediate type 1 innate lymphoid cells that cannot inhibit tumor
growth. This revised application will further pursue both cellular and molecular mechanisms suggested by
these preliminary data. Finally, the ability to visualize immune-mediated dormant lesions may uncover potential
biomarkers, which might be translatable for early detection in high-risk human patients, such as
immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients, who have a 100-fold increased risk of developing skin cancer."
10917061,"This proposed project focuses on quantifying the spatial and temporal diversity in cortical oxygen metabolism and neurovascular coupling, and informing next generation of biophysical models of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measurements by integrating new technological and conceptual approaches. Broad and long term objectives of this application are (1) to bridge understanding of brain in action at multiple scales in spatial (subcapillary to whole- brain) and temporal (µs to months) domains, (2) to contribute discovering diversity of hemodynamic responses across cortical tissue layers, functional areas, and microvascular branches, and (3) to support the modelling efforts of BOLD signal by to quantifying hemodynamic responses in cortex of healthy-aging awake mice. Realizing these objectives would contribute to the joined efforts towards improving human health through accomplishing BRAIN Initiative goals of understanding the brain in action, discovering diversity, mapping/linking activity across spatial and temporal scales, and understanding the biophysical basis of fMRI signal. The specific aims of the proposed project can be summarized as: (1) to develop faster, deeper, longitudinal measurements of the cerebral blood flow (CBF), partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), (2) to quantify the diversity of CMRO2 and CBF responses to functional activation across different cortical functional areas, cortical layers, and microvasculature types in healthy-aging mouse, and (3) to quantify the effects of standard fMRI calibrations (e.g. hypercapnia, hyperoxia, and caffeine) on the CMRO2 and CBF at rest and during functional activation. The research design and methods that will be used in this project will include (1) developing faster and deeper chronic imaging of absolute oxygen concentration to assess relation between cortical pO2, CMRO2, and blood flow changes during brain activation across the cortical areas and layers, and (2) realistic measurements of the oxygenation, blood flow, and metabolism responses to functional activation at the microvascular scales in healthy-aging mice and in response to calibration procedures that are commonly used in BOLD fMRI imaging. The research environment of Dr. Sencan (the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and Radiology Department in Harvard Medical School) is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies required to execute the proposed project and is rich with opportunities for training in neuroscience, career development, and interdisciplinary collaborations. She has a team of mentors, collaborators and advisors with diverse and strong expertise, who are committed to support Dr. Sencan’s research, and her career development. All these factors will facilitate the successful execution of the proposed project, the completion of Dr. Sencan’s training in neuroimaging, and her transition to an independent tenure-track faculty position."

This NIH F30 application describes a four-year plan for mentored research and career development for the PI,
Matthew Cheung. The scientific premise of this proposal is focused on the role of kidney resident macrophages
and their responses to acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a major complication affecting up to 20% of hospitalized
and 60% of critically ill patients. Despite the high mortality rate and frequency of occurrence, targeted therapies
to treat AKI have not been successfully developed. The innate immune system, particularly macrophages, are
important in the pathogenesis and healing in AKI and will likely be an important component of future therapies.
Studies involving kidney resident macrophages (KRMs) are increasing in number as preliminary studies suggest
that they are crucial in renal homeostasis and healing from injury. KRMs modulate the response to AKI, but the
mechanism of their contribution remains unknown. Here, we will elucidate the molecular and cellular
mechanisms that govern how KRMs maintain and restore renal function after injury. Our preliminary single-cell
RNA sequencing data suggest that the KRM population consists of several undescribed subpopulations with
distinct functions. Spatial transcriptomics shows that these subpopulations reside in distinct microenvironments
and at least one appears to migrate to the proximal tubules in response to injury. We have also found that KRMs
in both mice and humans express high levels of the complement protein and pattern recognition molecule C1q.
Our central hypothesis is KRM subpopulations have a defined transcriptional response to renal injury and react
to PTEC damage in a C1q-dependent manner. We will test this hypothesis through single-cell and spatial
transcriptomics and a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including the use of mice deficient in C1q
expression in KRMs and a model of proximal tubule-specific injury. Understanding the involvement of the various
KRM subpopulations and of C1q, one of the most abundant proteins produced by KRMs, will have a significant
impact on our understanding of mechanisms that can be targeted for the treatment of AKI. The proposed training
plan for the PI is sponsored by co-mentors Anupam Agarwal, MD, and James George, PhD. Included in the
training plan are experiences that will help Matthew develop in three major areas: 1) rigorous immunological
research in acute kidney injury, which includes developing familiarity with the existing literature, critical evaluation
of data, and training in the responsible conduct of research; 2) rigorous training in advanced bioinformatics and
next-generation sequencing analysis and 3) career and professional development, including grant and
manuscript writing, scientific communications, and the translation of research findings to clinical applications.
This proposal drives the development of skills required for rigorous scientific research critical immunology and
advanced bioinformatics skills necessary for the PI’s future career as a nephrology physician-scientist focused
on precision medicine and immune-mediated kidney diseases."

Cancer metastasis, which accounts for 8 million deaths worldwide annually, is a multistep process that includes
the emergence of metastatic subclones in primary tumors, dissemination and survival in circulation, seeding and
colonization at distant sites. Deciphering the evolutionary dynamics, the spatial context, and the molecular nature
of each step during metastasis is critical to understanding this lethal phase of tumor evolution, and to potentially
develop effective therapeutic strategies. However, it remains challenging to directly study these events due to
their stochastic and rare occurrence over long time frames, diverse interactions within the microenvironment,
and transient shifts in cellular plasticity. Among the most highly metastatic and lethal cancer types, small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer with a median survival of only 7– 12 months,
which has not improved over the past 30 years. Despite its clinical importance, SCLC metastasis remains
underexplored due to the paucity of clinical metastatic samples, which raised several fundamental questions:
what is the origin and evolutionary dynamics of SCLC metastases? Whether and how does the microenvironment
contribute to metastasis? Whether and how key intermediate cell states influence evolutionary fate decisions?
Our overarching goal is to elucidate the cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis,
and ultimately develop a comprehensive, spatiotemporally-resolved roadmap of SCLC metastasis using a
genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC. To achieve this goal, we will develop a suite of cutting-edge
technologies that will overcome substantial technical hurdles that have thus far precluded progress, and will
allow us to establish a comprehensive, spatiotemporally-resolved lineage tracing platform capable of recording
the entire course of SCLC metastasis. Specifically, we will 1) map the evolutionary dynamics and trajectories of
SCLC metastasis by the generation and analysis of an evolving lineage tracing mouse model of SCLC, 2) dissect
the spatial context and cellular composition of the pro-metastatic niche by creating a high resolution spatial-
lineage platform, and 3) investigate transient cell state changes during metastasis through signal recording. Our
systematic effort will culminate in the generation of a comprehensive blueprint of SCLC metastatic progression.
This blueprint will integrate the evolutionary dynamics, the spatial and microenvironmental context, and the
molecular features and gene expression dynamics underlying SCLC metastasis, offering significant insights for
future functional dissection and therapeutic development. The technical advances and biological discoveries
generated here will transform our conceptual understanding of cancer metastasis, create cutting-edge
technologies for dissecting the mechanisms of tumor evolution, and potentially reveal novel ways for
stage/gene/environment-specific therapeutic strategies to limit SCLC metastatic spread and target metastases,
and therefore is ideal for the DP2 mechanism. More broadly, our work will create a general platform for studying
the progression of many cancer types, enabling a holistic understanding of tumor evolution."

Acute febrile illness (AFI) is an important cause of morbidity and productivity loss in Latin America.
Despite efforts for surveillance and advancements in diagnostic capacity, the etiology of AFI is still
unknown in over 50% of cases. Our Project of Febrile Illness Surveillance in the Andean and Amazon
Countries (“PISAAC”) proposes to study AFI etiology and epidemiology, to strengthen the core public
health systems that prevent and mount prompt containing responses in front of outbreaks.
PISAAC, led by Dr. Eduardo Gotuzzo at Universidad Cayetano Heredia, is a multi institutional
initiative developed in close collaboration with key actors and institutions at the Peruvian Ministry of
Health (MoH), including the Peruvian National Health Institute (INS). This initiative will be carried out
in partnership with the National Institute of Health Leopoldo Izquieta Perez (INSPI) and Escuela
Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL), in Ecuador, aiming to develop a coordinated effort to
establish a systematic surveillance system within the Coastal, Andean and Amazon regions of South
America. Additional key partners include U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit Nº6, and the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
Our specific aims are to determine the etiology and epidemiology of acute undifferentiated febrile
illness in strategically selected regions of Peru and Ecuador, improve laboratory capacity for the
diagnosis of illness, produce timely and accurate surveillance data, and develop a workforce that can
continue with these measures. Additionally, we aim to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial
resistance, and the etiology and antimicrobial resistance of acute diarrheal disease.
The study will start in two regions in Peru during the first year. Subsequently, during the second year,
two regions in Ecuador will be added, and 1 to 2 new regions per country will be added per year. The
initial stage is a prospective study of sentinel surveillance that will enroll subjects that present to
healthcare centers of primary and secondary care level with AFIs. Blood and serum samples will be
taken at acute presentation for PCR based tests and serology. Additionally, urine and nasal samples
will be collected and stored along with serum alliquotes in a biorepository for future studies.
Convalescent sera will be collected for paired serology testing in those patients that resulted negative
for initial testing with molecular methods. During the second year, components of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) surveillance and diarrheal disease surveillance will be implemented, as these two
health problems are considered public health priorities for Peru.
PISAAC is in a unique position to strengthen the national surveillance and emergency response
systems as it builds upon the pre-existing infrastructure and public health delivery platforms, provides
strategic complementary partnerships across lab diagnosis to disease control and addresses the core
technical areas demanded by the Global Health Security Agenda."

Chronic pain caused by injury to the peripheral or central nervous system (neuropathic pain) is
notoriously resistant to treatment, while the mechanisms that drive and/or maintain chronic pain remain
unclear. We have shown that chronic nociceptor hyperexcitability after severe injury is maintained by
cAMP signaling through multiple cAMP effectors, including PKA, EPAC and HCN channels. These
pathways are enhanced by AKAP-mediated complex formation with AC and show significant cross-talk
with Ras/MAPK signaling. Activation of cAMP- and Ras-mediated pathways initiate at the plasma
membrane (PM) and are uniquely sensitive to clustering of lipids within the PM. We have also shown
that spinal cord injury reduces AC inhibition by Gαi, resulting in reduced potency of opioids in DRG
neurons. This reduced sensitivity can be mimicked in DRG neurons from naïve animals by overnight
exposure to neurotrophic factors or by a 5 min, modest depolarization that approaches the firing
threshold of DRG neurons after severe injury. Importantly, nociceptor hyperexcitability and reductions
in opioid potency, induced by either injury, neurotrophic factors or acute depolarization, can be
reversed by inhibition of Ras-dependent signaling or reorganization of lipids in the plasma membrane.
We hypothesize that the sustained depolarization that occurs in many injury models drives alterations
in PM lipid organization, leading to increased ERK signaling and decreased opioid responses. Release
of neurotrophic factors reinforce these pathways and, in conjunction with cAMP signaling, drives
nociceptor hyperexcitability and a chronic pain state. To address these hypotheses, we propose three
Aims. 1) Determine the mechanism for reduced MOR-Gαi inhibition of AC by C-Raf, 2) Define the
mechanism of Ras activation and nociceptor hyperexcitability by depolarization and SCI, and 3) Define
functional consequences of interactions among depolarization and cell signaling by cAMP, C-Raf, and
ERK. Importantly, our model identifies multiple FDA-approved drugs that could simultaneously enhance
endogenous opioid responses and block nociceptor hyperexcitability after severe injury."

power of the limb muscles) limits exercise performance in people with Pre-D. Our laboratory demonstrated that
(1) across the diabetic spectrum, people with Pre-D and T2D have greater fatigability of limb muscles than
controls due to mechanisms within the muscle, and (2) fatigability in people with T2D was associated with a
reduced blood flow to the exercising muscle. It is unknown, however, if people with Pre-D have impaired vascular
function and oxygen delivery that leads to an increased fatigability. Our central hypothesis is that impaired
vascular function impedes blood flow and blunts subsequent oxygen delivery to skeletal muscle during exercise,
resulting in excessive fatigability of limb muscles in people with Pre-D. A unique and translational aspect of this
proposal is the quantification of the vascular responses (macro- and micro-vasculature) to fatiguing exercise and
exercising training at different sites along the vascular tree, including, in feed arteries (doppler ultrasonography),
isolated skeletal muscle arterioles (extracted from muscle biopsy), capillary perfusion (near infrared
spectroscopy, NIRS) and capillary density (from muscle biopsies). Aim 1 will determine if vascular dysfunction
is a mechanism for excessive fatigability in people with Pre-D. Aim 1.1 will compare leg blood flow and skeletal
muscle oxygenation in response to dynamic fatiguing exercise between people with Pre-D, healthy controls and
T2D. Groups will be matched for age, sex, body mass index and physical activity levels to determine disease-
related vascular function and fatigability rather than inactivity-related changes across the diabetic spectrum.
Skeletal muscle blood flow through the femoral artery will be quantified with ultrasonography and skeletal muscle
oxygenation with NIRS during a dynamic fatiguing knee extension exercise. Aim 1.2 will determine endothelial
vascular function at macro- and micro-vascular levels in people with Pre-D and T2D. Flow-mediated dilation will
be assessed in vivo in the femoral artery using ultrasonography and in isolated arterioles extracted from the
vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. Aim 2 is a clinical trial that will determine the effectiveness of resistance
exercise training coupled with blood flow restriction to improve fatigability and vascular function in people with
diabetes. People with Pre-D and T2D will perform 8 weeks of unilateral resistance training in which one leg is
exercised with freely perfused conditions and the other leg with blood flow restriction. Thus, blood flow restriction
and resistance training will be used as a probe to further understand the mechanisms of fatigability along the
vascular tree in people with Pre-D and T2D, and test training strategies to improve fatigability in this population."
10912654,"Corneal transplantation is the most commonly performed allografting procedure in the world—nearly 40,000
cases in the United States and over 200,000 globally are performed each year. As surgical techniques, eye
banking procedures and prophylactic measures against graft rejection have improved, the field has also
become more sensitized to the quality of the donor tissue, including donor factors that can impact long-term
graft survival. In this regard, and in the context of the global `epidemic' of diabetes which affects over 10% of
the American population (over 30 million people), there are increasing reports that the diabetic status of donors
can adversely impact corneal graft survival. While the diabetic state in graft recipients, which is associated with
delayed healing and prolonged inflammation, has long been identified as a risk factor for transplant longevity,
the concept that a history of diabetes in the tissue donor can also impact graft survival is both novel and
potentially highly impactful from an eye banking and tissue selection standpoint. This would mean that
corneal transplant risk stratification would include the donor diabetic state in the decision algorithm for tissue
allocation. To investigate the potential role of the donor diabetic state on graft immunity, we began preliminary
studies in a mouse model of diabetes to assess how it would affect the resident immune cells of the cornea,
which could impact host sensitization and alloimmunity. Our preliminary data show that (1) there are more
matured corneal resident antigen-presenting cells (APC) in diabetic mice, (2) both penetrating and lamellar
(DSEK) allografts procured from diabetic donor mice have significantly worse survival than those procured
from non-diabetic donors, (3) hosts receiving diabetic tissue show heightened T helper-1 (Th1) immunity to
donor-derived antigens. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that (4) glycemic control in diabetics
decreases MHC-II expression by corneal APC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the diabetic state induces
an altered corneal microenvironment that alters the immune homeostasis of the cornea, inducing APC
maturation and regulatory T cell dysfyunction, that lead to heightened host sensitization and graft
rejection. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will define the degree of
change in corneal APC functional phenotype in diabetic mice and assess the alloimmune response in hosts
receiving diabetic donor tissue (PK and DSEK). We will then investigate the mechanisms by which graft-
derived APC from diabetic donors impact host allosensitization (Aim 2) and regulatory T cell (Treg) dysfunction
(Aim 3). This grant, which represents a new area of investigation, is anchored in the core expertise of our lab,
which has studied corneal transplant immunity for more than 25 years. Knowledge gained from this grant holds
the potential to impact eye banking and tissue allocation as well as open new translational venues such as
manipulating donor tissue APC maturation/activation ex vivo, improving transplant outcomes and reducing the
risk of donor tissue shortages as a result of excluding all diabetic tissues."
10912570,"Candidate: My long-term career goal is to reduce the cognitive, physical, and emotional morbidity following pe-
diatric concussion by implementing early interventions to those at highest risk for persistent post-concussion
symptoms (PPCS). With 75% of my time dedicated to patient-oriented research and career development, my
short-term goals are to develop a predictive model to most accurately identify those patients at highest risk of
developing PPCS, and to use a novel mobile health (mHealth) intervention to improve specialist access from
the emergency department (ED) setting. This proposal builds on my prior work in researching objective mark-
ers of dysfunction following concussion, and will position me to gain skills in advanced predictive modeling to
facilitate early risk stratification, utilizing advanced mHealth-based interventions to facilitate care continuity and
positioning such interventions for adoption and sustainability, and designing and leading clinical trials from the
ED setting that utilize innovative methods to create the evidence base for mHealth intervention adoption.
Environment: This proposal leverages the substantial resources available to me at Children’s Hospital of Phila-
delphia, through the Division of Emergency Medicine, Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Innovation
Ecosystem, and Sports Medicine and Performance Center; at The University of Pennsylvania, through the
Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, The Penn Injury Science Center, and the Leonard Davis In-
stitute of Health Economics; and through the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. The men-
tored research experience and formal didactic training, in addition to the clinical experience of practicing in a
quaternary care pediatric ED, create an ideal environment for my ongoing career development.
Research: Concussions are prevalent injuries in the pediatric population. While the majority of symptoms in
concussed youth resolve within 1 month, a significant proportion (30%) experience symptoms lasting months
to even years. Several observational studies have identified risk factors associated with PPCS, however the
best current methods to risk stratify concussed youth do so with only moderate discrimination, and are heavily
reliant on subjective symptoms. In addition, while traditionally, pediatric concussions were managed with pas-
sive rest, more recently, active therapies have become the standard of care in the specialty setting. However,
the traditional referral model presents several barriers to care continuity and specialist access for ED concus-
sion patients. Novel mHealth interventions have the potential to improve care continuity, serving as a bridge
between care settings for concussed youth. In order to facilitate improved care and ultimately reduce symptom
burden to highest risk children, this proposal aims to: (1) Improve accuracy of concussion risk stratification
from the ED using physiologic markers of injury; and (2) Assess the feasibility of a mHealth tool to facilitate
specialist access and care continuity. Study results will allow me to develop a R01 proposal of a clinical trial
evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth-facilitated targeted referral to reduce the incidence of PPCS."
10909679,"Stress-related psychiatric disorders (SRPDs) are now the leading disease burden worldwide and
diagnoses are increasing in both adolescents and adults. High rates of trauma in the US, especially for women
and marginalized racial, ethnic, and sexual minority groups, ensures continued high rates and health
disparities in SRPDs. Provided the biological complexity, symptom heterogeneity, and high comorbidity of
these disorders, the search for biomarkers has been difficult. Additionally, current gold-standards for clinical
research entails comparing a clinical group to a control group. However, this design is less than ideal for
SRPDs as the risk factors (genetic and environmental), potential biomarkers, and collection of symptoms are
on a continuous spectrum; not a dichotomy like other conditions. Biologically, and statistically, SRPD
biomarkers and symptoms should be treated as continuous variables. The last couple decades have produced
convincing evidence regarding the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) on the epigenome and
brain structure in regions regulating stress, mood, reward, and cognition - the very pillars of SRPD symptom
clusters. An individual’s ACE history, genome, epigenome, and brain metrics should be used in combination to
reveal biocomposites of SRPDs. The objective of this New Innovator Award is to test my newly developed
model, The GEAN Model of mental health (Genetics, Epigenetics, ACE, and Neurobiology) designed to identify
SRPD biocomposite clusters based on continuous individual-level endophenotypes to better understand risk
and heterogeneity SRPDs. Using advanced computational approaches, we will 1) identify epigenetic sites and
brain regions most responsive to the environment, 2) identify genetic and endophenotype clusters that mediate
the relationship between ACE history and SRPD symptoms in a prospective cohort, and 3) validate this same
model in a separate clinical cohort. This project is innovative because it is truly transdisciplinary and bridges
the fields of psychiatry /psychology, (epi)genomics, and neuroscience with powerful computational models to
address the biological underpinnings of SRPDs. The proposed studies directly tackle many of the issues
around the sheer complexity of SRPDs by integrating trauma and multiple biological measures, using a
multidimensional phenotype measure, and using person-centered analyses in both prospective and clinical
cohorts. Importantly, these studies address the challenge of diversity by employing state-of-art mobile imaging
methods for at-home data collection. Further, by including a genetically informed design, we specifically tackle
the challenges of genetic-confounding. The results of these studies represent major acceleration within the
field of mental health and will inform better predictions of long-term outcomes following ACEs, biocomposites of
SRPD risk and diagnoses, and treatment targets for precision medicine. We anticipate that the results will
create a new paradigm for SRPDs and inform research and clinical care for years to come."
10913396,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed study is to understand how cells accurately deliver and insert an
essential class of membrane proteins known as tail-anchored proteins (TAs) into the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) membrane. TAs participate in a wide range of important cellular functions including
vesicle transport, regulation of apoptosis, and protein quality control. While it is critical for their
functions that newly synthesized TAs are localized to appropriate membranes, the details of how
cells achieve this spatial organization is not clearly understood. To fill this current knowledge gap,
the study proposed here aims to dissect the molecular mechanism of the `Guided Entry of Tail-
anchored proteins' (GET) pathway, which guides newly synthesized TAs to the ER membrane.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to visualize and understand the major molecular event of
the GET pathway. This will be achieved by utilizing cryo-electron microscopy to obtain snapshots
of key protein complexes in action, and by complementary protein-protein interaction and TA-
insertion studies. More specifically, this study will investigate how the `pre-targeting complex' of
the GET pathway captures and commits newly synthesized TAs to the ER-bound path, and once
at the ER membrane how the Get1/2 insertase complex inserts TAs into the lipid-bilayer. Together,
these multi-disciplinary approaches will enhance our understanding of how cells achieve accuracy
and fidelity of TA-targeting, which is essential not only for TA functions but also for maintaining
functional ER membrane. Furthermore, these studies will provide valuable insight into various
human diseases such as diabetes, cancer and congenital heart disease that have been linked to
defective GET pathway."
10913289,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is rapidly becoming the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the U.S. The genetic landscape of PDAC shows prevalent mutations of KRAS; however, expression
of mutant KRAS (KRASmt) alone at the adult stage is insufficient to drive PDAC, suggesting that a second hit is
required. KRASmt was previously regarded as an oncogene and thought to be fully active, yet recent studies
have shown that an endogenous level of KRASmt is not fully active. Rather, it can be hyperactivated by pancreatic
cancer risk factors, including pancreatitis and obesogenic high-fat diet challenge, which act as the second hit to
promote PDAC with high penetrance. However, the molecular mediator linking these risk factors to KRASmt
hyperactivation remains elusive. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are major enzymes activated by KRASmt for the
generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in cancer. Notably, our preliminary data have shown
that inhibition of NOX suppresses KRASmt activation, indicating that NOX is not only a downstream effector but
also a potential upstream regulator of KRASmt. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that pancreatic
cancer risk factors, including pancreatitis and chronic high-fat diet consumption, facilitate the formation of a
sustained NOX and KRASmt co-activation partnership, which leads to full-blown PDAC. Targeted inhibition of
NOX breaks the partnership promoted by these risk factors, thus hampering pancreatic tumorigenesis. To test
this hypothesis, we will employ novel inducible genetically engineered mouse models expressing endogenous
levels of KRASG12D with ablation of NOX docking subunit p22phox in pancreatic acinar cells and expose the mice
to inflammatory stimuli or obesogenic high-fat diet. Similarly, mutant p53 also facilitates the NOX-KRASG12D co-
activation partnership to promote aggressive PDAC. We will ablate p22phox in pancreatic acinar cells of the
mice expressing both KrasG12D/+ and p53R172H/+. The objective of this proposal is to determine if NOX is the bona
fide critical molecular mediator linking these pancreatic cancer risk factors to KRASmt hyperactivation, which
drives pancreatic neoplastic progression, a fundamental unanswered question in the pancreatic cancer field. If
proven, this study will delineate the molecular underpinnings and cellular events of the synergistic cooperation
among oncogenic KRAS, NOX, and pancreatic cancer risk factors, and will provide insights into novel preventive
and therapeutic strategies against this devastating disease in humans."
10913523,"Project Summary
With few exceptions, the enzymes that catalyze Nature’s most challenging and important reactions all require
metal ions for activity. Among the most important of these metals in organisms from bacteria to humans are iron
and manganese: nearly all organisms require iron for growth, and the few that do not require iron depend on
manganese instead. Cells carefully regulate the concentrations of the metal ions that they require through a
complex network of uptake proteins, export proteins, trafficking proteins, and protein- and RNA-based regulatory
systems. The proper function of all of these systems are essential to avoid potentially deleterious chemistry of
the “free” metal ions as well as inactivation of enzymes resulting from incorporation of incorrect metal ions. As a
result, mismanagement of the cellular free concentrations of iron and manganese has been connected with a
number of human diseases, in particular neurodegeneration. On the other hand, the ability of a host organism
(a human being) to disrupt metal management in an invading pathogen correlates with reduction of the virulence
of that pathogen. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of iron and manganese
homeostasis in bacteria and humans has the potential to lead to new approaches to treat these diseases. An
important approach to study metal homeostasis involves design and application of metal-selective fluorescent
sensors – consisting of either small molecules, proteins, or nucleic acids – which are able to report on
concentration, localization, and dynamics of the metal ions within cells. Fluorescent sensors for metals such as
calcium and zinc have revolutionized our understanding of the biology of these ions. Unfortunately, few tools
exist to study iron and manganese within cells, a reflection of the inherent challenges associated with selectively
detecting an analyte that tends to bind weakly in biological systems. This research proposal outlines a
comprehensive program to develop selective fluorescent sensors for iron and manganese, using Nature’s
platforms for selective metal recognition, in order to probe novel mechanisms of metal regulation in bacteria and
in eukaryotic cells. The proposal uses detailed biochemical analysis of metal recognition by iron- and
manganese-binding proteins and nucleic acids to rationally design new sensors. These sensors are then
deployed to provide insight into outstanding questions in the field, such as the mechanism and consequences of
iron overload in pathogenic bacteria, as well as characterization of intracellular manganese trafficking systems
in yeast and human cells. These answers will not only increase our understanding of fundamental mechanisms
of selective metal recognition in biological systems but also potentially uncover new avenues for therapeutic
intervention."

Abstract
HSV1 and HSV2 recurrences typically result in skin lesions but may also cause blindness, sacral meningitis, or
life-threatening encephalitis. Stress is known to be one of the primary triggers for HSV recurrent disease, although
surprisingly little is known about how it does so. Although most studies have focused on viral latency in sensory
neurons of either the trigeminal ganglia or lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia, HSV also establishes latency in
autonomic neurons, which innervate the face and genitals very differently, are highly responsive to known
reactivation stimuli, and likely contribute to differential pathogenesis of HSV1 and HSV2. Our preliminary studies
demonstrate that the sympathetic pathways, which are one branch of the autonomic nervous system, have a
significant impact on the severity of HSV1 acute disease symptoms and contribute to 74% of HSV1 and 49% of
HSV2 recurrences in vivo. Stress hormones, regulated by the autonomic nervous system, modulate different
types of neurons through glucocorticoid and adrenergic receptors, which are expressed in different patterns on
sensory and autonomic neurons in which HSV1 and HSV2 establish latency. The short-term stress hormone
epinephrine induces HSV1 reactivation, but not HSV2, and this only occurs in sympathetic neurons. In contrast,
corticosterone (the rodent form of cortisol, the long-term stress hormone) induces reactivation of both HSV1 and
HSV2. However, corticosterone cause HSV1 to reactivate only in sympathetic neurons, but causes HSV2 to
reactivate in both sympathetic and sensory neurons. We have identified the receptors through which epinephrine
and corticosterone induce reactivation and have substantial preliminary data suggesting specific signaling
pathways and proteins that are involved in the process of reactivation. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that stress hormones selectively regulate HSV1 and HSV2 infections in autonomic neurons, leading to
differential reactivation and recurrence frequencies of HSV1 and HSV2. Using primary adult neuronal cultures
and the guinea pig infection model, we will 1) identify the signaling pathways through which epinephrine
selectively induces HSV1 reactivation from primary adult sympathetic neurons, and 2) identify the signaling
pathways through which corticosterone (CORT) selectively induces HSV1 and HSV2 reactivation from primary
adult sensory and sympathetic neurons. The proposed research is expected to challenge the paradigm of HSV
reactivation by demonstrating that maintenance of latency and the process of reactivation are not “one size fits all,”
and that autonomic neurons are an important source of HSV recurrent disease. Our studies will show that different
mechanisms cause reactivation of HSV1 and HSV2 in different types of neurons. The work also has far-reaching
implications for understanding how sensory and autonomic neurons differentially respond to viral infections, in
general."

 Integrated transcriptional regulatory circuits govern gene expression programs at the right place and
right time. Mutations in transcription factors contribute to tumorigenesis. Despite the accumulation of
transcription factor profiling, how different transcription factors co-regulate gene expression remains poorly
studied. The research gap leads to the poor resolving power for polygenic conditions, especially cancer. In
addition, the regulation network changes among different cells. In order to systematically and accurately
dissect the transcriptional regulation network in normal tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis, efforts must be
made to firstly generate genetic models based on the genome-wide association study (GWAS) from human
patients, secondly using advantageous single cell techniques to investigate the regulation of multiple
transcription factors at chromatin, transcription and posttranscription levels in single cells.
 For F99 phase of the proposed research, Chi Zhang will continue working on the transcriptional
regulation network of tissue stem cell quiescence, immune privilege and long-term maintenance of stem cell
function. Through genetic knockout of two transcription factors individually and combinatorially in different
cell lineages at different stages, Chi spatiotemporally investigated the functional role in vivo. The established
single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Cut&Run ChIP-seq also allow Chi to dissect out the regulation network of
Foxc1 and Nfatc1 at molecular level, including promoter enhancer looping, transcription factor binding, open
chromatin dynamics, super enhancer identities, etc. Then using the established multiphoton system, Chi would
be able to visualize the cellular activity of tissue stem cells after genetic manipulation.
 For K00 phase of the proposed research, Chi will apply the methodology in the context of glioblastoma.
Considering it as one of the most progressive cancer with life expectancy of 14 to 16 month and existing GWAS
data indicating the mutation of multiple transcription factors in human patients. Using the established
glioblastoma mouse model in Dr. Parada lab, Chi will try to uncover the transcription regulation network of
cancer stem cell, cancer heterogeneity and immune privilege.
 At the technical level, the use of genetically engineered mouse models, sophisticated genomic tools
including scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq and live imaging should establish a blueprint for others to link
transcriptional mechanisms to stem cell activities in live animals."

Ocular pain and photophobia are common and debilitating conditions associated with migraine and dry eye
disease (DED). Persistent pain, dry eye, and/or photophobia are also experienced by nearly 40% of patients
who have received refractive surgery. A common neuroanatomical substrate in migraine, DED, and refractive
surgery is the trigeminal nerve, specifically the ophthalmic branch, which is involved in reflex homeostatic
regulation of the cornea and dura. It is well known that damage to these reflex circuits leads to overt
sensations of pain, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and effective non-opioid treatments
are lacking. We hypothesize that the trigeminal neurons projecting to the cornea and dura are modulated by
feedback from light-sensing cells in the eye, as well as by interaction with infiltrating immune cells leading to
dysregulation of the reflex pathways and amplification of sensory responses – causing hypersensitivities to
touch and light (photophobia). We will test this hypothesis in rodent models of migraine, DED, and refractive
surgery by identifying molecular mechanisms and neural pathways common to the three pain models, using
neuroanatomical, physiological, and behavioral approaches. Experiments will include investigation of potential
therapeutic targets, including CGRP, TRPM3, and melanopsin, all of which have been previously implicated in
photophobia. These studies will elucidate key cellular and molecular changes underlying the development of
ocular pain and photophobia in migraine, DED, and refractive surgery, and will guide therapeutic development."

10914179,"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have produced unprecedented results in blood cancers, but clinical responses in solid tumors are rare due to the detrimental effects of the hostile, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the use of patient derived, dysfunctional T cells adversely affected by advanced disease state and previous chemotherapy. Invariant Natural Killer T cells (iNKTs) are a distinct lineage of CD1d-restricted T lymphocytes with natural tissue (and tumor) tropism, direct cytolytic effect on CD1d+ cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages and adjuvant effects on endogenous anti-tumor immunity. Unlike conventional T cells, allogeneic iNKTs mediate a robust graft-versus tumor effect without inducing graft-versus-host disease, thus eliminating the need for gene editing to maintain tolerance. Moreover, preclinical studies in mouse models suggest that CAR-enhanced iNKTs can eradicate solid and solid-like hematological tumors where CAR-T cells fail. We hypothesize that allogeneic CAR-engineered iNKTs will overcome the barriers to successful CAR-therapy and provide a powerful off-the-shelf universal platform with curative potential for solid tumors. Yet, unsolved questions related to allo CAR-iNKT safety, optimal preconditioning regimens to promote persistence, cell dose and therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors remain. Furthermore, while healthy human donors for allogeneic iNKT clinical trials are randomly selected, cells generated from different donors have different immunomodulatory capacities that may affect their engraftment and survival and it is currently unknown which products are “best” for adoptive cell therapy (ACT). These questions cannot be adequately addressed in mice due to the dissimilarity between murine and human iNKT cells. In contrast, our preliminary studies demonstrate that canine and human iNKT cells share remarkable phenotypic and functional similarities and can be CAR engineered and expanded to clinical scale for trial use. Here we will use immunocompetent pet dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma (OSA), which is remarkably similar to pediatric OSA, to advance allogeneic IL-13Rα2-targeting CAR-iNKT cells into the human clinic. We will first characterize CAR-iNKT cells from different donor dogs and generate a master cell bank of canine alloCAR-iNKT products with different immunomodulatory capacities. Next, we will address the safety and effects of 3 strategically designed pre-conditioning regimens, including a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapies, low dose total body irradiation and a clinical grade iNKT glycolipid agonist, RGI-2001, on allo-CAR-iNKT engraftment and persistence in dogs with metastatic OSA. Finally, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose of alloCAR-iNKT cells using an accelerated dose escalation trial design and evaluate their effects on the TME, systemic immunome and disease free interval in dogs with appendicular OSA. This work addresses pivotal questions for the advancement of allogeneic-CAR-iNKT cells in a clinically relevant canine cancer “model” to accelerate clinical use of this promising “off the shelf” approach in human patients with solid tumors."
10914181,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lipids are a vital class of molecules that play countless important and varied roles in biological processes. Fully
understanding lipid roles, however, is difficult since the number and diversity of lipid species is immense with
cells expressing tens of thousands of diverse lipid species. While recent advances in chromatography and high-
resolution mass spectrometry have greatly improved our understanding of the potential lipid species present in
many different sample types, effectively separating the numerous lipids still remains problematic due to the many
isomeric lipids. Isomeric lipid species such as those resulting from subclass isomers, distinct acyl chains
connectivity (sn-1, sn-2, or sn-3), different double bond positions and orientations (cis or trans), and unique
functional group stereochemistry (R versus S) have made lipid characterization especially difficult due to many
having the exact same mass. To address this challenge, ion mobility spectrometry separations, ion-molecule
reactions and fragmentation techniques have increasingly been added to lipid analysis workflows to allow both
species separation and improved characterization. However, currently these analyses are still not able to fully
assess the number of lipid species present in complex lipid mixtures or provide an in-depth analysis of molecular
differences based on their spatial position in tissues and organs. Furthermore, when several analytical
techniques are utilized separately, experimental and data analysis times are greatly extended, making largescale
evaluations difficult or impossible. The overall objective of this research is to develop a new analytical platform
and corresponding data analysis and visualization methods to increase the coverage, throughput and spatial
assessment of lipidomic analyses. The use of a combinatorial approach of analytical methods including
traditional chromatographic methods, chiral separations, automated solid phase extractions (SPE), gas phase
chemical derivatizations, multiplexed ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) separations and
automated data analysis will provide unprecedented coverage for the numerous lipid isomers and species
present in complex samples. This highly specific and sensitive, automated platform will then be applied to the
targeted quantification of various lipid species in largescale tissue screening analyses to assess over a 1000
lipidomic samples per day."
10914689,"Thrombocytopenia absent radius (TAR) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that causes absence of
the radii, reduced numbers of mature megakaryocytes (MKs), and thrombocytopenia. TAR is caused by
mutations in the RBMBA gene, resulting in reduced mRNA expression of RBMBA and levels of its encoded
protein, Y14, in patient platelets. Since Y14 has no known roles in MK biology, it is currently not understood
how deficiencies in this protein contributes to a MK phenotype without affecting other hematopoietic lineages.
Previous studies of Y14 depletion have identified a role for Y14 in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, but it is
unclear whether this is the mechanism responsible. Both the postnatal emergence of the thrombocytopenia in
TAR and the known differences in MKs derived from primitive or definitive progenitor cells suggest that
definitive MKs may present a more severe phenotype and thus be a more insightful model. By modeling this
disease in vitro using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and isogenic corrected lines, we
can assess the effects of TAR on pure cell populations to observe lineage- and developmental stage-specific
changes without influence from the compensatory feedback mechanisms that regulate blood cell generation in
vivo. Overall, we hypothesize that Y14 depletion in TAR syndrome impairs maturation of definitive MKs more
severely than primitive MKs through altered cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, and it does not affect the
development of other blood lineages. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine the specific characteristics of MKs
that is altered due to Y14 depletion during primitive and definitive differentiation. Aim 1A will evaluate aspects
of MK maturation and functionality to determine the specific MK phenotype, and Aim 1 B will determine if
reduced Y14 alters apoptosis and cell cycle progression in MKs as a potential mechanism for this phenotype.
Using RNA-seq, we will detect differential expression of genes related to these pathways or identify any novel
targets with the potential to contribute to the MK defect. Aim 2 will address the MK specificity of TAR by
comparing consequences of Y14 depletion in MK differentiation to erythroid and myeloid differentiations. Aim
2A will discern whether the hematopoietic lineages regulate Y14 RNA or protein levels differently. Aim 28 will
use cell proliferation and lineage-specific surface marker expression to detect potential defects in erythroid or
myeloid development. We will also determine whether cell cycle and apoptosis regulation are altered in these
other lineages as well as any additional pathways that are identified in Aim 1 B. This will be the first study to
directly compare the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and MK maturation during primitive and definitive
hematopoiesis and test whether these models have the potential for divergent disease phenotypes. The results
of this study will not only elucidate the mechanism of TAR syndrome in MKs, but its insight into MK biology at
different stages of development will have important implications for improving current in vitro disease models
and tailoring therapeutics to distinct tissue systems to reduce human disease."

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is
upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely
with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs,
and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore
motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less
effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal
is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings
of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered
orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool
that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and
then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG
datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to
provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to
determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is
innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices.
These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously
promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple
effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on
society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for
stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life."

10914086,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For too long, studies of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) have ignored the blood component of this interface,
focusing almost exclusively on the cells of the Neurovascular Unit (NVU). The goal of the FOA to which we are
responding aims to change this:
 “The intent of this FOA is to stimulate the development of a new field of blood-based science by re-defining
 the neurovascular unit as a component of the blood-brain interface. This will facilitate development of human-
 based neurovascular-blood models to identify targets for diagnostics and regulation of the blood-brain
interface…”
The NVU is comprised of endothelial cells (EC), pericytes and astrocytes, and a complex basement membrane,
which work together to severely limit the free movement of molecules from the blood into the brain parenchyma.
In response to local signals during development BBB EC develop tight junctions and have very low rates of
transcytosis. The side-effect of this is that access of potentially therapeutic drugs into the brain is also
compromised. In this proposal we will build on our well-established human Vascularized Micro-Organ (VMO)
platform to create a novel blood-brain interface model, the VMO-B. In this model a network of human
microvessels anastomoses to microfluidic channels representing an artery and a vein and are induced to a BBB
phenotype by Wnt signaling. The vessels are invested by pericytes and contacted by astrocyte foot-processes.
Importantly, we will run a blood substitute – VMOBlood – through the vessels that will mimic the composition of
blood, including protein and lipid content. We will then use the VMO-B to investigate the process of BBB
breakdown in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease. We already have preliminary data suggesting that
expression of mutant HTT protein in EC causes BBB deficits. We will investigate crosstalk between blood and
the cells of the NVU, and how expression of mHTT in each cell type affects cell-cell communication and barrier
function. In the R61 phase we will pursue three aims: Aim 1 Develop a stable MPS BBB model with perfused
microvasculature; Aim 2 Incorporate flow of blood into BBB microfluidic model; and, Aim 3 Characterize key
transporters at the blood-brain interface. In the R33 phase we will use this platform to examine the role of the
blood-brain interface in the pathology of HD through an additional two aims: Aim 4 Test the hypothesis that
expression of mHTT in EC disrupts transport across the BBB leading to changes in the neural micro-environment;
and, Aim 5 Test the hypothesis that expression of mHTT disrupts multiple cell-to-cell interactions at the blood-
brain interface. Completion of this project will not only shed light on the neuropathology of Huntington’s
disease, but will also yield a platform ideally suited to drug development and investigating the role of the blood-
brain interface in numerous neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s
disease, stroke, CADASIL, and traumatic brain injury."
10914292,"People with serious mental illness (SMI) comprise 5% of the US population and experience one of the largest
CVD-related mortality disparities of any group with rates 2 times higher, and dying 10-20 years earlier, than the
overall US population. Underpinning this wide disparity is marked elevation in prevalence of all CVD risk
factors in persons with SMI, with low rates of risk factor control. Interventions addressing CVD risk factors
require tailoring for persons with SMI who often have substantial barriers related to psychiatric symptoms and
cognitive impairment. There is an urgent need for scale-up of efficacious interventions shown to address the
high burden of multiple CVD risk factors in SMI, however, organizational and provider-level barriers impede
implementation. To improve care of persons with SMI and overcome fragmentation of the US general medical
and specialty mental health systems, behavioral health homes, programs where specialty mental health
organizations are responsible for coordinating primary care services, have proliferated. While they have shown
improved access to primary care and screening for CVD risk factors, to-date behavioral health homes have not
resulted in improvement in CVD risk factors, likely because they are not implementing evidence-based
interventions. Two effective interventions, the NHLBI-funded IDEAL and NIMH-funded Life Goals interventions,
have been shown to reduce CVD risk in persons with SMI. The overarching goal of this UG3/UH3 is to partner
with communities in Michigan and Maryland serving persons with SMI to refine, tailor and test provision of
different implementation strategies to improve uptake of these evidenced-based practices for reducing CVD
risk in SMI in behavioral health homes. Replicating Effective Programs (REP) Framework components (e.g.,
community working group, packaging, training, technical support) will lay the groundwork for uptake and
sustainment, alongside two additional implementation strategies, Coaching and Facilitation, which address
provider and organizational barriers, respectively. The Specific Aims are to (1) Establish a highly collaborative
and productive partnership with 24 Michigan and Maryland community mental health program sites to tailor
IDEAL/Life Goals evidence-based practices and implementation strategies to fit site needs; (2) Determine
effectiveness of two implementation strategy augmentations to REP, Coaching and Facilitation, on a) uptake
and delivery of IDEAL/Life Goals at 18-months (primary outcome), and b) quality of care for CVD risk factors
and CVD risk factors among persons with SMI, (secondary outcomes) and (3) To assess mechanisms (e.g.,
provider self-efficacy), moderators (e.g., implementation climate), and other relevant measures (e.g., fidelity,
costs) to inform an adaptive implementation intervention to further scale up IDEAL/Life Goals in the behavioral
health home setting. This innovative work will inform which combination of implementation strategies will lead
to optimal uptake of effective interventions to reduce CVD risk among persons with SMI in community-based
settings, a critical step in reducing their CVD disparities and achieving health equity."

 Mammalian genomes is folded within the nucleus in a highly organized fashion.
The cohesin complex participates in the organization of 3D genome through generating
and maintaining DNA loops. The tumor suppressor STAG2, which encodes a core subunit
of the cohesin complex, is frequently mutated in various cancers. However, the impact of
STAG2 inactivation on 3D genome organization in cancer cells, especially the long-range
enhancer-promoter contacts and subsequent gene expression control, remains poorly
understood. In our preliminary studies, we have carried out RNA-seq, ChIP-seq as well as
Hi-C analyses in melanoma cells stably expressing inducible shRNA of STAG2. We have
shown that depletion of STAG2 in melanoma cells leads to expansion of topologically
associated domains (TADs) at sites where binding of STAG2 is switched to its paralog
STAG1. We also identified Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) as a putative direct target
of STAG2 in melanoma cells and demonstrated that loss of STAG2 activates IRF9 to
enhance type I interferon signaling and increases the expression of PD-L1. Based on
these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that loss of STAG2 results in dysregulation of
type I interferon signaling in melanoma via perturbation of 3D genome organization. In aim
1, we will characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of type I
interferon response by STAG2 in melanoma via modulating 3D genome organization. We
will also examine the chromatin interactions at the IRF9 locus and other targets in STAG2
wildtype and STAG2 mutant human melanoma samples. In aim 2, we will systematically
characterize STAG2-specific chromatin loops and investigate the effects of STAG2
inactivation on the enhancer-promoter interactome in melanoma cells by carrying out
STAG2- and H3K27ac- HiChIP analyses. In aim 3, we will examine the roles of STAG2 in
regulating tumor-induced immune evasion and in determining the sensitivity to anti-PD-1
immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma. Findings from the proposed study will very
likely reveal functions of STAG2 within the cohesin complex that contribute to the
malignant phenotypes in STAG2 mutant cancer arising from 3D genome perturbation."

The Problem. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for 45% of all
deaths. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is now understood to be a multi-system disease process involving not only
the cardiovascular system but also the renal, neuroendocrine and immune systems. No effective therapy is
currently available to treat the most severe subset of CHF patients that have progressed to acute
decompensated HF. An innovative approach to reduce the cardio-depressant effects associated with the
chronic inflammatory state of CHF may provide a breakthrough for this disorder. This proposal will evaluate
the safety and probable benefit to improve cardiac or renal function with an immunomodulatory device to
bridge patients to Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) implantation deemed ineligible for this life sustaining
procedure. If the trial is successful, a pathway to commercialization via a Humanitarian Device Exemption
(HDE) would be available for rapid use in this patient population whose life expectancy is days to weeks.
The Product. The Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) is an immuno-regulating, extracorporeal, membrane
device targeted to modulate the cardio-depressant effects that are associated with CHF. SCD is a platform
technology focused on immunomodulation of acute and chronic inflammation associated with acute and
chronic organ dysfunction. SCD membranes selectively sequester activated systemic leukocytes as they flow
through the cartridge via an extracorporeal circuit. Pre-clinical results show SCD treatment results in a 25%
improvement in ejection fraction in a canine CHF model. Innovation. SCD is an innovative approach to treat
CHF. Rather than utilizing small molecules to improve myocardial contractility, SCD acts as an
immunomodulatory device to dampen the cardio-depressant effects of the chronic pro-inflammatory state of
CHF. This proposal will provide the first clinical support for the use of immunomodulatory treatment for
chronically inflamed CHF patients. Phase Il Hypothesis. SCD treatment will demonstrate safety and probable
benefit as a bridge to LVAD implantation in a previously ineligible CHF patient population. This Phase Il plan is
based upon results demonstrating SCD treatment improved cardiac contractility in a canine model of CHF and
an ongoing clinical trial demonstrating first in human, proof of concept of successful bridge to LVAD in an
ineligible patient with severe CHF with improvement of cardiac performance. Aim. To expand a current single
center IDE clinical trial to a multicenter trial to enroll 20 patients in 4 centers for evaluation of safety and
probable benefit of SCD treatment for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for a severely ill
patient population to bridge to a life sustaining LVAD implantation. Commercial Opportunity. This proposed
single clinical trial which demonstrates safety and probable benefit will support a HDE submission for FDA
approval and commercialization."
10917675,"Project Summary/Abstract
Somatic mutations alter the folding and therewith function of oncogene and tumor suppressor proteins. The
alterations in protein structure drive malignant transformation of cells. While structural changes of somatic
mutated proteins have been extensively characterized with high spatial resolution, conformational alterations of
other nonmutated effector proteins in the cancer proteome remain elusive. The heterogeneity of protein
conformations and protein-protein interactions in tumors at the single cell level remains unknown, and it is unclear
whether tumor cells with the same genetic background differ in protein conformation or protein-protein
interactions in non-mutated proteins.
Here, we propose to implement a new mass spectrometry-based protein footprinting technique to measure
protein conformations in single cells. We recently developed Covalent Protein Painting which infers protein
structural information with a chemical protein footprinting technique that surveys the chemical reactivity of lysine
residues in proteins to determine alterations in protein conformation or protein-protein interactions in a
proteome. We propose new versions of CPP that will overcome the current limitations in sample preparation
and analysis of single cell proteomes (CPP-SCP). We will quantify lysine site accessibility in single cells with
CPP-SCP, and we will establish bioTMT-CPP-SCP, a variation of the CPP-SCP method that can directly
compare changes in the 3D proteome between several (>10) single cells with high sensitivity. We propose to
analyze intact single cells that are isolated from two cancer cell lines and from murine tumor tissues. Our goal
is to find out whether measurements at single cell level recapitulate structural alterations that we observed in
bulk tumor samples. Specifically, it remains unclear whether aberrant protein conformations per protein are
observed at equal abundance across all cells or if they are confined to a subset of cells in a cancer cell line or
tumor. We hope that CPP-SCP will allow us to differentiate between intra- and intercellular variation in protein
conformation and folding."
10918010,"Abstract: Saf-T-Drape: Sterile Drapery Shielding for Radiological Scanners
Current drapery solutions for MRI, CT, and PET scanners are inconvenient to install, prone to failure during use,
and can impede image-guided procedures. Our new Saf-T-Drape shielding will have an impact in 3 areas:
minimally invasive image-guided surgery; mitigation of Hospital Acquired Infection (HAI), and increased
efficiency for diagnostic radiology. To date, the number of procedures requiring a sterile field in the scanner has
been relatively small, and practitioners have largely overlooked the inconvenience. However, the number of
image-guided neurosurgical procedures is growing, and improved drapery is one of several improvements that
could significantly reduce the barriers for more widespread adoption. Furthermore, Hospital Acquired Infection
(HAI) is a large and growing problem. About one in 31 hospitalized patients has at least one HAI, with rates up
significantly since 2020, according to the CDC, which reports direct medical costs of HAIs >$28.4B annually.
Recent large increases in rates for Candida auris and Clostridioides difficile highlight the need for mitigating
surface-based infection sources. HAI have profound implications for affected patients, as well as adversely
affecting hospitals’ financial and reputational standing. A 2017 study found that 4% of patients passing through
an Emergency Room CT scanner contracted a HAI associated with that scanner. The International Society for
Infectious Disease recommends use of a disposable plastic barrier changed between each patient as a best
practice for preventing infectious in the radiology department. No commercially available drapery product makes
implementing this practice feasible. Scanner cleaning following a highly infectious patient takes 20-30 minutes,
but total down time can be much longer, since facilities frequently wait for 30-120 minutes for the specially trained
cleaning team. Since MRI and CT scanners typically generate $3k-$6k per hour, even a 15 minute interruption
can be very expensive. Simple measures to greatly reduce or eliminate scanner downtime can be extremely
cost-effective. Scanner down-time translates directly into lost revenue, and the absence of an important
diagnostic tool. Saf-T-Drape was created in response to a neurosurgeon’s complaints about the ad-hoc nature
of current drapery solutions, which included the difficulty and time to install, frequent sagging enough to interfere
with visibility and equipment, and easily becoming dislodged, especially by larger patients. We conceived the
Saf-T-Drape concept of a semi-rigid liner for the scanner bore that is easily installed, easily disposed, economical
for single-patient use, robust against patient movement, and does not interfere with procedures. A patent has
been applied for Saf-T-Drape’s novel fastening mechanism, which does not interfere with the scanner bed
movement. We propose several straight-forward measurements to characterize Saf-T-Drape, which will assure
potential collaborators and investors that it is safe, it does not degrade image quality, it is compatible with current
MRI and CT scanners, and is likely to be effective in mitigating transmission of infectious diseases."
10917679,"Technical Abstract
 Neurodegenerative disorders affect over 40 million people worldwide and most, if not all, are mediated by
inflammation. Even though several drugs have recently been approved by the FDA for treating neurological
disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), their efficacy as AD therapeutics has not been realized as extremely
low levels of the drug reach the brain. The goal of this Phase I project is to develop an effective targeted delivery
system for siRNA against NFκB expression (siNFκB) to mitigate neuroinflammatory diseases. We have recently
shown that siRNA entrapped in bovine colostrum-derived exosomes and polyethyleneimine matrix (EPM) can
effectively deliver siRNA to reduce target gene expression. We will apply our extensive experience in exosomes,
siRNA therapeutics and inflammatory responses for efficient, targeted delivery of siNFκB to the microenvironment
of the brain where progressive increase in inflammation ultimately leads to manifestation of neuroinflammatory
diseases including AD. We hypothesize that EPM-siNFκB formulations administered via a novel trans-spinal (t.s.)
route can effectively deliver siNFκB to the brain and knockdown the inflammatory regulator NFκB and attenuate
corresponding disease markers. We also hypothesize that use of smaller exosomes (smExo) (average size 45
nm) coupled with folic acid (FA)-functionalization can enhance the brain delivery presumably due to more efficient
crossing of the blood brain barrier and high expression of folate receptor-α (FRα) in the brain, respectively. Our
hypotheses are supported by high siRNA entrapment (>90%) in the EPM, protection of EPM-siRNA from
enzymatic degradation, higher knockdown of NFκB in murine cells than conventional reagents, higher brain
accumulation of smEPM-siRNA in mice treated via t.s. route compared with the traditional routes, intravenously
and intranasally, and FA-functionalization of exosomes for brain targeting. Innovation in this project lies in the use
of bovine colostrum powder - an abundant and cost-effective source of native exosomes, use of smaller exosomes
and FA-functionalization coupled with t.s. administration. Investigators experienced in exosomes, drug delivery,
siRNA therapeutics and animal models, leveraging extensive experience of Dr. Robert Friedland in AD research,
will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Optimize delivery of siNFκB using FA-functionalized exosomal
vector in vitro and in vivo. Murine cell lines bearing WT sequences of NFκB will be used to identify effective siNFκB
sequences based on NFκB knockdown. Aim 2. In vivo efficacy of brain-targeted FA-smEPM-siNFκB. The lead
formulation from Aim 1 will be tested for efficacy in murine models of AD. Therapeutic benefit will be based on
knockdown of NFκB in the target (cortex and hippocampus) and non-target tissues, related histopathological and
AD biomarker changes, and assessment of behavioral endpoints. This project will provide proof-of-principle for
inhibition of neuroinflammation by targeted t.s. delivery of siNFκB. In Phase II, we will compare inhibition of other
targets such as BACE1, a key target for AD, alone and in combination with NFκB using multiple rodent AD models
to identify the optimal gene target(s) for this disease."
10922736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Enzymes are the primary functional molecules in cells, providing enormous rate enhancements,
specificity and regulation to the diverse chemical reactions that are necessary for life. Enzymes, like all biological
macromolecules, are the products of evolution: all enzymes have evolved to operate within the complex
environment of the organism/cell in specific environmental niches(s). Thus, an understanding of enzyme function
and evolution is fundamental to biology. Enzymes also have tremendous potential in medicine (e.g., as targets
for anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral drugs and as therapeutics for metabolic disorders) and in industry (e.g.
to make important commodity chemicals and as catalysts for bioremediation). Our central premise is that a
quantitative, mechanistic understanding of enzyme function and its relationship to organism fitness is critically
needed to precisely manipulate enzymes and to deeply understand biology.
 To generate this level of understanding, we need: (1) a quantitative, chemical, and physical knowledge
of enzyme function, and (2) mechanistic data describing how and when these physical principles contribute to
enzyme function within the complex environments where enzymes operate. An enhanced understanding of the
relationships between protein sequence, protein function and cellular/organismal fitness will have profound
impacts across biology and medicine, from improving our ability to predict how mutations will influence the
virulence and drug susceptibility of human pathogens, to enhancing precision medicine by accurately predicting
the consequences of allelic variants, to enabling the design of next-generation protein and cellular therapeutics.
Achieving this understanding requires new tools and a new conceptual paradigm. Enzymes are highly
interconnected, their functions are multifaceted, and their cellular environments are complex. Traditional
biochemistry is enormously powerful, allowing for the intensive study of a few individual enzymes in vitro (10s)
and providing detailed knowledge of their chemical mechanisms. But identifying the many residues that matter
for enzyme function requires investigation of residues beyond the active site at a scale far beyond that of
traditional biochemistry. Furthermore, this biochemical information then needs to be translated to organism
fitness in vivo in a quantitative manner. Here we will overcome these challenges. We will first use evolutionary
sequence information to direct enzyme variant design towards functionally important areas of sequence space.
We will adapt high-throughput microfluidic technologies to quantitively measure the biochemical properties (e.g.,
kcat, Km, Ki, and ∆GFold) of this library of 104 enzyme variants in vitro (Aim 1). Then we will determine how each
of these variants affects organismal fitness in vivo using pooled competition and barcode sequencing assays
(Aim 2). Finally, we will use this sequence-function-fitness map to test long-standing models in biochemistry and
evolution and reveal the biochemical determinants of fitness important for industry and medicine (Aim 3). Such
a comprehensive and quantitative mapping of biochemical function to fitness has never been achieved."

The journey from health research to patient-centered solutions, especially in the realm of neural engineering
and neurotechnology, presents numerous challenges. These span from the intricacies of clinical requirements
to the complexities of regulatory landscapes. Moreover, traditional academia doesn't always prepare students
for the commercial aspects of their innovations. Addressing this need is the Cleveland NeuroDesign
Entrepreneurs Workshop (CNEW). Modeled after Stanford's Biodesign framework, CNEW equips
neurotechnology researchers and entrepreneurs with the skills needed to transform their scientific concepts
into viable commercial solutions. Hosted annually at Case Western Reserve University, the workshop gathers a
select cohort of 32 participants. These attendees, grouped into teams, embark on a journey from identifying
clinical needs to presenting a business pitch. The program offers a rich blend of lectures, real-world case
studies, and mentorship, culminating in a pitch competition evaluated by industry experts. Having conducted
four iterations, CNEW has established its effectiveness in fostering entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Aim 1) and
promoting long-term professional growth in the neurotechnology sector (Aim 2). The workshop's track record
showcases its role in transforming participants into adept professionals, ready to innovate in the field of
neurotechnology. For the upcoming 5th iteration in September 2024, we are seeking partial funds via this R13
application. Our institution is fully supportive, with recurrent faculty involvement. Aiming to widen our impact,
we are amplifying our outreach to underrepresented STEM communities, ensuring a more diverse and
inclusive participation."
10908369,"Project Summary
The goal of the proposed project is to investigate functional and structural brain networks that predict disruptive
behavior in children. Disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) affect over 113 million youths worldwide and are
characterized by irritability/anger, aggression, noncompliance, and/or antisocial behavior. These disorders are
of great interest because they are highly predictive of delinquency, criminality, and substance abuse in later
adolescence and adulthood. DBD also co-occur in over 50% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A
large body of evidence links DBD with perturbations in frontoparietal circuitry that support the cognitive control
of emotion (i.e., emotion regulation), particularly connections between regions of the dorsal and ventral prefrontal
cortex (d/vPFC) and amygdala. However, it is unclear if dysregulation in emotion regulation circuitry can
contribute to a biomarker of DBD in children with and without ASD. With a focus on the amygdala-d/vPFC circuit,
this study will be the first to examine disruptions in brain-wide connectivity and structure in emotion regulation
networks as a transdiagnostic biomarker of DBD and disruptive behavior problems more broadly in children.
First, we will develop and test a multimodal imaging biomarker of DBD in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development study dataset, which contains clinical and fMRI data for 11,878 9-12 year olds in the first and
second releases. Next, we will test the hypothesized disruptions in emotion regulation circuitry using a fMRI task
of cognitive reappraisal in a new, transdiagnostic sample of children with disruptive behavior with and without
ASD. This study will leverage cutting-edge neuroimaging analytics that resonate with several NIMH research
priorities: network neuroscience or connectomics, multimodal imaging, computational modeling (machine
learning), big data analytics, and the RDoC domain of cognitive control. The proposed research will push forward
the development of brain-based biomarkers of disruptive behavior that could guide development of targeted
interventions, refinement of existing treatments, or identify children likely to respond to a particular treatment.
The proposed project will prepare Dr. Karim Ibrahim to become an independent clinical researcher with a unique
niche and expertise in transdiagnostic brain biomarkers of emotion regulation in childhood-onset psychiatric
disorders using connectomics, multimodal imaging, and predictive modeling approaches. To accomplish this,
the proposed training will provide Dr. Karim Ibrahim with multidisciplinary training in network
neuroscience/connectomics, machine learning/predictive modeling, biostatistical approaches for the analysis of
large imaging datasets, and emotion regulation circuitry. The training and research are enhanced by the
intellectually rigorous environment at the Yale Child Study Center and Department of Psychology. The
mentorship of a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in fMRI, connectomics, and child
psychopathology ensures achievement of the research and training aims."
10908371,"Kidney transplantation (KT) is the best treatment for kidney failure; however, due to the shortage of
organs, most KT candidates must wait years—sometimes over a decade--to receive a transplant. Kidney
failure causes muscle wasting. So while waiting and persevering with dialysis treatments, KT candidates
lose muscle and thus physical function. By the time they undergo transplantation, 47% of KT candidates
have trouble walking, balancing, and/or getting out of a chair. These losses lead to poor post-transplant
outcomes, longer wait times, or even waitlist removal. Such outcomes are devastating for both patients
and transplant centers, and sadly are not rare. Furthermore, such events excessively impact persons of
Black, Hispanic, or Asian heritage, who are more likely to develop kidney failure. We know what reverses
these losses—exercise. Ideally, transplant centers would proactively prescribe a pre-transplant exercise
program. But uptake of exercise interventions into KT candidate care remains minimal. This is because we
continue to have a knowledge gap about what is the most effective way to deliver an exercise intervention
to KT candidates. Patients have stated they prefer a home-based exercise intervention, as this format
overcomes the barrier of the dialysis schedule. Yet prior home-based interventions have been limited by
low adherence, reducing impact of the intervention. Supervision by an instructor can increase adherence
by adding the element of accountability. But most home-based interventions have been unsupervised due
to cost. With the adoption of virtually delivered health care, a new option has emerged: virtually supervised
home-based exercise interventions. Using a virtual meeting platform, persons can exercise while being
supervised by an instructor online. For KT candidates, who cope with the intense time and travel
requirements of dialysis, virtually supervised exercise may be the best option to efficiently and effectively
improve their physical function. Our goal is an effective and scalable exercise intervention that can be
used by transplant centers to prevent the loss of physical function in KT candidates. We have
developed an innovative clinic for KT candidates who are within two years of likely transplant, ideal for
instilling health behavior change. Leveraging this clinic, we will conduct a 24-week randomized controlled
trial in 80 KT candidates to evaluate the impact of a virtually supervised home-based exercise intervention
using a delayed intervention design. Participants will initially receive virtually supervised exercise or health
education for 12 weeks, which will be the primary endpoint. At the end of the initial 12-week period, we will
evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical function (Aim 1), depressive symptoms, and fatigue
(Aim 2). Both arms will then receive the exercise intervention in the second 12 weeks to assess adherence
and acceptability (Aim 3). Our end product will be an intervention that can be used widely to improve the
physical function of KT candidates, sustaining their hope and wish for a future free of kidney failure."
10908302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Lysosome-Related Organelles (LROs) contain both lysosomal proteins and cell-type specific proteins
in an acidic lumen. They are enlarged in Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) patients resulting from
either excessive fusion or inhibition of their fission. The mutated gene in CHS encodes the lysosomal
trafficking regulator (LYST) protein, whose function is poorly understood. Defects in microtubule
behavior and centrosome behavior are seen at the immunological synapse of CHS patients but whether
microtubule nucleation is affected directly in CHS cells is controversial.
 To determine LYST's function in LROs and clarify its requirements at microtubules, we will use a
Drosophila model in which mutants of the LYST counterpart, encoded by the mauve (mv) gene, show
enlarged LROs (yolk granules) and microtubule defects in mitosis and in maintaining nuclei at the
correct position in the embryo. Mauve co-immunoprecipitates from Drosophila embryos with factors
involved in maturation of endosomes; a factor enabling dissociation of the SNARE complex from
mature vesicles; Dynein/Dynactin, which have roles in vesicle trafficking and at microtubules; and
several centrosome-associated molecules. Thus, this stage of Drosophila development is highly
amenable to study the role of LYST/Mauve in the biogenesis of LROs and at microtubules and
centrosomes.
 To establish the role of the Mauve/LYST complex in regulating LRO size and trafficking, we will follow yolk
granule biogenesis in wild-type and mv-mutant females; determine the effects of constitutively active and
dominant-negative forms of the enodcytotic regulators Rab5, Rab7 and NSF1. To discover the role of
Mauve/LYST complex in regulating microtubule dynamics, we will determine microtubule defects in mv-
derived embryos and establish the genetic interactions between mv and genes for microtubule associated
proteins with which it associates and physical interactions between these gene products. By determining
how Mauve directs the centrosomal association of Minispindles protein; how together with Rab5 and Dynein,
it promotes accumulation of microtubule associated proteins at the centrosome; and how Mauve's partner
proteins participate in recruitment of microtubule organizing molecules at centrosomes we will uncover how
vesicle trafficking associated proteins can participate in promoting centrosomal maturation.
 We anticipate that this will define the dual role of Mauve/LYST in regulating vesicle fission/fusion and
in the trafficking of proteins important for microtubule nucleation and centrosome maturation. We
anticipate our findings will translate to human cells where they will have potential to unlock doors for the
development of therapeutic agents to treat the immunological defects of CHS patients."

assisted Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Goalspace has the potential to have a major impact on autism
treatment worldwide by increasing the amount of parent engagement in ABA therapy. Demand for ABA
services far exceeds capacity. Parent-assisted ABA is a key evidence-based component of ABA. While they
cannot be expected to replace professionals in delivering treatment, parents can be directed by the child’s
Behavior Analyst to provide additional opportunities outside of the therapy sessions to collect behavior data
and practice skills being acquired. However, parent-assisted ABA is challenging to achieve in high fidelity.
Research shows that even with significant training, parents frequently digress from protocol, and paper forms
are not completed in a timely fashion. Current electronic ABA data collection systems hold promise but are
designed for professional Behavior Technicians and are not suited for use by non-professionals. Parents
require inherently different user interfaces and engagement models than professionals. Goalspace represents
a new type of engagement platform that will allow Behavior Analysts to efficiently support these divergent types
of users, while still providing full control over the intervention protocols, content, and workflow. Goalspace will
automatically generate parent-facing versions of programs designed for Behavior Technicians, converting
complex instruments and protocols into streamlined versions suitable for parents, and deliver alert-driven
guided intervention protocols to parents’ mobile phones."

as the Associate Director of the Flow and Image Cytometry Shared Resource (FICSR) of the
Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (Roswell Park). This position was created in 2007
to oversee the research applications of the various imaging (confocal, live cell imaging) and flow
cytometry platforms available in the facility and to apply his extensive experience in these areas
in collaborations and consultations with the FICSR investigator user base. With over 35 years of
experience in clinical and research applications of flow and image cytometry (30 years at Roswell
Park), Dr Minderman throughout his career has collaborated with many investigators at the
Cancer Center on NIH funded projects. The FICSR is an integral part of Roswell Park’s Cancer
Center Support grant (P30CA016056) for which the cancer center Director, Dr Johnson serves
as the Principal Investigator. The Tumor Immunology & Immunotherapy (TII) CCSG program,
previously co-led by the Unit Director on the original application, Dr Odunsi, is the major user
base of the FICSR; but numerous NIH-funded researchers across all 5 CCSG programs actively
collaborate and consult with Dr Minderman commensurate with the purpose of the PAR 21-286
funding opportunity. During his first R50 tenure (2016-2021), Dr Minderman’s contributions to
Roswell Parks research enterprise have been significant and impactful specifically with regards
to the NIH-funded research. As of October 2021, 137 extramural grant applications dependent
on FICSR were awarded to Roswell Park faculty, 59 were awarded by NIH, 22 of which to
members of the TII program. The cancer center has also made significant investments in the
FICSR with the acquisition of a new confocal microscope, two spectral flow cytometry analyzers
and a 3rd Fortessa analyzer. With the changes in the R50 program now making the distinction
between Laboratory (PAR-20-288)- and Core (PAR-20-287)-based scientists and with the FICSR
being an integral part of the Roswell Park CCSG infrastructure, Dr Johnson as the PI of the
CCSG grant, will now serve as the Unit Director for the renewal application."
10917627,"Project Summary (Project 1)
Oxytocin is a neuropeptide important for social behavior, such as maternal care, pair bonding, and cooperation
by partners and groups. Direct axonal oxytocin release into various forebrain targets is critical for social behavior,
but it remains unclear if the oxytocin system is heterogeneous and reflects important functional differences for
certain cell subsets, relates to inter-animal differences in parental abilities, and if experience-dependent plasticity
can adapt the oxytocin system to social and parental environments. Oxytocin administration might also be
clinically promising for autism spectrum disorders, social anxiety, and post-partum conditions. However, it is
imperative to understand what aspects of oxytocin release relate to parenting, cooperating, and communal living,
and whether there are differences in oxytocin modulation that depend on sex, experience, or social context.
 Here we will address this critical knowledge gap. Recently, with the U19 Behavior Core we built a system
for neural recordings and behavioral monitoring, continuously collecting data over days to months on home cage
life as mice parent or co-parent together. This was combined with photo-tagged recordings in vivo of identified
oxytocin neurons in maternal mice. Our documentary-style video recordings revealed previously-undescribed
behavioral interactions by which experienced mothers seemed to encourage or perhaps ‘teach’ co-housed pup-
naïve virgin females to engage in maternal care. These behaviors activated photo-tagged oxytocin cells in virgin
PVN, providing a robust foundation for the current Project, in which our team aims to understand what aspects
of maternal care- by single mothers, pairs, and small groups- activate oxytocin neurons, require oxytocin
signaling, and might produce or depend on plasticity of this system upon transition to parenting. The central
hypothesis is that the oxytocin system is attuned to social variables related to pup care and the behavior of other
potential co-parents, to regulate the behavior of single and co-parents to assure pup survival. We further
hypothesize that this depends on adult dominance interactions (studied with Project 2 and analyzed with the
Computational Modeling Core) that set up social structures for effective co-parenting. We will monitor oxytocin
neurons with in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, photometry, and perform behavioral and opto-/chemo-genetic
studies in adult mice to determine when and how oxytocin modulates neural circuits for social information
processing and reliable maternal behavior, with mechanisms of modulation informed by Project 3 and relevant
brain areas for social information processing identified in Projects 2 and 4. In Aim 1 we study initial plasticity of
oxytocin cells when animals become single mothers, relating oxytocin cell firing to variables such nest building
or pup temperature. In Aim 2, we ask if oxytocin neurons help experienced dams teach co-housed naive adults
to co-parent. In Aim 3, we study groups of 3-4 mice (including an experienced dam and litter) to quantify dynamics
of communal living and co-parenting, and how oxytocin helps ensure social network stability for raising infants."
10918152,"Project 3
The principal goal of Project 3 is to better link the behaviors of zebrafish to underlying synaptic circuitry. In both the
central and peripheral nervous systems we will leverage recent advances in high throughput serial section electron
microscopy to acquire high resolution image data and then use new machine learning approaches to analyze this data. This
effort will use three kinds of approaches: 1) sparse manual reconstructions of particular pathways related to particular
behaviors, 2) dense reconstruction of synaptic connections to reveal all the input and output of neurons that is spatially
correlated to markers that show excitatory and inhibitory cell types and activity, and 3) saturated reconstructions that also
provide glial, vascular, sensory end organs and muscle (cardiac, skeletal and smooth).
The zebrafish is the only vertebrate animal where obtaining a saturated reconstruction of the entire nervous system is
conceivable. The connectomic data will be used initially to test the validity of published models of how a behavior is
instantiated in the nervous system. In the likely event that there is some difference between what was expected based on
published models and what is found, these data will be used to help formulate new models. Second, the data will be used
to reveal previously unknown pathways, such as those that interconnect the autonomic and somatic nervous systems.
Finally we will build the necessary infrastructure so the data can be used as a public, freely addressable atlas for any
researcher who has interest in tracking the long and short range neural pathways that underlie vertebrate behavior at the
resolution of single synapses."
10916845,"Summary:
Although cognitive dysfunction is a frequent and debilitating symptom of traumatic brain injury (TBI), there are
currently no effective treatments available for this often persistent deficit. The neurophysiological basis for these
symptoms are unclear, as are the relative contributions of focal/diffuse pathologies in moderate/severe TBI. We
have developed and characterized two large animal (pig) models of focal brain injury with a diffuse component.
New advances in high-density electrophysiology are finally able to reveal how neuronal coding of memory is
altered by TBI, however it is unknown how this process is differentially affected in biomechanically accurate
translational animal models of focal/diffuse brain injury. Without a mechanistic understanding of how coding that
underlies cognition and memory is disrupted post injury, rational design of neuromodulatory and other therapies
remains challenging. Therefore, a critical need exists to determine the underlying mechanisms of the disruption
of memory encoding in cognitive networks TBI, and whether and how theta neuromodulation can restore function
in these models. In additional, the structural basis for these changes must be identified using advanced imaging
techniques validated by neuropathology. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms whereby TBI leads to the disruption of memory and recall in limbic networks, and to develop novel
treatment strategies to improve memory and cognitive function. The overall objective of the current application
is to determine how the coding of memory in the hippocampus and associated circuitry is disrupted following TBI
in a gyrencephalic brain, the structural basis for this dysfunction, and whether and how theta neuromodulation
restores function. Our central hypothesis is that focal TBI disrupts communication within the extended
hippocampal network via axonal injury, disrupting oscillatory interactions required for encoding and recall of
memory in networks of synchronized neuronal ensembles. Furthermore, fronto-parietal CCI (CCI-FP) will disrupt
specific pathways between structures while leaving local circuitry intact, leading to loss of entrainment to HC
oscillations in PFC, whereas occipito-temporal (CCI-OT) will have direct effects on HC circuitry that propogate
to PFC. We will therefore first determine whether TBI affects phase amplitude coupling, phase precession, theta
sequences and replay in area CA1 of the hippocampus during tasks designed for these measures. In addition,
we will determine the mechanism of learning and memory dysfunction following TBI by examining neuronal
ensemble activity across HC-PFC, quantifying ripple features and replay, and correlating these measures with
complex behavioral function relying on these networks. We will then examine whether and how neuromodulation
restores spatial/working memory in pigs via simultaneous fimbria-fornix (FF) stimulation and high-density laminar
hippocampal/mPFC recordings during behavior. Advanced neuroimaging, both in vivo and ex vivo, will be
validated by neuropathology, and correlated with the behavioral and electrophysiological measures.
Accomplishment of these goals will provide the first detailed analysis of disrupted neuronal coding and oscillatory
interactions between brain regions during memory tasks in gyrencephalic TBI models. These experiments will
also identify the effects of neuromodulation on these networks and their functional restoration, leading to crucial
mechanisms that can be translated in the future to clinical treatments for this persistent sequelae of TBI in our
Veterans."
10917946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
From eukaryotes to prokaryotes, proper protein folding is essential to cellular function. Disulfide bond formation
contributes to the overall protein folding process, stabilizing structures and protecting against degradation.
Disulfide bond-forming machines that facilitate proper protein folding are well recognized in eukaryotes and
Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, a major disulfide bond-forming pathway has only recently been identified in
the Gram-positive Actinobacteria Actinomyces oris, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Corynebacterium
matruchotii. In these organisms, a membrane-bound thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase named MdbA catalyzes post-
translocational folding of exported proteins. Importantly, genetic disruption of mdbA abrogates assembly of
adhesive pili and biofilm formation, alters cell morphology, and attenuates bacterial virulence. Nonetheless, how
actinobacterial cells cope with stress and protein misfolding is not well understood. To address this fundamental
question, we began to analyze the proteomes of Actinobacteria and found that most PBPs harbor 2 or more
cysteines; intriguingly, deletion of pbp1A or pbp1B in C. diphtheriae resulted in a cell morphology defect that
mirrors that of mdbA mutations. With a genetic approach, we then screened for viable suppressor mutants when
C. diphtheriae mdbA mutant cells grown at non-permissive temperatures. Serendipitously, we discovered
another thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, which we named TsdA (tsd for temperature-sensitive dsb-forming).
Preliminary studies reveal that TsdA contains a thioredoxin-like fold found in MdbA, suggesting that TsdA may
serve as a specialized disulfide bond-forming machine to encounter cell stress. Finally, we identified a potential
protein disulfide bond isomerase that may serve as a safeguarding system to rescue misfolded proteins. As we
continue employing A. oris and C. diphtheriae as experimental models in this renewal application, by using a
multidisciplinary approach that combines genetics, biochemical and biofilm assays, and crystallography, we aim
to examine the molecular coupling between oxidative protein folding and cell wall biosynthesis in Actinobacteria,
to elucidate the mechanism of oxidative protein folding mediated by a compensatory thiol-oxidoreductase
machine in response to stress, and to elucidate a pathway for protein disulfide bond isomerization in
Actinobacteria.

10915020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in the availability of behavioral outcome measures that are appropriate, reliable,
and valid for use with children with Down syndrome (DS). Lack of such outcome measures represents an
important problem to identifying behavioral concerns, measuring treatment effects, and interpreting clinical
trials aimed at improving the lives of individuals with DS. Without evidence-based behavioral outcome
measures, interventions and treatment trials in this population will remain suboptimal due to poor study
measures. Working groups convened by NICHD of leading experts in DS identified that no measure of
behavioral concerns was evaluated as appropriate or validated for use with individuals with DS. The overall
objective of this application is to develop and validate a novel measure of behavioral concerns, the Behavior
Inventory for Down Syndrome (BIDS), that can be used in research, clinical practice, and treatment studies
focused on children and adolescents with DS ages 2-17 years, in both English and Spanish. Our rationale for
working with this population is that DS is associated with a distinct neurobehavioral phenotype, yet key
behaviors of concern common in individuals with DS are omitted from currently available measures of
behavioral concerns. Thus, proposed items on the BIDS will incorporate behavioral concerns raised by families
and in clinical practice related to children with DS. We propose three specific aims: 1) demonstrate the
psychometric properties of the BIDS among children and adolescents with DS in English and Spanish by
identifying the BIDS measurement model, establishing reliability (test-retest and inter-rater reliability) and
validity (internal and construct validity) 2) evaluating differences in the measure’s psychometric properties as a
function of variation in selected demographic and clinical characteristics, and 3) characterize the trajectory of
the BIDS over time among children and adolescents with DS to provide comparative data for clinical trials. To
achieve these aims, we will conduct online, phone, and paper surveys in English and Spanish, and in-person
assessments in English or with Spanish-speaking interpreters, targeting children ages 2-17 years with DS. Our
research team is uniquely positioned to conduct this work, combining expertise in DS, measure
development/evaluation, Latinx populations, psychological assessment, and comorbid medical conditions. We
anticipate that this measurement study will provide critical guidance for future efficacy and effectiveness trials.
Our goals are in line with the INCLUDE Project research priority to expand inclusion of individuals with DS in
clinical trials by developing appropriate measures of behavior for this population. As our field continues to
develop new pharmaceutical and clinical interventions, our project will support this work and have an impact on
the 400,000 individuals with DS living in the United States."
10915674,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The clinical success of androgen receptor signaling inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide has
significantly extended survival for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but metastatic CRPC
tumors inevitably acquire resistance to these agents through a variety of mechanisms. Of particular concern,
due to the increased aggressiveness and lethality, is the development of lineage plasticity: when the tumor
transitions from a classical, androgen receptor (AR)-positive, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing
adenocarcinoma to an AR-low/negative, PSA-low tumor with undifferentiated or neuroendocrine/small cell
histology. These tumors display considerable heterogeneity in expression of various marker genes, including
AR, luminal cytokeratins such as CK8, and neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin or chromogranin.
This heterogeneity is an anticipated consequence of the underlying lineage plasticity of these tumor cells but
leads to confusion in how to precisely define this transition stage, particularly for the purpose of eligibility for
clinical trials. Recent insights from tumor sequencing have identified additional features associated with lineage
plasticity, such as genomic alterations in TP53 and RB1, increased expression of EZH2 and SOX2, and
activation of stem-like RNA signatures, but none of these currently serve as a validated biomarker. In addition
to the diagnostic challenges, this magnitude of heterogeneity raises obvious concerns about the feasibility of
successful therapeutic intervention. Our perspective is that this challenge can be addressed only if we have a
more detailed understanding of the magnitude of heterogeneity and the underlying molecular drivers of that
heterogeneity. Toward that end, we have deployed RNA sequencing and spatial imaging technologies to
characterize intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity in CRPC at a single-cell level. Based on our initial leads, we
will be investigating inhibitors of JAK kinases, FGFR, EZH2, and p300/CBP in preclinical models using patient-
derived organoids and xenografts, to understand these agents’ activity against CRPC that has developed
lineage plasticity. Another major goal of this project is to address this diagnostic challenge by evaluating these
markers in blood-based assays such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) (Aim
3). To that end, we will evaluate the frequency of DLL3 expression and additional CTC/cfDNA biomarkers
representing therapeutic targets in Aim 2, and investigate morphologic, phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity
within biomarker-positive CTC sub-populations. Finally, we will investigate whether persistent CTC
subpopulations can be utilized to provide an early indication of response, identify potential resistance
mechanisms, and guide future therapeutic development. The primary goal of this project will be to leverage our
findings, including focusing on the use of single-cell technology to further characterize this heterogeneity (Aim
1), investigate four drug targets implicated in various stages of lineage plasticity (Aim 2), and develop blood-
based biomarkers of lineage plasticity that can be incorporated into clinical trials (Aim 3)."

 This K08 proposal will expedite the principal investigator’s progress towards his goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist focused on increasing our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of
pulmonary hypertension (PH) and developing innovative therapies to improve outcomes.
 Candidate: Dr. Kel Vin Woo is a physician-scientist at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM).
He completed a fellowship in Pediatric Cardiology and is developing expertise at the intersection of Fibroblast
Growth Factors (FGF) signaling and vascular biology under the mentorship of Dr. David Ornitz, a world authority
on FGF biology. Under Dr. Ornitz’s mentorship, the PI investigated how endothelial FGF signaling modulates
hypoxia-induced PH by mitigating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. He will leverage the skills gained
during his fellowship to further analyze FGF signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and use adenovirus-
delivered endothelial FGF as a potential method of regulating vascular remodeling.
 Career Development Plan: Dr. Woo will pursue this line of research with primary mentorship from Dr. Ornitz
and co-mentorship from Dr. Curiel (an expert in adenovirus vectorology). Additionally, a team of intramural and
extramural advisors include experts in PH, and vascular and pulmonary biology, and all have considerable
experience in nurturing independent investigators. WUSM provides a highly interactive environment with
excellent facilities, resources and opportunities. This 5-year plan builds on the PI’s prior experience and further
enriches his training, providing him with the tools needed for independence. It includes the following objectives:
(1) Master techniques in advanced mouse hemodynamic phenotyping; (2) Become proficient with adenovirus
engineering to improve PH outcomes using preclinical models of hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling; (3)
Disseminate research findings in diverse venues and actively establish productive collaborations.
 Research Plan: The overall hypothesis of the proposal is that FGF signaling in lung endothelial and vascular
smooth muscle cells protects against hypoxia-induced PH. Specific Aim 1 will investigate how smooth muscle
cell FGF prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling. Aim 2 will interrogate how endothelial targeted adenovirus-
delivered FGF reduces hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling and PH severity. Upon completion of the proposed
research, Dr. Woo will be proficient in: (1) modulating intracellular pathways important for endothelial and smooth
muscle cell remodeling; (2) analyzing newly developed conditional knockout mice to ascertain the hemodynamic
effects on the lungs; and (3) developing approaches for gene delivery to lung endothelium as a potential therapy
for pulmonary vascular disease. These acquired skills will be readily applicable to other forms pulmonary
vascular disease and endothelial-smooth muscle interactions in vascular remodeling. Upon completion of the
proposed training, Dr. Woo will have acquired the necessary expertise to become an independent investigator
focused on reducing the burden of pulmonary diseases, in alignment with the NHLBI mission."
10914674,"Project Summary/Abstract
Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by autoimmune
inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13. The only known substrate of ADAMTS13 is von Willebrand factor (VWF).
Cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 is needed to prevent accumulation of ultralarge VWF multimers in the
microvasculature, leading to end-organ damage and potentially life-threatening consequences. Anti-ADAMTS13
IgGs are responsible for the inhibition of the enzyme. The vast majority of inhibitory antibodies target a region of
ADAMTS13 that is principally responsible for binding to the domain of VWF cleaved by the enzyme. However,
the mechanism of inhibition of these antibodies is currently an area of active research, and it is not known if they
primarily prevent substrate binding or decrease catalytic turnover, or if different antibodies inhibit by different
mechanisms. Recent work has shown that ADAMTS13 in iTTP patient plasma exists primarily in a conformation
that exposes a cryptic epitope otherwise hidden when ADAMTS13 is in its latent state. The current paradigm of
ADAMTS13 activity defines this as a so-called “Open” state, and the latent state as “Closed”. A third state also
appears to exist in which ADAMTS13 has the cryptic episode exposed, but also is able to cleave VWF; this is
referred to here as the “Open and Primed” state. Anti-ADAMTS13 IgGs that target distal domains of the protein
appear capable of inducing both the “Open” and “Open and Primed” state. The role of the different conformations
of ADAMTS13 in the pathophysiology of iTTP is unclear, as is the potential role of the distal domain-targeting
IgGs in the disease. Lastly, it is not known if ADAMTS13 activity can be rescued by introducing moieties capable
of competing for the binding of anti-ADAMTS13 IgGs with ADAMTS13. This project aims to elucidate the
mechanism(s) of inhibition of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, characterize the role of distal domain-targeting anti-
ADAMTS13 antibodies in the pathophysiology of the disease, and explore molecular mimics of the binding
epitopes of anti-ADAMTS13 IgGs as a rescue strategy for the disease. My career goal is to become an
independent investigator as a physician scientist, with a focus on the pathophysiology of iTTP. I am currently on
the tenure-track as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematologic
Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC), a large academic
center. My research mentor is Dr. X. Long Zheng, a world-renowned researcher in iTTP. I am afforded 80%
protected time for research under my agreement with the University. My career development plan includes
regular meetings with my Career Advisory Committee, hands-on training in the structural biology techniques

The Summer Program to Increase Diversity in Biomedical Research and the Physician Workforce
encompasses two training initiatives at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Both are
designed to enhance the training experience of underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students who
are interested in pursuing careers in medicine and research. The 8-week summer program for undergraduates
is entitled “The Pritzker School of Medicine Experience in Research (PSOMER).” The 12-week Pritzker
Summer Research Program (SRP) supports the participation of rising second year medical students. The goal
is to provide strongly mentored summer experiences in research, as well as structured programming and
mentoring that will encourage participants to continue into medicine and biomedical research careers. This
grant has been ongoing at the University of Chicago for over 20 years. At the time of the initial award, the goal
was to provide support for SRP participation by Pritzker medical students – a highly diverse group of students,
including higher than average percentages of students who are underrepresented in medicine. Over the years,
the University of Chicago has achieved great success in attracting its medical student graduates to careers in
research and academic medicine, thus supporting efforts to increase the diversity of the faculty at our nation's
medical schools. In 2008, the specific aims of the program were expanded to include PSOMER, developed
specifically for high performing college students who were either members of groups underrepresented in
medicine or were disadvantaged socio-economically. This expansion was prompted by concerns about the
strength of the pipeline channeling such students into medicine and PSOMER was an effort to support and
expand this pipeline. Over the last ten years, PSOMER has supported the preparation of these students for
future success in medicine and biomedical research. In the current funding cycle 19 of the 27 PSOMER
students who completed the program and applied (70%) have been admitted to top medical schools (two in
PhD programs) with 11/19 (58%) of the admissions at the Pritzker School of Medicine. The Summer Program
to Increase Diversity in Biomedical Research and the Physician Workforce has also benefited from a robust
research environment at the University of Chicago, particularly in the mission areas supported by the NHLBI.
Despite being a small institution, the University of Chicago has been highly successful in attracting grant
support. The NHLBI currently funds over 40 research and training programs at the University of Chicago. This
has given us a variety of scientists from whom to choose for student placements, with the goal of identifying as
many mission-related subjects as possible. We are requesting continued support for the research training of 15
students/year. The program enjoys strong institutional support, evidenced by cost-sharing, provision of space,
resources, and training by the BSD and Pritzker School of Medicine. Finally, the University of Chicago provides
a robust research environment to support the goals of this NHLBI supported program."
10912968,"Neuropathogenesis of Rift Valley fever virus
Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) infection causes a spectrum of disease including self-limiting febrile illness,
hepatitis, and late onset encephalitis. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement results in significant morbidity
and mortality and there are no human vaccines or therapeutics in place. Understanding how RVFV disseminates
from the site of a mosquito bite in the skin to the CNS is essential knowledge necessary to identify means to
prevent or treat this manifestation. Neurotropic viruses have evolved many different mechanisms to access the
CNS. These include infection of the brain microvascular endothelial cells (for transcytosis or by causing direct
damage), directly traversing the paracellular junctions of the blood brain barrier (BBB), trafficking into the brain
within a mobile immune cell, infection of a peripheral nerve and retrograde travel, or via inducing inflammation
that loosens endothelial tight junctions and opens the BBB.
Therefore, to answer the foundational question of how RVFV disseminates to the CNS following a peripheral
exposure, we turn to novel rodent CNS infection models developed in our labs. Key to these models of RVFV
neuropathogenesis is the exposure of the mouse to the virus via foot-pad injection to mimic a mosquito bite.
In this proposal we will directly address the gaps in our knowledge of how RVFV disseminates, through a series
of in vitro and in vivo experiments we will establish the route and mechanisms of invasion of the CNS by RVFV."
10914787,"The goal of the project is to develop a disease-modifying treatment for Osteoarthritis (OA) by targeting USP16,
a chromatin modifier involved in regulation of senescence and stem cell self-renewal. The treatment will consist
of an intra-articular injection of a small molecule inhibiting USP16 in patients with moderate OA. USP16 is a
deubiquitinase (DUB) enzyme that removes ubiquitin from histone H2A on lysine 119, a critical mark for the
maintenance of multiple somatic tissues. Interestingly, triplication of USP16 is associated with Down Syndrome
(DS), a congenital disorder characterized by triplication of chromosome 21 (HSA21). Patients with DS show
signs of accelerated aging, including early-onset Alzheimer’s, immune dysfunction and osteoporosis. We have
previously shown that reducing the levels of USP16 in DS mouse models or human tissues results in improved
function of somatic stem cells and reduction in senescence, therefore alleviating the conditions associated with
DS. This evidence makes USP16 an attractive target to ameliorate some of the aging-related pathologies.
Notably, USP16 expression is highly upregulated in OA chondrocytes and synovial tissues. Moreover, the
genetic locus of USP16 contains a SNP strongly associated with familial OA. We found that genetic
downregulation of USP16 in patient-derived articular chondrocytes promotes cellular and mitochondrial health
and reduces senescence associated markers, like SA-ꞵ-gal and p16Ink4a. Moreover, microarray analyses of OA
chondrocytes treated with siRNA targeting USP16 showed an increase in markers of proliferation and collagen
deposition, and a reduction of apoptosis and catabolism markers. Furthermore, USP16 knockdown in human
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells promoted differentiation into mature chondrocytes and increased
matrix deposition. Using a biochemical assay testing the enzymatic activity of recombinant human USP16, we
identified small molecule inhibitors. We validated 19 hits with low IC50 and chose small molecule scaffolds with
IC50 between 0.06 μM and 9.4 μM. During Phase I of the project we will optimize them to increase potency,
specificity and solubility. During Phase II we will move the two best compound series into Lead Optimization,
followed by preclinical efficacy in OA models and early toxicity testing of the two best lead compounds. We will
assess their safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), ability to engage target and modulate chromatin as a
pharmacodynamic (PD) measure, and efficacy in preventing or reversing loss of cartilage in a surgical rat OA
model, with the goal of establishing a relationship between time on target, dose and efficacy. We will also study
the role of the rs6516886 SNP and understand if specific variants of this genomic locus are linked to differential
expression of USP16 and different responses to treatment, potentially leading to stratification of the target patient
population. The proposed studies will inform subsequent GLP studies to support an IND and clinical trial."

This EDRN-CVC proposal is aimed at the validation of molecular biomarkers for distinguishing high versus low

prospective study to identify a patient group at low progression risk who can be spared EET; the second, a phase
3 retrospective study to distinguish individuals who following EET are at low versus high risk of disease
recurrence. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer
with 80% lethality whose incidence has increased more than 7-fold in the past three decades. BE progresses to
EAC in a step-wise fashion from non-dysplastic BE, to low grade dysplasia (LGD), to high grade dysplasia (HGD),
and finally cancer. EAC prevention is based on using EET to ablate HGD BE before it can progress to EAC.
However, increasingly, EET is also becoming the default therapy for LGD, a highly imprecise diagnosis about
which expert pathologists frequently disagree, and which is applied to as many as 40% of BE patients at some
point during their course. As EET has a 9% complication rate, the result is an emerging epidemic of overtreatment
of BE with LGD. In a prior EDRN-BDL award, our team developed the “BAD” technology for early detection of
BE progression. In BAD, we used a brushing device to sample a patient’s full BE esophageal segment. We then
analyzed the DNA from this sample using next-generation sequencing technology (developed for liquid biopsy
assays) to instead detect presence of BE clones that had acquired gains or losses on specific driver
chromosomes associated with EAC. Detection of driver chromosome changes (dubbed Very-BAD), typified EAC
and HGD. In contrast, 28% of LGD showed complete absence of any chromosomally aberrant clones (dubbed
Not-BAD). We will now validate Not-BAD as a biomarker that identifies LGD at such low progression risk as to
not require EET. We will do this by partnering with the SURVENT trial, that will be the first U.S. prospective study
to follow LGD patients managed by surveillance, not ablation. A second major challenge with EET is that over
25% of patients recur following ablation (with either high risk BE, HGD, or EAC). These patients face a substantial
burden of post-EET surveillance endoscopies, initially at every 3-month intervals. In our prior EDRN-BDL, our
team identified a panel of methylated DNA biomarkers for sensitive molecular early detection of BE (currently
awarded FDA breakthrough device designation). We have further identified that these markers remain retained
in a subset of patients post-EET. We accordingly now propose a retrospective Phase 3 study to further validate
these DNA markers for molecular assessment of minimal residual disease, whose post-EET elimination identifies
individuals achieving complete molecular eradication of BE, and hence at low risk of disease recurrence and not
in need of intense post-EET surveillance. We do this by partnering with the unique UNC-BEECAB biorepository
of post-EET esophageal biopsies from patients whose disease did or did not recur following ablation."

There is an urgent need to implement effective tobacco cessation interventions in HIV care programs in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs) where most tobacco users and people with HIV live. India is an
important setting in which to test tobacco cessation interventions with an estimated 275 million tobacco users
and 2 million people living with HIV (PWH). Effective medications and behavioral interventions have not been
well tested in HIV care settings in LMICs. In high income settings, Positively Smoke Free (PSF), a theory-
based behavioral intervention, has demonstrated efficacy among PWH and been adapted for mobile phone
delivery (PSF-M). Mobile health interventions offer scalability and may be more effective among PWH than
face-to-face. Varenicline is the cessation medication with the strongest evidence of efficacy in PWH but
achieving sufficient adherence to sustain long-term success is a challenge. We propose to combine the two
most promising cessation interventions among PWH, varenicline and PSF-M, enhanced with varenicline
adherence support. They will be tested at the Voluntary Health Services (VHS) Infectious Disease Medical
Center, Chennai Antiviral Research and Treatment Clinical Research Site, where 24% of patients new to HIV
care are current smokers or dual users of smoked and smokeless tobacco and 83% own mobile phones. In
this setting we propose the following specific aims: (1) To demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated
intervention combining varenicline plus mobile behavioral treatment among tobacco users in HIV care on
biochemically verified tobacco abstinence at 24 weeks compared to a standard care control; (2): To evaluate
the implementation processes of the integrated intervention in an LMIC HIV practice; and (3): To measure the
costs and cost-effectiveness of an integrated intervention with varenicline and PSF-M. To accomplish these
aims, PSF-M will be adapted to the VHS context and novel content about smokeless tobacco and medication
adherence self-efficacy will be added. A randomized two-arm trial will compare the combination of varenicline
and PSF-M to a standard care control. We will evaluate implementation processes within HIV care workflows
including acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and costs and conduct cost-effectiveness analysis to assess
the clinical impact and value of the integrated intervention if scaled-up. The work proposed is responsive to the
specific interests in RFA-CA-20-037 by testing the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions with
demonstrated efficacy in other settings and adapted for an LMIC context, evaluating the implementation
process from multiple stakeholder perspectives in an HIV care practice, and assessing the clinical impact and
value of the integrated intervention if implemented at scale. The successful completion of this work will move
the field forward by advancing our understanding of the effectiveness of an integrated tobacco cessation
intervention in HIV care settings and projecting the population level impacts of implementing the integrated
intervention for PWH in India or other LMICs."

Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 3-5 times greater prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD) than typically developing children. Despite this higher risk of ADHD, rates of stimulant
medication treatment are disproportionately low in children with DS+ADHD even though stimulants are the
most efficacious ADHD treatment and are recommended by consensus guidelines for use in children with
intellectual disability (ID) and comorbid ADHD. Possible reasons for under-utilization of stimulant treatment in
DS+ADHD include: 1) diagnostic uncertainty regarding how to accurately diagnose ADHD in children with DS,
making providers prone to “diagnostic overshadowing” (i.e., attributing ADHD to the ID); 2) there is not a single
clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of stimulant medication in children with DS+ADHD; and 3)
concerns about cardiac safety, given the high incidence of congenital heart disease or defects (CHD) in the DS
population. We propose a pilot study to define the clinical features of DS+ADHD thereby enabling more
accurate diagnosis and a pilot clinical trial to inform sample size estimates for a larger clinical trial. We propose
to perform the first randomized clinical trial of stimulant medication in children with DS+ADHD to provide
evidence regarding the short and long-term safety and efficacy of stimulant use in children with DS+ADHD,
both with and without CHD. One hundred (100) children with DS+ADHD and 70 children with DS and no ADHD
(DS-ADHD), all aged 6-12 and matched on age, gender, and IQ, will participate. All 170 children enrolled in the
study will complete a comprehensive assessment battery evaluating ADHD diagnostic criteria as well as
behavioral, cognitive, academic, and functional impairments. The 100 children in the DS+ADHD group will also
complete a multi-phased randomized, double-blind clinical trial with crossover to placebo and long-term follow-
up to assess the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of stimulant medications for treating ADHD
symptoms and impairment in children with DS. Study aims will focus on 1) Identifying behavioral, cognitive,
academic, and functional impairments that differentiate children with DS+ADHD from children with DS-ADHD;
2) Informing sample size of larger clinical trial; 3) Assessing the short- and long-term safety of stimulant
treatment in children with DS+ADHD with a specific focus on cardiac safety; 4) Determining the short- and
long-term efficacy of stimulant treatment at remediating cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairments in
children with DS+ADHD; and 5) Exploring moderators (e.g., IQ, ADHD subtype, executive functioning,
comorbid internalizing disorders, CHD) of stimulant response and side effects. Results from this study will
provide much needed diagnostic and treatment data that will directly impact the outcomes of the approximately
45,000 children with DS+ADHD nationwide."
10915127,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A hallmark of substance use disorders is continued drug use despite profound adverse consequences. While
studies in rodents have suggested that leveraging both positive and negative valence processing can affect
this compulsive pattern of reward-seeking behavior in conflict with punishment, the underlying mechanisms
that regulate valence processing and guide ultimate behavioral selections remain unknown. Studies have
shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) projections to the nucleus accumbens (BLA-NAc) preferentially
encode positive valence, including sucrose and cocaine predictive cues and drive approach behaviors, while
projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (BLA-CeM) encode negative valence and drive avoidance.
This evidence strongly suggests that BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons could encode valence processing
during compulsive cocaine seeking and collectively mediate decision-making during ongoing behavior. This
proposed project aims to identify basic neural substrates that guide the valence assignment among BLA-NAc
and BLA-CeM neurons (K99 Phase), and examine whether the same mechanism contributes to the encoding
of compulsive cocaine-seeking (R00 Phase). Preliminary data suggest that neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid
peptide, plays a critical role in mediating valence processing in the BLA. Specifically, activation of terminals of
the paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT) NT neurons in the BLA enhanced reward learning and impaired
punishment learning, while disruption of the PVT-BLA NTergic signaling produced the opposite behavioral
effects. During the K99 phase of the award, the applicant will receive training on using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated
gene manipulation to interrogate NTergic contributions without affecting glutamate and applying machine
learning-based computer vision tools and classification algorithms to extract distinct behavioral motifs and
decode neural correlates. This training will allow the applicant to investigate the specific roles of NT in valence
assignment and coding properties of BLA neurons during valence processing. To test this, the applicant will
examine the impact of the CRISPR-mediated knockdown of the Nt gene in BLA-projecting PVT neurons on
reward and punishment learning (Aim 1) and the effects of the knockdown on valence encoding properties of
BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons during a reward and punishment discrimination task (Aim 2). After securing
an independent research position, the applicant will begin the R00 phase of the award by combining these
approaches gleaned from the K99 phase with applicant’s expertise in studying cocaine addiction with self-
administration and punished reward-seeking paradigms, to investigate how PVT NTergic inputs modulate the
encoding of compulsive cocaine-seeking (Aim 3). Together, the training and scientific advances that will be
achieved through the completion of this project will allow the applicant to secure a tenure track faculty position
in a top research university and provide critical pilot data necessary to prepare the first R01 application to study
more distributed neural pathways that govern motivated behavior and compulsive drug-seeking."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with severe impairment of memory,
cognition and executive functions that has a tremendous health and economic burden. Neurovascular unit (NVU)
and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction play a key etiological role in AD progression; yet the contribution of
genetic versus environmental risk factors for brain microvascular damage is unclear. This project will generate
validated human pluripotent stem cells (PSC)-derived NVU cells, develop a perfused microphysiological NVU
3D system with plasma or blood from young or aged patients and compare its transcriptome profiles with the
human AD brain vasculome to dissect the contribution of genetic versus age-related factors in AD. We have
used CRISPR/Cas9 methodology to knock-in FAD or LOAD mutations in control PSC cell lines, and developed
strategies to differentiate PSC-derived cells into brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), pericytes or
astrocytes and build brain-on-a-chip models with NVU cells and flow. Moreover, our preliminary single nucleus
RNA-seq of human AD brains has identified 4 distinct BMEC populations, at the transcriptome level, one of which
is positively correlated with cognitive impairment, A and tau accumulation. We hypothesize that synergistic
interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors impair NVU function and BBB properties by altering
key neurovascular signaling pathways or transcription factors. We will address this hypothesis with three aims.
In Aim 1, we will optimize protocols to generate BMECs via transdifferentiation from primed ECs, verify their
molecular identity with single cell RNA-seq and validate their biological function using relevant cellular, imaging
and functional approaches. We will incorporate BMECs into an NVU microfluidic system along with hPSC-
derived pericytes and astrocytes and compare cell biological, transcriptome, imaging and functional barrier
properties between NVUs carrying AD-associated risk genes and isogenic controls. In Aim 2, we will isolate the
vasculome compartment from human post-mortem brains and assess differences in vasculome profiles from
control and AD brains. We will evaluate whether AD-associated transcriptional changes in BMECs, pericytes
and astrocytes in vivo are present in the microphysiological NVU 3D system derived from hPSC lines carrying
AD-associated risk genes. Finally in Aim 3, we will assess whether treatment with proteasome inhibitors (to
mimic loss of proteostatis), agents that produce advanced glycation end products, or dynamic flow of aged versus
young blood from control or AD patients alters the morphology and transcriptome profiles of NVU cells and
transport across the BBB. This Diversity Supplement will allow us to extend these studies to characterize LOAD
mutant astrocytes more deeply as well as see how induction of senescence modulates these phenotypes both
in monolayer and in 3D NVUs. The proposed studies will establish a novel perfused blood/NVU 3D
microphysiological system that will allow us to leverage its relevance to changes in the AD brain vasculome and
examine the interactions between genetic and environment factors for AD vascular pathology."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a worldwide public health problem, occurring in ~25% of the global
adult population. Despite major investments by the pharmaceutical industry, there are no approved drugs for
the treatment of NAFLD, probably reflecting the heterogeneous pathophysiology involving multiple pathways.
We have recently implemented the human biomimetic, vascularized Liver Acinus Microphysiology System
(vLAMPS) using all-human primary liver cells (hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial, stellate and Kupffer
cells) from the same genotyped patients in a NAFLD experimental model. We have initiated the testing of more
than 100 drugs and drug combinations recently predicted through the application of quantitative systems
pharmacology (QSP). We have also been working toward the implementation of all iPSC-derived liver cells
from the same patients that will be completed at the time of starting the proposed study. The use of patient-
specific iPSC-derived cells is critical to produce reproducible patient cohorts for precision medicine. We also
harness the Microphysiology Systems Database (MPS Db) to manage, analyze and to determine
reproducibility of the NAFLD experimental models. There is a critical need to develop and implement high
content and throughput NAFLD MPS models based on iPSC-derived cells that demonstrate maximal
reproducibility. The goal of this collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery
Institute (UPDDI) and the NCATS 3D Tissue Bioprinting Laboratory (3DTBL) is to harness the liver acinus
design into a higher throughput biomimetic by developing a bioprinted all-iPS plate-based, NAFLD model to
maximize throughput of testing the predicted drugs and combinations, model functionality and reproducibility
with selected primary screen metrics. We will also bioprint the middle layer of the existing high content
vLAMPS to improve the reproducibility of this secondary drug testing platform that will use the full panel of
metrics that have been previously published resulting in an improved compound selection platform for the
development of precision NAFLD therapeutics. The lack of approved therapeutics for treatment of NAFLD is
due in large part to the heterogenous pathology of the disease involving multiple pathways and the use of
animal models that do not fully recapitulate the human disease. The development of a combined high
throughput and high content NAFLD experimental model for a primary screen of predicted drugs and optimal
combinations using human, patient-specific iPSC-derived liver cells bioprinted in transwell plates will transform
the approach to NAFLD drug discovery to precision medicine. The more detailed analysis of the best drugs
and drug combinations in the bioprinted version of the vLAMPS models will refine the selection of
drugs/combinations for select patient cohorts."
10915167,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Functional MRI (fMRI) is the most widely-used tool to noninvasively measure brain function and has produced
much of our current knowledge about the functional organization of the human brain. All fMRI methods, however,
measure neuronal activity indirectly by tracking the associated local changes in blood flow and oxygenation.
While this is often viewed as a limitation of fMRI, recent optical imaging studies in animal models have shown
that, surprisingly, the smallest blood vessels in the brain respond rapidly to local neuronal activity, and are thus
tightly coupled to neurons, suggesting that fMRI could provide a far more veridical picture of neuronal activity
than previously believed—if one can measure fMRI signals such as BOLD exclusively from the microvasculature.
 In the previous funding cycle, we successfully tested our hypothesis that the neuronal specificity of fMRI can
be improved by restricting analyses to the earliest phases of the standard gradient-echo BOLD response, thought
to occur in the microvasculature, before the responses spread to larger blood vessels and become less spatially
localized. The ability to reliably extract the earliest phases of the BOLD response was achieved through the fast
temporal sampling made possible through the fMRI acquisition technologies we developed. Our findings were
consistent with our hypothesis—the fastest component of the BOLD response provides the highest
microvascular specificity. Here we test the converse hypothesis: that BOLD signals from the microvasculature
are fastest and exhibit the highest temporal specificity, while signals from the macrovasculature are temporally
delayed and smeared. To test this we will develop technologies for spin-echo BOLD, which exclusively measures
from the microvasculature, with fast temporal sampling. In this cycle our central hypothesis is that spin-echo
BOLD with exclusive sensitivity to the microvasculature, will yield higher temporal specificity than gradient-echo
BOLD, which contains slower signals from the macrovasculature. The challenge is that spin-echo acquisitions
in theory provide T2 weighting, endowing spin-echo BOLD with microvascular specificity, however in practice it
is difficult to achieve pure T2 weighting. Thus, our goals are to develop and validate fMRI technologies for robust
pure T2-weighted BOLD, and to test whether pure T2-weighted BOLD provides higher temporal specificity.
 These goals can only be achieved by combining several novel MRI technologies we have recently
introduced. The core technology is Echo-Planar Time-Resolved Imaging (EPTI), an extension to Echo-Planar
Imaging (EPI), which can provide pure T2-weighted BOLD—concurrently with T2*-weighted BOLD, enabling
direct comparisons. We will combine this with our new methods for increasing temporal sampling efficiency
through and motion-robustness, and maximizing signal when using fast sampling rates. Finally, all experiments
will be performed at 7 Tesla, where BOLD exhibits stronger microvascular weighting and higher sensitivity
compared to standard field strengths, using parallel transmit RF pulse designs to reduce power deposition and
improve the spatial uniformity of fMRI sensitivity."

providing a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Modulation of the autonomic nervous system
has been attempted through numerous means including surgical sympathectomy, catheter-based
ablation procedures, and transcutaneous approaches. Although autonomic innervation has been shown
to have a significant effect on arrhythmogenicity, the complex network of interactions and the optimal
strategies for interrupting this network are inadequately characterized. To further the field, this research
will integrate established principles and techniques from neuroscience to study the role of autonomic
neuromodulation in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The investigation will focus on the ability of
repetitive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TcMS) to modulate synaptic strength of autonomic
cardiac innervation. The feasibility of this non-destructive and non-invasive technology is supported by
Dr. Markman’s recent work published in JAMA targeting the cervical sympathetic chain with an inhibitory
TcMS protocol in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. The proposed research plan aims to
improve understanding of the cardiac effects of autonomic neuromodulation, and to assess the efficacy
of TcMS in patients with VT storm. Aim 1 seeks to characterize the cardiac electrophysiological effects
of autonomic neuromodulation by invasively measuring conduction properties as well as levels of
catecholamines and inflammatory cytokines before and after neuromodulation. This will develop critical
tools for characterizing neural-cardiac interactions, allowing definitive assessment of their complex
relationship.
Aim 2 seeks to characterize the cardiac electrophysiological effects of autonomic neuromodulation by
invasively measuring conduction properties as well as levels of catecholamines and inflammatory
cytokines before and after neuromodulation. In combination, the findings from these aims will yield critical
information regarding the mechanistic characterization of complex cardiac-neural pathways and help
establish the role of a novel method of neuromodulation. In addition, this research will promote critically
important continued interdisciplinary collaboration between neuroscientists and cardiovascular medicine.
Dr. Markman, an early career investigator and a fellow in cardiac electrophysiology, has a long-term goal
of establishing an independent research program in autonomic neuromodulation focused on
mechanistically defining the complex neural circuits involved in cardiac arrhythmias. These research aims
are part of a comprehensive training plan and will be supervised by a mentorship and advisory team
consisting of national leaders in arrhythmia and neuroscience research and will guide his transition to an
independently funded research career."

Widespread use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past two decades has improved
the clinical manifestations and altered the pathology of neurologic disease in people living with
HIV (PLWH). However, in the context of this treatment that has successfully prolonged millions
of lives, new pressing questions have emerged regarding the etiology of persistent neurological
and cognitive impairment that frequently manifests in PLWH on ART. The human brain is a
complex and inaccessible organ that, to date, defies comprehensive understanding in the
context of homeostasis and disease. Thus, the hallmark neuropathologic finding of HIV
associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), synaptodendritic injury, has thus far only been
possible to evaluate in post-mortem human autopsy brains and animal models of HIV. Our
group at Yale recently developed and validated a novel positron-emission tomography (PET)
radiotracer, [11C]UCB-J, a ligand for the presynaptic vesicular membrane protein synaptic
vesicular glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), to image synaptic density in the human brain. The premise of
this application is based on our ongoing pilot study which demonstrates that brain SV2A PET
successfully identifies regions of reduced synaptic density -- including in a hippocampal-
frontostriatal neural circuit that correlates with CNS dysfunction -- in PLWH on ART. In the
current proposal, we seek to measure synaptic density longitudinally over 24 months in a larger
group of PLWH on ART relative to a matched prospectively enrolled HIV-negative group. We
will combine this breakthrough imaging methodology of synaptic density with PET imaging of
neuroimmune status (using radioligand [11C]PBR28 targeting the 18-kDa translocator protein, or
TSPO, sensitive to microglia) to explore the premise that neuroimmune dysregulation during
ART mediates reduced synaptic density. Finally, we aim to longitudinally integrate these
measures with neurocognitive and laboratory assessments in parallel processing models that
allow us to dissect mechanisms and clinical outcomes of HAND. Our application is based on
robust and compelling preliminary data that demonstrates the utility of SV2A PET imaging in
identifying regions of reduced synaptic density in PLWH on ART. Our proposed project will
generate powerful clinical-translational support for potentially reversible brain alterations in
synaptic density, and their relation to microglia levels and clinical and biological measures in
PLWH. This program will set the stage for identification of therapeutic targets and provide a
biomarker for interventional studies aimed to improve HIV-related injury in the CNS."

admitted to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS). New methods to enable the interpretation and functional
characterization of these VUS would not only enhance the efficacy of current therapies by better informing patient
selection strategies, but also accelerate the development of new approaches to combat diseases with a genetic

potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, but
traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as
well as unwanted gene alterations, particularly when attempting to introduce point mutations due to their reliance
on double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). Recently, I developed a class of genome editing agents called base
editors that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a catalytically inactive Cas9 tethered to a single-stranded
DNA modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases in genomic DNA. Two classes of editors
currently exist, which use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base
pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. My research program involves both the
development of new base editor methodologies, as well as the utilization of currently available base editor tools
to functionally interrogate VUS. Direction 1 research aims to develop new base editors capable of facilitating
new point mutations using computationally-aided directed evolution. The resulting tools will be of broad interest

base editing will allow us to functionally interrogate these co-occurring variants and assess their contribution to
human genetic diseases. Finally, Direction 3 research proposes the development of high-throughput base
editing, which will allow for the functional investigation of tens of thousands of SNVs at a time. While we currently
have the tools to begin work in all three areas, our research Directions are designed such that progress in any

 Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a histone methyltransferase (HMTase) that sequentially deposits three
methyl groups onto lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me1/2/3), and its activity is crucial for epigenetic silencing during
development and cancer. How PRC2 is targeted to genetic loci is of considerable interest, given its critical function and
abundance of target genes. It’s well accepted that PRC2 interacts broadly with RNA, and that these interactions regulate
PRC2’s localization at genomic sites destined for epigenetic silencing. However, the details about the nature and
mechanism(s) of PRC2’s regulation by RNA remain quite controversial. While some studies have proposed a role for
RNA in PRC2’s recruitment to chromatin, more have suggested roles in PRC2 eviction from chromatin and/or inhibition
of PRC2 activity. Notably, a recent work has demonstrated that the PRC2-RNA interaction is critical in vivo for
maintaining H3K27me3 levels and chromatin occupancy at PRC2 target genes. Thus, while there’s evidence RNA plays a
role in evicting PRC2 from chromatin under certain conditions, it also seems it must facilitate chromatin binding and
H3K27me3 deposition in at least some circumstances. To date, the PRC2 literature lacks direct evidence for a mechanism
that can reconcile these prior data and explain RNA-mediated chromatin-binding and HMTase activity by PRC2. My
preliminary data unexpectedly imply PRC2 has the intrinsic capacity to transfer directly between polynucleotides, and this
phenomenon could be broadly relevant to RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Based on these
and other data, I hypothesize a ‘hand-off’ model where PRC2 can be directly transferred between nascent RNA and
spatially proximal chromatin to facilitate H3K27me3 deposition or eviction from chromatin. Studies proposed herein will
quantify PRC2’s binding and competition kinetics for RNA and DNA/nucleosomes, determine the polynucleotide species
PRC2 could be transferred between, characterize the prevalence and biophysical requisites of this phenomenon in other
proteins, and interrogate the effect of RNA-nucleosome spatial relationships on PRC2’s HMTase activity. Findings from
these studies will expand our understanding of how chromatin-modifying enzymes are regulated, which could have
profound implications in our understanding of cell differentiation, embryonic development, and cancer."

The proposed Biomedical Informatics and Behavioral Sciences (BIBS) Summer Research
Program seeks to encourage underrepresented students to pursue oral health research careers.
In 2000, Oral Health in America: A report of the Surgeon General reframed oral diseases as a
bona fide public health issue. Subsequent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have
exposed inequities in the United States (U.S.) public health infrastructure whose causes and
persistence are often poorly understood. The U.S. dental public health system is no different.
Our central hypothesis is twofold: too few health professionals are engaged in oral health and
dental services research; and insufficient diversity in their ranks hampers the study of oral
health disparities. To address this supposition, the Texas A&M University (TAMU) College of
Dentistry (COD) will develop a new summer program for undergraduate and post-baccalaureate
students interested in dentistry, dental students with a master’s degree, or dental residents with
a master’s degree, particularly the Master of Public Health degree. This innovative program will
leverage the COD’s existing pipeline programming for underrepresented students. BIBS will be
a first-time collaboration among the TAMU Center for Statistical Bioinformatics, the TAMU
Department of Public Health Sciences, and the Texas Oral Health Coalition. Having faculty from
three complementary health research specialties will add perspective for students. In this
proposal, six talented trainees per summer will participate in a comprehensive 9-week program.
The first six weeks will consist of coursework in biomedical informatics and behavioral sciences,
in which trainees will learn programming, statistics, tools for analyzing large data sets, and
codes specific to dental procedures and dental public health. At the start of the program, each
trainee will be paired with a mentor. Working together, they will develop a tailored mentorship
plan and conduct a research project. At the end of the program, trainees will present their
projects and results in a newly established “BIBS Summer Research Conference.”"

Novel intervention strategies to increase physical activity need to reduce barriers to exercise and increase
adherence to achieve optimal brain health benefits. Despite considerable physical and brain health benefits
associated with exercise, most adults fail to adhere to recommended physical activity guidelines. Barriers,
including lack of time and low enjoyment of exercise, can lead to reduced adherence. Dual-system neural
models of behavior theorize two systems that drive behavior and can be engaged in interventions. The reward
brain system responds to and evaluates the rewarding properties of stimuli in the environment and drives
behaviors. The regulation brain system downregulates responses to rewarding stimuli and promotes healthy
behaviors by helping individuals adhere to and achieve their goals. Our long-term goal is to develop
enhancements to health behavior interventions that engage the reward and regulation mechanisms related to
increase adherence and promote optimal brain health. The rationale for the proposed study is based on previous
studies showing relationships between regulation, positive affect, and exercise and our preliminary data that
show targeting the regulation and reward systems increases healthy choices and positive affect. we will apply
the NIH Stage Model to develop guided imagery to target reward AND regulation brain systems and assess the
impact on exercise adherence. First, we will test a brief guided imagery approach to engage regulation and
reward brain systems and the acceptability of HIIT in mid-life adults (R61). We will use guided imagery that
includes PAI to increase positive associations with exercise and/or EFT to increase focus on one's healthy,
physically active, future self and increase regulation. We will dynamically refine the HIIT exercise intervention to
increase acceptability. Systematically testing the independent effects of engaging reward or regulation on
changes in reward and regulation indices and refining the HIIT protocol will help us develop the optimal
behavioral and exercise intervention approach. Next, we will test this approach and the impact on exercise
adherence and physical activity in a 6-week HIIT exercise intervention (R33). This innovative study fills a gap in
the current literature by examining the impact of EFT and positive affect guided imagery among mid-life adults
and will inform future interventions to improve health decision-making, promote healthy behaviors and brain
health, and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease."

10910077,"The metastatic capacity of prostate cancer (PCa) behaves along a spectrum of disease that contains an
oligometastatic state where metastases are limited in number and location. The importance of radiation
consolidation of all tumor deposits in oligometastatic PCa to forestall further metastatic dissemination is now
backed by small randomized studies in the recurrent setting, but the utility in the de novo space is unknown. Our
Baltimore ORIOLE randomized trial of stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) alone, highly focused, high-dose
radiation, versus observation in oligometastatic PCa demonstrated a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of
SABR alone. Furthermore, using state-of-the-art genomic profiling techniques we demonstrated that radiation
resulted in a systemic immune response that could possibly predict patient benefit from SABR. Total
consolidative radiation approaches have not been tested in the de novo oligometastatic space for PCa. Thus,
we propose this first-in-man opportunity to understand the interplay between micrometastatic disease and the
primary PCa following radiation consolidation of macroscopic disease has the potential to: (1) uncover novel
radiobiology implications on the metastatic process; and (2) provide a curative paradigm for patients with de
novo oligometastatic PCa. For this proposal, we will leverage resources from a soon to be activated randomized
trial of total radiation consolidation for de novo oligometastatic men – Phase 2 randomized Total Eradication of
metastatic lesions following definitive Radiation to the Prostate in de novo oligometaStatic prostate cancer
(TERPS) trial. TERPS is a phase II non-blinded, randomized 1:1 trial of men with de novo oligometastatic PCa
treated with best systemic therapy (BST) + primary prostate radiation (XRT) versus BST+XRT+ stereotactic
ablative radiation metastasis-directed therapy (SABR MDT). Now, strategies to define the patients who may
benefit the most from SABR metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) are needed using biomarkers. This current U54
ROBIN Oligometastasis (ROBIN OligoMET) Molecular Characterization Trial (MCT) proposal is to conduct
correlative studies from this first-in-man randomized trial of SABR MDT in men with de novo oligometastatic
prostate cancer. We hypothesize macroscopic prostate tumors support the growth of and help nurture future
distant metastases. In addition, we hypothesize that tissue, imaging and circulating biomarkers can identify men
with de novo PCa oligometastasis that benefit the most from SABR. AIM #1 – To validate prognostic-predictive
ability of tissue and liquid biomarkers using the first-in-man randomized trial of stereotactic ablative radiation
(SABR) consolidation in men with de novo oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.
AIM #2 – To
validate prognostic-predictive ability of radiomics using the first-in-man randomized trial of stereotactic ablative
radiation (SABR) consolidation in men with de novo oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer."
10910079,"Patterns of disease failure in prostate cancer (PCa) suggest understanding metastasis will result in the largest
therapeutic gains and allow for more rationale clinical management. The importance of consolidating all sites of
macroscopic disease including the primary to impede further metastatic dissemination is backed by limited
prospective randomized studies. However, the question of whether total consolidation by treating the
metastases with radiation in PCa further impedes the metastatic process and survival is unanswered. It is
generally assumed that metastasis is a unidirectional flow of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) leaving the primary
tumor and seeding a metastasis at a distant site with each metastasis growing independently of the others.
However, CTCs may undergo a cyclical “self-seeding” process, wherein cells with metastatic potential return to
the “idealized” microenvironment of the primary tumor and other macroscopic tumor deposits resulting in more
robust CTCs. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) programs composed of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) are developmental programs that can
engender epithelial cells with metastatic properties. We propose the dynamic EMP program directs PCa cells
to revert back and forth from EMT-MET to facilitate self-seeding. Stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) is a
highly focused, high-dose short radiation course that is suited for treatment of metastases as it targets the
cancer cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) cells. Interventions that effectively target the TME
component, such as SABR, appear poised to arrest self-seeding and subsequent maturation of metastases.
We are in the final stages to launch our TERPS trial - Phase 2 randomized Total Eradication of metastatic
lesions following definitive Radiation to the Prostate in de novo oligometaStatic prostate cancer. Thus, we
have developed the following HYPOTHESES: (1) EMP programs control self-seeding and the metastatic
potential of PCa; (2) CTCs with low EMT and/or high MET markers are representative of men with
oligometastatic PCa; (3) Consolidative SABR of metastases alters the natural history of oligometastatic PCa;
and, (4) Consolidative SABR alters the potential for maturation of future metastases that can be detected by
changes in CTC marker profiles and enumeration levels and/or tissue, liquid or imaging biomarkers. We will
test the following two aims. AIM #1: Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are
biomarkers for men with oligometastatic prostate cancer treated with SABR. We will pursue a number of
correlative tissue, liquid, imaging and immune studies from our TERPS trial to examine for EMP markers -
EMT and MET. AIM #2: To determine the effects of SABR on prostate cancer self-seeding in epithelial-
mesenchymal plasticity prostate cancer mouse models. Use cell based EMP PCa models and serial non-
invasive imaging in mice to test the self-seeding hypothesis for PCa and if EMP factors modulate self-seeding."
10910081,"Altered metabolism in cancer cells is recognized as a hallmark of malignant transformation and has been
shown to be in part responsible for metastatic spread due to its role in the fate of anchoring metastases to the
tumor microenvironment. Therefore, understanding radiation response as it relates to the tumor and patient
metabolism will be key in determining the subset of patients who will require metabolic interventions to
optimize outcomes for prostate cancer patients with oligometastatic disease. It has been discovered that
genomic drivers of prostate cancer can cause metabolic reprogramming of both the tumor and its
microenvironment to create niches with specific nutrient requirements that enrich for key pro-survival
pathways. For example, that c-myc driven tumors thrive best when activating lipogenic metabolism while akt
activated tumors thrive by activating the classic glycolytic switch. Understanding how to specifically reprogram
the metabolic pathways that the tumor is preferentially using to create a favorable growth environment, could
decrease prostate cancer tumor progression, metastases and increase sensitivity to radiation therapy.
Preliminary data demonstrates the ability to use dietary alterations to metabolically alter the tumor and its
environment to decrease tumor progression and metastases. Coupled with radiation, our data shows that
caloric restriction increases anti-tumor immunity by increasing effector T-cells and decreasing T-regulatory
cells. A first in-human pilot clinical trial using caloric restriction before prostatectomy for prostate cancer
patients has confirmed this with a downregulation of c-myc and akt with metabolomic evaluation revealing
decreased lipogenesis and glucogenesis. Pathway analysis of serum profiling demonstrates that caloric
restrictions most significant effect was in upregulating anti-tumor immunity. Since it has been established that
myc driven cancers have altered Treg response and akt driven tumors have altered Teff profiles, we
hypothesize that precision nutrition can be used to reprogram the metabolic alterations induced by the
driver oncogenes to improve radiation response and oligometastatic prostate cancer outcomes by
affecting a positive change in the patients’ anti-tumor immunity. To study this, we will first determine
radiation response of consolidative SABR on oligometastatic prostate cancers that have lipogenic versus
glucogenic metabolic profiles. Next, we will use preclinical models to determine effects of metabolic
reprogramming of prostate cancer cells and tumor microenvironment on radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity
and consequences on metastatic potential. Finally, we will determine the influence of social determinants of
health, including race, on radiation response in prostate cancer patients with oligometastatic disease treated
with radiation. Our diverse patient population will allow for the understanding on the contribution of patient
stressors on radiation outcomes. Results from this proposal will allow for future trial design using a precision
approach to metabolically impact patients and improve outcomes with radiation."

 The role of the administrative core will be to coordinate resources,
expertise and programs across Delaware State University and the University of
Delaware to support the continued success of the Delaware Center for
Neuroscience Research. The focus of the Administrative Core is to build and
sustain a community of researchers across Delaware who are investigating the dynamic functions of the
brain and nervous system, and to grow the number of investigators at our institutions who are competitive
for external funding for their research. The Administrative Core is centered at Delaware State University
with a subcore at the University of Delaware to ensure coordination of efforts at both institutions. The
Administrative Core will provide the oversight necessary for continued success of the Delaware Center for
Neuroscience Research during COBRE Phase III and then to ensure the long-term sustainability of the

10910084,"ABSTRACT 
The resource sharing core of the proposed ROBIN U54 center project will consist of experienced faculties in 
the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland and Department of Pathology at Cornell 
University. A long history of collaboration already exists between the members of this Core and investigators 
on the main projects. The Core will provide centralized and cost-effective support to the projects by providing a 
wide range of data needed for the projects, including multi-omics, imaging, and dosimetry data in radiation 
oncology. The core service provides a crucial way to coordinate data collection, storage, and sharing to ensure 
data from the main projects are analyzed consistently and efficiently. There are three specific aims for this 
core: Aim 1. Provide state-of-the-art methods for multi-omics data analysis and storage to project researchers. 
The core research team has extensive experience in the wide array of genome-wide analyses that are 
planned, and it will therefore provide all necessary expertise for the correct and efficient pre-processing and 
analysis of the multi-omics data generated within each project across the U54 ROBIN center. Sharing the 
multi-omics data within the U54 ROBIN Center will leverage the Cloud Data Warehouse at Cornell, which 
enables the research use of integrated data from multiple clinical systems and analytical platforms. Aim 2: 
Develop tools and infrastructure for extraction, analysis, and storage of imaging and dosimetry data in radiation 
therapy. We will develop tools and databases for extracting, analyzing, and storing the data that are unique for 
radiation therapy, including both imaging data (CT, MRI, PET and CBCT) and dosimetry data (3D dose 
distribution, dose volume histogram for target and organs at risk). We will also develop techniques for image 
quality enhancement as well as radiomics analysis on both imaging and dosimetry data. A graphical user 
interface (GUI) will be developed to facilitate the extraction and analysis of the multi-dimensional data. Aim 3. 
Provide cloud-based platforms and infrastructures for resource sharing across institutions. The cloud-based 
Data Warehouse will be used to store and share multi-omics data at Cornell University, while the cloud-based 
Flywheel software will be used to store and share imaging and dosimetry data at the University of Maryland. 
The database systems will be interfaced with other electronic data systems, and procedures will be instituted to 
ensure data quality, integrity, and confidentiality. The systems will be implemented to enable inter-project 
collaborations and those with external collaborators in the future. The data and tools will be made publically 
available with transparency under a fee-based service model. In summary, the resource sharing core will have 
an integral role in the scientific development, execution, and analysis of all projects. Core investigators are 
committed to working closely with project PIs and investigators to assess any issues that may adversely affect 
resource sharing and implement all necessary changes as the projects progress."
10910085,"Center for Biomedical and Brain Imaging (CBBI)
Summary
 The major objective of the Center for Biomedical and Brain Imaging (CBBI)
Core is to provide support and educational opportunities to neuroscientists in Delaware
who are investigating structure-function-behavior relationships in the brain, and help
them develop new neuroimaging approaches that will advance their research and careers.
By combining animal and human neuroimaging, our CBBI Core serves a second objective of bringing together
biologists, psychologists, biomedical engineers and others who image the human brain, with molecular, cellular and
behavioral neuroscientists who use animal models, to catalyze collaborations focusing on multi-scale investigations of
functional activity in the brain. The University of Delaware (UD) has made a significant investment into building
capabilities for human and animal neuroimaging- purchasing a 3T MRI scanner with the capability to map human brain
structure and function, and with partial support from our Phase II COBRE, a 9.4T, small bore scanner for high
resolution mapping of the structure and function of brains in rodent models.
 Our CBBI core will support investigators utilizing non-invasive neuroimaging techniques by providing access
to collaborators and consulting expertise to help develop innovative projects that can form the basis for competitive,
interdisciplinary grant applications. Our objective for this aim is to increase the number of neuroscience investigators
at DSU, UD and across the state who have research project grant funding from NIH. Currently our CBBI core has
contributed to active R01 awards to six faculty and R21 awards for 8 faculty. Our objective is to double those numbers
to 12 faculty with R01 awards and 16 with R21 awards. Our Phase III COBRE award will support a program of Core
Access Awards to allow Delaware researchers to collect pilot neuroimaging data to support publications and grant
applications. Currently there are 35 faculty PIs using the CBBI Core, and we expect that our Core Access Award
program will grow that number 50% to over 50 by the end of our Phase III award.
 The unifying focus of the Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research is investigating how the dynamic
structures of the brain are changed over the lifespan by experiences, the environment and genetics. Our Biomedical
and Brain Imaging Core provides crucial support for neuroscientists affiliated with the Delaware Center for
Neuroscience Research to reach their full scientific and professional potential - including attaining grant support for
their research. It also creates an environment that helps attract outstanding neuroscience researchers to fill new
positions, at both DSU and UD, while advancing the research of a broader community of neuroscientists already in
Delaware"
10910086,"The Cross-Training Core (CTC) for the U54 ROBIN OligoMET Center will consist of experienced faculty
members of the Division of Computational and Systems Biology (CSP) in the Department of Pathology and
Laboratory Medicine of Weill Cornell Medical College (WCM). The team at WCM will work in close collaboration
with teams at the other Institutions, and a history of collaboration already exists between the CTC team members
and the investigators leading the Research Projects and the other Research Cores, which will further ensure the
successful progression of the Center. The CTC activities will be centered around the following purposes: Aim 1)
To provide a unified analytical framework across the U54 ROBIN OligoMET Center to foster cross-project data
integration and comparison. Imaging, omics, and radiomics data are found in a variety of forms (e.g., different
platforms, file formats, etc.), and training people on how to manage each of these instances is challenging and
inefficient. We will have unified analytical framework within the U54 ROBIN OligoMET Center where data is
aggregated and standardized, greatly decreases the training complexity and increases reproducibility which
results in a more fluid training process. Aim 2) To provide educational support and training across the U54 ROBIN
OligoMET Center. Advances in genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and radiomics technologies have led
to exponential rises in both production and availability of multimodal data. In light of these rapid evolutions,
disseminating the latest bioinformatics methods within the U54 Center – and the broader biomedical community
– is a challenge of paramount importance. The CTC will address such challenge by creating an open educational
platform that will provide a rich interactive learning environment, leveraging a cloud-based framework to
collaboratively create and share tutorials and learning experiences. To this end, the CTC will build upon a 10-
year experience in the computational genomics and data science domains and training biologists and clinicians
in computational methods. Aim 3) To develop novel analytical approaches for the comprehensive
characterization of oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa) via integrated analyses of multimodal big data. Omics
and radiomics technologies, multiparametric in situ imaging, and spatially-resolved molecular and image
analyses are rapidly evolving fields. Therefore, continually evolving technologies, software, algorithms, and
analytical methods are efforts of essence. PCa investigations across the U54 ROBIN OligoMET Center
encompass a multitude of these domains, hence it is of paramount importance that a versatile and innovative
portfolio of approaches is developed to fully support the ongoing and future research. The U54 ROBIN OligoMET
Center will therefore provide an ideal platform for such cross-disciplinary training, and the CTC will support such
crucial endeavor through developing and disseminating ad-hoc training modules across the whole U54 ROBIN
OligoMET Center and the other ROBIN Centers."
10910089,"Cell Electrophysiology Core
Summary
 The primary purpose for this core is to support infrastructure to provide
investigators in the neuroscience community in Delaware with access to
electrophysiological methods to answer their research questions. Cell electrophysiology
provides unique functional assessment and characterization of excitable cells, tissues
and ion channels. However, electrophysiological experiments require expensive,
specialized equipment, as well as years of time to develop the necessary technical skills for data collection and analysis,
and are therefore out of reach for laboratories that are not specialized in that area. This core was established as part of
our Phase II COBRE in response to a needs-assessment among the biomedical research community in Delaware that
identified a pool of 13 externally-funded researchers throughout the state who wanted to collect electrophysiological
data from their model systems, but lacked the means to do so. A survey of graduate students conducted at the annual
Delaware Neuroscience Symposium in 2018 found many would like to get some experience with cell electrophysiology
to expand the scope of their research projects and broaden their repertoire of techniques.
 Support from our Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research COBRE and the statewide Delaware IDeA
Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) enabled the purchase of electrophysiology instrumentation
supporting traditional patch clamp, multi-electrode array recordings, and automated patch clamp, ensuring state-of-
the-art instrumentation in the core. Our core will provide Delaware neuroscientists access to electrophysiological
techniques, experienced collaborators and consulting expertise that will increase the innovation and impact of their
research and make them more competitive for external funding. Continued support through a Phase III COBRE award
will allow broad dissemination of the availability of our CE Core, its instrumentation and services. By the end of our
Phase III award we expect that our CE Core will have measurable downstream impacts including increased numbers
of research publications and greater external funding at Delaware State University, an Historically Black university, as
well as across the state of Delaware. The increased level of research activity will provide new research and training
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students both within the DSU and other institutions in Delaware."
10910090,"Vivarium Core
Summary
 The objective of this core is to support the operations of the Vivarium facility
at Delaware State University and ensure that it provides both efficient operations to
support the research of COBRE investigators at DSU and high quality care for our
rodent research subjects. The research of several faculty members supported by the
Phase I and Phase II COBRE awards depends on the operation of the vivarium for husbandry of mouse models for
their research. Our COBRE Vivarium core will provide support and staff to maintain operations of our new rodent
housing facility which was renovated with support from our Phase I COBRE grant, and which became fully
operational in early 2017. COBRE support for the Vivarium Core at DSU will maintain the animal care staff
including animal care technician, a facility manager and partial support for a veterinarian, so that the facility can
provide outstanding animal care for COBRE-affiliated researchers to increase their research productivity. As the
level of funding for faculty research grows eventually the facility can be sustained by charges to faculty research
grants.
 We also propose to purchase and install the Tecniplast DVC® (Digital Ventilated Caging) complete system
in the Vivarium. The complete system allows for 24/7 monitoring of food and water levels, as embedded sensors
into the lateral runners detect the presence of food and water bottles cage by cage. The system evaluates bedding
conditions and identifies when cages need to be changed reducing running costs, avoiding unnecessary animal
handling, and providing 24/7 detection of unexpected water floods due to mishaps with water bottles. The round-
the-clock animal activity detection allows for continuous animal welfare information, and since vital animal
parameters (drinking, feeding, anomalies in locomotor activity) can be detected remotely, it will reduce the
personnel entering the animal facilities. Real-time monitoring the environmental parameters and cage characteristics
will also add precision to the timing of cage changes and other care-taking activities, reducing the need for staff
time.
 With automated 24/7 tracking of the status of the cage environment and animal activity, the DVC system
significantly improves animal welfare and facility efficiency and productivity, while providing researchers with a
unique data stream that can improve the translational potential of their animal models. Continuation of the COBRE-
supported Vivarium core will significantly advance the research program of COBRE investigators and help DSU
recruit outstanding candidates for future faculty openings."
10910093,"Investigator Development Core
Summary
 The previous 50 years have seen a revolution in the conceptual
approaches and scientific tools to investigate the brain and behavior. This has
led to explosive growth in our knowledge and understanding of the brain,
increased clinical applications for that knowledge, and the growth of neuroscience as a discipline. Our
expanding knowledge is also broadening the scope of the field of neuroscience and spinning off exciting
new disciplines such as neuroethics, social neuroscience, neuroimmunology, and neuromicrobiology.
Continued progress in growing our knowledge about the brain and establishing Delaware as an important
contributor to that progress requires expanding the state’s pool of neuroscience investigators who can lead
creative research programs and be competitive for independent grants.
 The mission of our Investigator Development (ID) Core is to expand the capacity of the universities
in our Delaware Neuroscience Center to support neuroscience research by preparing a cadre of investigators
competitive for NIH Research Project Grants and other funding for neuroscience research at multiple scales,
from human subjects to rodent and invertebrate models. Our Neuroscience Center will carryout its mission
by: 1) Establishing a competitive pilot grant program that will allow early stage researchers to generate
preliminary data to support competitive grant proposals related to neuroscience; 2) Fostering the
productivity, advancement, and retention of neuroscience researchers by providing a robust professional
development infrastructure to support publication of peer-reviewed articles, submission of grant proposals,
and development of strong professional networks; 3) Establish a framework for planning and preparation
of multi-investigator R01 and program project grants.
 We will leverage PI Harrington’s experience supporting the maturation of early stage faculty
through directing phase I and II of our COBRE Center, the institutional connections and mentoring
infrastructure that was developed as part of those awards, and the network of support for biomedical
researchers created by the IDeA-funded programs INBRE, CTR and COBREs. This Core will develop
both early stage investigators with the pilot grant program and established investigators by helping them
connect with potential collaborators and expand the scope of their research."

10927242,"Our overarching hypothesis is that chrono-timed exercise can restore rhythms in a misaligned central circadian clock. Despite the well-known benefits of exercise to overall health, limited studies have utilized exercise as a way to restore clock function, specifically in the SCN. Exercise can entrain peripheral clocks and elicit circadian phase-shifting effects but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In particular, the coordinating efforts of the SCN in such exercise-induced entrainment of peripheral clocks is not fully known. It has recently been reported that mid-afternoon exercise in humans can phase-shift the peripheral molecular clock, yet more studies are needed to determine how exercise can be a chronobiological tool for alleviating circadian misalignment, specifically in the SCN. Our lab utilizes a well-published rodent model of circadian disruption. In addition, coupling my expertise of exercise science with our established model of circadian disruption uniquely qualifies our lab to study this aim. This proposal will implement a disruption of the light cycle to mimic chronic circadian disruption as seen in humans. Exercise will then be implemented to test if a normal rhythm can be restored. In this pilot study, we propose to test our central hypothesis that exercise during circadian disruption will re-align a disrupted central circadian clock through one specific aim comprised of two experiments. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of how exercise restores proper circadian function during circadian disruption. Our preliminary evidence suggests that chrono-timed exercise during circadian disruption via continual light-dark cycle phase shifts results in a pattern of Fos expression (a marker of neuronal activation) that more closely resembles undisrupted mice compared to mice that did not exercise. Here we will examine the relationship of this restored Fos pattern to markers of specific SCN input pathways that are known to be associated with exercise-induced entrainment, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and serotonin (5HT). We will also examine the molecular mediators underlying such modulation using RNA-seq, to determine whether the receptors for these pathways are upregulated."
10917351,"Reading involves complex transformations of word forms, with visual input mapped to lexical, semantic and
phonological systems in less than a second. While much has been learned about the neuroanatomy of reading
from functional imaging and lesion studies, the dynamic and interactive properties of this system remain largely
unknown. We will investigate the rapid computations that allow us to convert from the visual input of a string of
letters to a known word with an associated sound and meaning using our established techniques for precise co-
localization and analysis of a large population intracranial recordings (75 patients), thus circumventing the sparse
sampling problems inherent to human intracranial experiments. In a series of experiments that systematically
vary different properties of written words and modulate what kind of linguistic information participants must attend
to, we will map the brain's global reading network for words. We will evaluate the neurocomputational architecture
across the ventral visual stream that allows us to rapidly identify written words, and probe dynamic interactions
with the broader reading network during a variety of behavioral tasks biasing lexical, phonological and semantic
processes. We will then use autoregressive models to derive metastable brain states during reading and
characterize dynamic network-level interactions during these stages and relate these to observable behavior.
elaborate on the roles of nodes of the reading network in word learning, we will track the modulations in the
distributed reading network that enable successful word learning. This will involve teaching patients new words
and examining the reading network's response changes over a number of days. Critical nodes and transitions in
network states derived from recordings will be validated using unifocal and multifocal direct cortical stimulation.
To accomplish our goals we have set up a large multicenter collaboration. Our team has proven expertise in all
aspects of language, reading, intracranial signal analysis, population level network modeling, and neural
networks. This work will dramatically improve our understanding of written language systems and develop new
ways to model neural computation. It will greatly enhance our understanding of dyslexia and language disorders
following brain injury or degeneration, with our experimental focus on word learning directly informing
neurobiological models of language."

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the
gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) (MIM 266600) and UC (MIM 191390) are the two main subtypes of
IBD. The NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established in July 2002 for
the purpose of identifying genetic variation predisposing to IBD. The Montreal-Boston Collaborative IBD
Genetic Research Center (GRC), is a founding member of the IBDGC. In the current proposal we have three
Specific Aims:
SA#1: To characterize the genetic architecture of IBD phenotypes within populations currently
underrepresented in IBD genomic research. OBJECTIVE: To employ local ancestry decomposition to
identify variants uniquely enriched in US admixed samples to identify previously overlooked genetic risk factors
contributing more substantially to IBD in Hispanic and African-American populations.
SA#2: To exploit longitudinal multi `omic approaches to reveal the biological causes of the clinical
heterogeneity of IBD and differential treatment response. OBJECTIVE: To recruit and prospectively
follow IBD patients following the initiation of molecularly-targeted therapies. We will generate and/or analyze
genetic, serum metabolomics, and blood single-cell RNA-sequencing data and test baseline samples
(immediately prior to initiation of therapy) and samples taken at first clinical assessment. Patients will be
followed for a period of one year.
SA#3: Analysis of the newly identified CD gene PDLIM5 and its splice region variant and their impact
on epithelial functions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the function of a newly identified CD gene and placing it
in the biological context of other IBD genes using patient-derived materials, organoids and hiPSC-based
models.
We are committed to including both sexes in our genetic and functional studies, including sex as a variable in
our data collection, analysis of results, and reporting of findings. This includes patient-derived cellular models
(e.g. hiPSC-derived lines). We will also ensure that the experiments are done on diverse genetic backgrounds
and determine if this impacts the effect of perturbation or baseline behavior of the assay and/or model."
10917356,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 34 million adults in the United States (~1 in 10) are living with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Diabetic peripheral
neuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication, affecting more than 50% of individuals with DM. People
with DPN display marked reductions in quality of life (QoL) and functional mobility. Consequences of DPN
include reduced sensation and feedback from the foot and lower limb and increased plantar pressures,
predisposing patients to ulcers and lower extremity amputation. We predict that persons with DPN who show
reduced functional mobility and walking speed, will have an associated reduction in propulsion during gait. Our
rationale for this work is that plantar pressure and propulsion are two key inter-related gait parameters that
contribute to ulceration, amputation risk, and reduced walking function in people with DPN, adversely
impacting QOL. Traditional gait training programs used to improve walking function may increase ulceration
risk, making these interventions unsuitable if not tailored for people with DPN. The goal of this proposal is to
elucidate the underlying biomechanical mechanisms contributing to the inter-relationships between plantar
pressure and propulsion in individuals with DPN, and to examine the safety and feasibility of using real-time
biofeedback to modify plantar pressure and propulsion during gait. To meet this goal, we propose to perform a
comprehensive biomechanical analysis including measurements of plantar pressure and propulsion, as well as
ankle kinematics, kinetics, and joint stiffness during walking. We will use plantar pressure and propulsion
biofeedback during walking as a probe to illuminate underlying biomechanical mechanisms of walking
dysfunction in people with DPN, while evaluating the individual-specific optimum dosage of biofeedback to
reduce plantar pressure while maintaining or enhancing propulsion. Additionally, we will conduct a preliminary
clinical trial to examine the feasibility and safety of using individualized real-time gait biofeedback as a gait
training method in individuals with DPN. The aims of this research plan proposal are to evaluate (1)
biomechanical mechanisms contributing to abnormal plantar pressure and propulsion during gait in individuals
with DPN; (2) biofeedback-induced changes in plantar pressure, propulsion, and biomechanics during gait in
individuals with DPN and age-similar controls; and (3) the acceptability, feasibility, safety, and preliminary
effects of gait training in individuals with DPN. Insights into the biomechanical mechanisms underlying plantar
pressure and propulsion in people with DPN will allow us to design more informed and effective gait
rehabilitation interventions aimed at preventing deleterious outcomes such as ulceration and amputation that
can be tailored to individual patient characteristics. The K01 training plan will prepare the PI with training in the
clinical disease processes of DM, mechanisms underlying gait dysfunction, gait biofeedback, and clinical trial
design. Consistent with the NIH mission, the long-term goals of this work are to enhance health, lengthen life,
and reduce the burden of illness and disability in people living with DM complications."
10917193,"Abstract
The goal of this project is to describe the function of synaptic adhesion molecules of the Neuroligin family
(Nlgns) in the mouse brain and in human neurons. Recent single cell expression studies have highlighted the
obversation that Nlgns are expressed also in non-neuronal cells, in particular oligodendrocyte precursors cells
(OPCs) and astrocytes who express Nlgns to even higher levels than neurons. Since little is known about the
function of Nlgns in glia and their effect on neurons and neural circuits, we propose to specifically delete Nlgns
in OPCs and astrocytes using our triple conditional Nlgn1-3 knock-out strain. Brains will be characterized
morphologically, electrophysiologically on the cellular and circuit level, and mutant mice will be characterized
by behavior. Next, we will perform an in-depth molecular characterization of the Neuroligin proteins by
characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying the surprising functional diversity of Nlgns. We will map
their functional domains in mouse neurons by expressing various domain-mutant proteins in Nlgn1-4 quadruple
knock-out cells. We will explore whether Nlgn sequence relates to functional specificity and investigate the
notion of a synaptic Neurexin “code” that may determine Nlgn specificity.
 To complement our mouse studies and explore human-specific Neuroligin function as well as human
disease-associated mutations, we will capitalize on our previous human stem cell and reprogramming work in
which we have developed human induced neuronal (iN) cells that exhibit all principal functional properties of
primary mouse neurons including robust synapse formation. We propose to utilize this system to investigate
the so far obscure function of NLGN4Y, a Y chromosomal gene closely related to NLGN4 on the X-
chromosome and a member of the family not present in mouse. We will assess subcellular targeting by tagging
the endogenous locus and assess the functional consequences of genetic deletion. Another frequently mutated
Nlgn gene is NLGN3. Unlike NLGN4 it is better conserved in mice, but almost nothing is known about its
function in human cells. In addition to generate loss-of-function alleles, we will study the functional
consequences of distinct ASD-associated mutations introduced into the human NLGN3 gene. We will use a
conditional mutagenesis approach as we have successfully done in the past, as it allows the generation of a
perfect control conidition derived from the identical cell line as the experimental condition. Mutant human
neurons and controls will be characterized biochemically, morphologically, by gene expression, and
electrophysiologically. Finally, we propose to investigate the role of the proposed Nlgns-modulators MDGAs
which are also found mutated in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We will assess their
requirement for proper synapse formation and function by generating loss-of-function alleles in human
neurons. We will further probe their function as Neuroligin modulators as competitive Nlgn binding molecules."
10917363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Twenty percent of US women with breast cancer also have diabetes mellitus (DM) and face a 50% higher risk
of death up to 10 years after cancer diagnosis compared to non-diabetic women with breast cancer. A possible
explanation is that DM receives less attention during cancer treatments because patients, oncologists, and
primary care providers (PCPs) prioritize cancer care over DM management. Oncologists may focus on cancer
care (rather than DM management), patients may not see their PCPs in the period after cancer diagnosis, and
PCPs may not feel comfortable managing DM in the context of chemotherapy regimens that frequently affect
glucose control. Given these concerns, identifying a provider who could effectively manage DM may be an
attractive solution. Nurse practitioners (NPs) have been successfully integrated into many oncology care teams
to support general cancer care. Separately, NPs have been shown to successfully manage DM in various non-
cancer settings. However, no study has determined whether a NP on the oncology care team can effectively
manage DM during chemotherapy for breast cancer. I hypothesize that a NP trained in DM care and
embedded in the oncology team can effectively manage DM during this acute phase of breast cancer care.
The objective of this study is to engage stakeholders to develop and implement a NP-led intervention to
manage DM for women receiving chemotherapy for incident non-metastatic breast cancer. To accomplish this,
I propose the following research aims: 1) elicit the perspectives of patients, NPs, oncologists, and PCPs about
barriers to and facilitators for a NP managing DM during chemotherapy, 2) develop a NP-led intervention to
manage DM during chemotherapy, and 3) conduct a pilot study to implement the intervention and assess
implementation outcomes (reach, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity). Findings from this pilot
study will lay the groundwork for a multi-site, randomized trial testing the effectiveness of this NP-led model.
As a PhD-trained health services researcher focused on cancer outcomes and health disparities, I have gained
quantitative research expertise. I now seek to expand my research skills to include implementation trials. To
accomplish this goal, I will pursue mentorship and training in qualitative research methods, healthcare delivery,
and in stakeholder-engaged intervention design, implementation, and evaluation in real-world settings. I will be
mentored by two nationally-recognized clinician scientists, Dr. Monika Safford and Dr. Lisa Kern. Together, we
designed a career development plan for me to gain skills through coursework and reading that is then solidified
through experiential learning by carrying out my research aims. This Award will enable me to advance toward
my long-term goal of becoming an independent health services researcher working at the intersection of
cancer care, primary care, and health equity to improve patient outcomes and reduce health disparities."
10917365,"Project Summary/Abstract
Therapies against immunologic checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1, have revolutionized the treatment of multiple
malignancies, such as malignant melanoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, or gastroesophageal cancer. All of these
therapies depend on predictive biomarker assays for PD-L1 protein expression in tumor tissue to identify patients who
will most likely respond. PD-L1 assays face two significant challenges: (i) they often need to be performed on small tissue
biopsies where tumor tissue is limited and (ii) the threshold for positivity by immunohistochemistry (1%) is very small,
highlighting crucial dependence on utmost precision and pre-analytical sample validity.
To address the issue of small and limited samples in biopsies, we have developed a chromogenic multiplexed
immunohistochemical assay that combines PD-L1 assessment with tissue and cell type-specific markers to provide a
combined diagnostic and predictive assay on a single histologic slide. To move multiplexed assays around PD-L1 into the
clinic, there exists an important knowledge gap: what are the patient-specific factors and specimen-related pre-analytical
variables that can influence the readout of PD-L1 positivity? Very limited knowledge is available about these variables.
Importantly, because the PD-L1 positivity threshold is so low and requires the reliable separation of two very small
numbers (<1% vs. ≥1%), even minute pre-analytical variabilities would be expected to have significant negative impact on
assay validity. In that respect, PD-L1 testing in tissue is particularly in need of extensive characterization and control of
pre-analytical variability, even more so than other assays whose cut-off points lie in more favorable ranges.
Our proposal is based on the hypothesis that both patient-specific factors (such as molecular features of the cancer,
current immune status, prior drug therapy, etc.) and specimen-related factors (such as timing of biopsy, size of tissue,
ischemic time, fixation protocol, etc.) can significantly influence subsequent biomarker measurements. We further
hypothesize that solid knowledge about these influences will allow controlling for and mitigating patient-specific and
specimen-related effects and will lead to more accurate and valid biomarker assessment. Aim 1: We will create a cohort
to test the influence of patient-specific context factors. We will make use of our extensive immuno-oncology database
and biobank of >5,000 patients. Aim 2: We will test how specimen-related pre-analytical variables affect the assay using
a wide variety of fresh, frozen, and formalin fixed tissue types and sizes. Aim 3: Once we have defined optimal patient-
specific and specimen-related procedures, we will validate our multiplex assay in a prospective cohort of immunotherapy
patients at MSKCC.
Significance: This project will yield abundant data about the pre-analytical variables that influence a PD-L1 multiplex
immunohistochemistry assay. These data will inform optimal specimen acquisition and handling and strategies for
avoiding or mitigating inaccurate assay results. Innovation: This will be the first study to systematically explore both
patient context factors and specimen pre-analytics in multiplexed immunohistochemical testing for immuno-oncology.
Our close collaboration with commercial test developers as part of our research team will accelerate the translation of
our scientific findings into optimized assays for the direct benefit of patients."
10917067,"Chromatin, the assemblage of protein, DNA and RNA that represents the physiologic
form of the eukaryotic genome, imposes a million-fold length-scale compaction to fit
DNA in the nucleus. Rather than serving as mere static packaging, chromatin structure
acts as a dynamic regulator of underlying DNA function. Local chromatin structure may
be stable for decades, yet is sufficiently dynamic to respond to signaling pathways,
potentiating transcriptional program changes in development, disease, and
environmental changes. Indeed, cellular identity and changes thereof are intimately
connected to chromatin states-- keeping a neuron a neuron and not a liver cell. Apart
from DNA sequence-specific transcription factors, the information carriers responsible
for this structural variation are chemical modifications to the genome itself and attendant
histone proteins involved in packaging (often referred to as “epigenetic” marks), as well
as noncoding RNA acting at the chromatin interface. Although little known about these
epigenetic information carriers, it is clear that they play crucial roles in development,
cognition and disease. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which epigenetic
information carriers impact chromatin structure and function, particularly in the context
of transcriptional activation is the unifying theme of the Ruthenburg lab. In the next four
years, we will discover and characterize the detailed mechanisms of new epigenetic
information carriers, focusing on nucleosome-level variation and orphaned histone
modifications, defining binding partners for recently appreciated DNA modifications and
their function, and performing detailed mechanistic characterization of a class of
molecules we discovered--chromatin-enriched noncoding RNA that act as local
transcriptional activators. In addition, we will biochemically define the function of RNA in
the MLL/SET1 family of histone modification complexes and its functional
consequences in cellular contexts. Our interdisciplinary work in these areas will require
the development of new tools and experimental approaches—our outstanding track
record of pioneering tool development with NIGMS funding makes the case that future
efforts will meet with similar success. The fundamental mechanistic understanding of
epigenetic information systems we will develop through these avenues will impact our
understanding of nuclear function and its dysregulation in disease."
10917071,"Project Summary
One of the most fundamental challenges in cell biology is understanding how cells migrate in three-
dimensional extracellular matrices (ECM) at specific times and to specific locations. Cell migration helps shape
all tissues and organs during development and the disruption of the normal mechanisms that normally control
migration dramatically enhance the lethality of cancers. Our recent studies identified members of Rab40 sub-
family as important regulators of cell migration. Rab proteins are the largest family of small monomeric
GTPases belonging to the Ras oncogene superfamily. Among them, Rab40 sub-family is unique because it
contains a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box located at the C-terminal end of the protein.
Importantly, we and others have shown that Rab40 sub-family of proteins bind to Cullin5 via the SOCS box to
form a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that regulate various aspects of cell migration in vitro and in vivo.
Consequently, Rab40 proteins emerged as important coordinators between membrane trafficking, cytoskeleton
dynamics and cell signaling, and understanding the molecular machinery governing functions of Rab40 sub-
family during cell migration is a major focus of this proposal. In all vertebrates Rab40 family consists of two
members, Rab40b and Rab40c. Our recent work has shown that Rab40b and Rab40c are important for
targeted secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, as well as regulation of actin dynamics during breast cancer
migration, invasion and metastasis. We also have shown that Rab40b/Cullin5 complex mediate ubiquitylation
of several regulators of cell migration, including Rap2, while Rab40c/Cullin5 mediates protein phosphatase 6
(PP6) complex ubiquitylation and inactivation. Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize
that Rab40b and Rab40c mediate coordination between signaling, membrane trafficking, and actin
dynamics during cell migration. The following aims are designed to test this hypothesis by combining of the
unique expertise from Dr. Rytis Prekeris (Rab GTPases and actin dynamics), Dr. Kristin Artinger (zebrafish and
neural crest cell migration), and Dr. Traci Lyons (breast cancer). First, we will define the roles of
Rab40b/Cullin5 and Rap2 complexes in regulating membrane and actin dynamics during cell migration by
mapping Rab40b-dependent Rap2 ubiquitylation sites and dissecting how Rap2 regulates actin and focal
adhesion site dynamics at the leading edge and/or invadopodia. Second, we will elucidate the roles of
Rab40c/Cullin5-PP6 complex in regulating signaling during cell migration. To that end, we will use protein
binding assays in combination with protein mutagenesis and various microscopy approaches to determine
biochemical properties of PP6 binding to Rab40c and the consequences of this binding on PP6 complex
stability and activity. Third, we will determine the functions of Rab40b/Cullin5-Rap2 and Rab40c/Cullin5-PP6
pathways during neural crest cell migration in vivo using zebrafish since zebrafish model allows direct and real-
time in vivo analysis of cell migration."
10917196,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 Astrocytes play a crucial role in regulating the structure, physiology, and plasticity of neural circuits. The
visual critical period provides an experimentally tractable paradigm in which to better understand how astrocytic
factors can precisely modulate plasticity in cortical circuits. The critical period is a stereotyped developmental
period during which proper visual experience is essential for the normal establishment of cortical circuits. As
manipulations of visual input during the critical period lead to well-described cortical remodeling and lasting
changes, these paradigms can be used to study the role of astrocytic factors in this form of plasticity. Cyr61 is a
potential key astrocytic plasticity-regulating factor, as its mRNA expression increases throughout development
and decreases after plasticity manipulations, suggesting it may be an “anti-plasticity” factor acting to restrict
plasticity in adulthood. In Aim 1, the role of Cyr61 during the critical period will be examined by overexpressing
it selectively in astrocytes in the mouse visual cortex. Mice will undergo monocular deprivation which typically
results in cortical remodeling. Electrophysiology and in vivo imaging will be performed to assess remodeling
differences between Cyr61 overexpressing and control mice. If Cyr61 is inhibiting plasticity, then overexpressing
Cyr61 during the critical period is expected to reduce plasticity in response to monocular deprivation. Aim 2 asks
if reducing the expression of Cyr61 in adulthood is sufficient to re-open the critical period for plasticity. To address
this adult transgenic mice with Cyr61 knockout selectively in astrocytes will undergo monocular deprivation, and
plasticity assessed in the same way as Aim 1. If Cyr61 is inhibiting adult plasticity, then removing it from adult
astrocytes is predicted to increase the remodeling response to monocular deprivation. To determine how CYR61
regulates plasticity, Aim 3 uses mass spectrometry to identify binding partners of CYR61 protein. This will
contribute to understanding the mechanism of action and will provide future avenues of investigation. The goal
of these experiments is to examine whether specific astrocytic factors are necessary and sufficient to modulate
critical period plasticity. This research proposal has important implications for understanding how to promote
synaptic repair and circuit rewiring after neurological disease, damage, or developmental disruptions.
 The research and training plan will take place at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where there are
multiple opportunities for postdoctoral researchers to enhance their training experience. The Salk Institute hosts
a series of research seminars in which postdoctoral scholars both have the opportunity to interact with outside
faculty and to present their own research. Moreover, the proposed training plan will include weekly meetings with
the Sponsor to maintain progress, writing review papers, participating in peer review, and weekly laboratory
meetings in which a lab member presents data and obtains experimental and critical feedback from the entire
lab."
10917072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alcohol misuse, sexual assault, and psychological distress (anxiety, depression) are significant
interconnected problems among bisexual women. Heavy drinking is a primary risk factor for sexual victimization
and increases risk for revictimization. Bisexual women report higher rates of heavy episodic drinking compared
to heterosexual women, as well as higher rates of sexual assault compared to heterosexual or lesbian women.
Bisexual women also report higher levels of minority stress, lower levels of connection to the LGBTQ+
community, and greater psychological distress (anxiety, depression) compared to lesbian women. Taken
together, there is a strong need to target alcohol use, sexual assault, and psychological distress among bisexual
women. Problematically, existing integrated alcohol and sexual assault interventions do not consider the unique
stressors (minority stress, disconnection from the LGBTQ+ community) faced by bisexual women. Bisexual
women also report less benefit from existing prevention approaches interventions. An integrated alcohol and
sexual assault prevention program specifically tailored to bisexual women is therefore warranted. The proposed
research will develop an intervention targeted toward bisexual college women between the ages of 18 – 30 with
a history of sexual victimization who report heavy episodic drinking, a particularly high-risk group. The
intervention will integrate (a) evidence-based motivational interviewing with personalized feedback to address
risky alcohol use, (b) mindfulness skills training to reduce psychological distress, and (c) sexual assault risk
reduction and resistance education as well as bystander intervention skills training with the goal of decreasing
revictimization. Following a Stage 1A and 1B treatment development model, in Stage 1A information from
informant interviews (N = 10), three focus groups (N = 30), stakeholder interviews (N = 6), and a campus advisory
board will guide the development of the integrated intervention. The integrated intervention will be tested in an
open trial (N = 20) in which interview and self-report methods will be utilized to gather information regarding the
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention will be revised and then evaluated in a Stage 1B
randomized pilot trial involving 90 women assigned to the proposed intervention or a wait list control group.
Women will be followed at 2- and 4- months post-baseline. In the Revision Phase, we will conduct exit interviews
and revise the intervention to prepare for a larger clinical trial. Results of this research are expected to inform
the development of interventions that not only target the intersection of alcohol use and sexual assault among
bisexual college women, but also promote the overall wellbeing of bisexual women. This integrated approach
represents a shift in how these public health problems are typically addressed and has the potential for significant
impact across several cross-cutting outcomes."

Mozambique has made considerable strides in its national HIV response, specifically in its progress towards
the lofty UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals. Yet, despite this progress, significant gaps persist, including numerous
incident infections, large numbers of persons living with HIV (PLWH) unaware of their status, and challenges in
achieving viral load suppression in certain groups. Further, the country is yet to optimally leverage newer data-
driven and genetics-based approaches for personalized HIV care, and for molecular epidemiology of the
disease. To address these gaps, Mozambique must build its biomedical informatics (BMI) research capacity.
BMI focuses on using computational and information sciences approaches in biology (primarily genomics and
proteomics) and health disciplines (primarily clinical & public health).
Leveraging proven leadership and expertise as Mozambique’s lead HIV Strategic Information partner and
highly successful partnerships between Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) and Vanderbilt University
Medical Center (VUMC), we propose the Vanderbilt-Mozambique Biomedical Informatics (VM-BMI)
Training and Research program. The VM-BMI is designed to sustainably equip Mozambican scientists with
skills to advance progress towards HIV epidemic control through high-quality BMI-based research that is
relevant to the country. To build such capacity and accomplish this objective, we propose the following three
Specific Aims:
 1) Train six Mozambican faculty fellows in BMI to build UEM’s capacity for a self-sustaining HIV-focused
 BMI research portfolio. This multi-faceted BMI training will occur during Year 1 and Year 2 of the program.
 2) Develop and implement a BMI track within the existing master’s in informatics program at UEM. Given
 that this is a new program and faculty expertise and capacity needs to be established/expanded,
 implementation and enrollment of students into this new BMI track will begin in Year 3 of the program.
 3) Conduct annual HIV-related BMI workshops and bootcamps at UEM to provide BMI research training
 and practical experience addressing HIV-relevant research questions in Mozambique (targeting 20
 individuals per year for each workshop and bootcamp for a total 200 trainees in five years).
To our knowledge, this will not only be the first BMI training program in Mozambique, but also the first in all
Portuguese-speaking (Lusophone) countries in Africa, training upwards of 216 trainees. At the end of the 5-
year VM-BMI program, we will have equipped UEM to: (a) lead a fully-fledged BMI-based HIV research
portfolio, (b) support a full BMI master’s program, and (c) better address the HIV epidemic in the country."
10912657,"Summary: Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization can make it difficult to procure compatible RBCs for future
transfusion, which can directly increase morbidity and mortality in transfusion-dependent individuals. While
patients who develop multiple alloantibodies against distinct alloantigens are particularly challenging to manage,
the immune events during initial alloimmunization that may increase the likelihood of generating additional
alloantibodies following subsequent transfusion remain unknown. Our long-term goal is to identify immune
factors that enhance subsequent alloimmunization events in previously alloimmunized individuals in order to
prevent the accumulation of multiple alloantibodies in transfusion dependent individuals. Our central hypothesis
is that initial alloimmunization events directly enhance subsequent RBC alloimmunization by inducing CD4 T
cells that possess the ability to directly activate B cells against a completely unrelated RBC alloantigen following
subsequent transfusion. Our hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our recent discovery that B cells specific
for one antigen (the HOD (HEL, OVA and Duffy) antigen) not only internalize HOD following RBC engagement,
but likewise remove and internalize additional RBC components, suggesting that B cells may possess the ability
to remove multiple antigens following engagement of the target antigen. Consistent with this, adoptive transfer
of CD4 T cells primed by KEL RBC transfusion in the presence of poly I:C, which induces viral-like inflammation,
directly enhances alloantibody formation against the completely distinct HOD antigen following subsequent
transfusion of RBCs expressing HOD and KEL. Depletion of marginal zone (MZ) B cells, a unique B cell
population previously shown to be critical in the initiation of alloantibodies, inhibits KEL RBC priming and the
HOD RBC boost following HOD x KEL RBC transfusion, suggesting that MZ B cells work in concert with
previously recognized bridging channel 33D1+ dendritic cells (33D1+ DCs) shown to be critical in the initial
activation of CD4 T cells following HOD RBC transfusion. In contrast, while KEL RBC-induced alloimmunization
requires type I interferons (IFNab) and HOD RBC-induced alloimmunization requires toll-like receptor (TLR)
signaling, KEL-induced alloimmunization in the presence of PIC requires both IFNab and TLRs, suggesting that
while innate immune pathways may differ for KEL and HOD RBC-induced alloimmunization, PIC allows KEL
RBCs to engage TLRs and prime a subsequent HOD boost. We will use a series of pre-clinical models to define
the key priming and subsequent boosting pathways by testing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Define the role
of MZ B cells, 33D1+ DCs, IFNab and TLRs in PIC/KEL RBC-induced priming. Aim 2: Define the role of MZ B
cells, 33D1+ DCs, and TLRs in subsequent KEL-mediated HOD RBC boost. We think that successful completion
of these aims will define key immunological priming and boosting events that facilitate alloimmunization and
therefore will provide an important framework to develop rational approaches to prevent the development of RBC
alloantibodies against multiple alloantigens in chronically transfused individuals."

10912696,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common form of interstitial lung disease (ILD), resulting in alveolar
remodeling and progressive loss of pulmonary function, respiratory failure, and death often within 5 years of
diagnosis. Genetic and experimental evidence support the concept that chronic alveolar epithelial injury and
failure to properly repair the respiratory epithelium are intrinsic to IPF disease pathogenesis. Histologically,
respiratory epithelial cells in the lung parenchyma are replaced by cells which are normally restricted to
conducting airways. Fibrotic lesions and honeycomb structures replace alveoli, the latter normally lined by
alveolar type 1 (AT1) and AT2 cells. Acute exacerbations by respiratory viral infections are the most devastating
complication of IPF, having an in-hospital mortality rate of greater than 50%. Data from previous coronavirus
pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),
as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic
consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the causative agent of COVID-19. Interestingly, the major risk
factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), namely increasing age, male
sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. Although many patients who develop acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survive the acute phase of the illness, a substantial proportion die as a
result of progressive pulmonary fibrosis. It remains unclear why certain individuals are able to recover from
ARDS, whereas in others there is a shift to unchecked cellular proliferation with the accumulation of BC-pods,
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. In these patients, there is also excessive deposition of collagen alongside other
components of the extracellular matrix resulting in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Distinct epithelial
stem/progenitor cell pools and/or their mesenchymal niches repopulate injured tissue depending on the extent
and type of injury, and the outcomes of regeneration or fibrosis in response to severe alveolar epithelial injury is
dependent in part on the dynamics of cell competition between these cell populations. In tissues harboring a
mosaic imbalance in cMyc or Yap protein levels, cells with higher cMyc or nuclear Yap levels become super-
competitors and expand at the expense of cells with lower levels, by eliminating them. Alternatively, if certain
stem cell populations are selectively wiped out due to the type of injury, other stem cell populations that escape
the injury and which may not be so adept at replacing the destroyed tissue will now have a competitive
advantage. For example, SARS-CoV-2 enters respiratory epithelial cells via its receptor, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), causing severe airway and alveolar epithelial injury. Based on Ace2 expression, distinct
stem/progenitor cell pools appear to be differentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This grant proposal
seeks to manipulate the underlying mechanisms of cell competition to help prevent and treat IPF and ARDS.
Cell competition might also be exploited to maximize the potential of healthy tissue replacement."

This longitudinal, mixed methods study investigates the relationship between disaster-related stressors, social
determinants of health, and health outcomes among HIV-positive people who use drugs (PWUD) in Ukraine
and the strategies that health and social service providers have adopted to maintain access to care. In
Ukraine, people who use drugs (PWUD) and live with HIV are a vulnerable population and PWUD are a key
population in Ukraine’s HIV epidemic, with at least 38% of all people with a new HIV diagnosis and at least
50% of all people living with HIV (PLWH) indicating injection drug use as the route of transmission. Russia’s
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 precipitated massive immediate and potentially long-term
disruptions to all aspects of daily life in Ukraine, with unknown consequences for HIV-positive PWUD. Russia’s
war on Ukraine is both a disaster and a form of mass trauma that involves widespread destruction, loss of life,
and psychological distress for those directly and indirectly affected by it. The impact of mass traumas may
have disproportionately negative consequences for already vulnerable populations, including those who are
economically precarious and socially marginalized. Social determinants of health—the social conditions and
economic circumstances that influence health—are key contributors to HIV care and treatment outcomes. The
specific aims of this study are: (1) 1. To measure the effects of disaster-related stressors (personal,
interpersonal, and environmental) and mediating effects of SDOH and adaptation on primary clinical outcomes
of HIV care engagement, ART adherence, and viral suppression and secondary outcomes of drug treatment
engagement and risky substance use in a longitudinal cohort followed up to 3 years; (2) To qualitatively
characterize at baseline and longitudinally the effects of conflict on social determinants of health and
adaptation trajectories of HIV-positive PWUD; and (3) To explore how service providers who work with PWUD
and PLWH modify policies and practices in the context of supply chain disruptions, workforce depletion, and
population displacement to promote continued care engagement. This project will use an innovative
instrumental variables approach to assess how mass trauma and resulting changes to SDOH causally affect
substance use and HIV outcomes and link these findings to structural and resources changes that resulted
from the war. This approach will leverage a natural experiment in which residence in areas of Ukraine most
affected by the war (proximal to the frontlines) approximates a random assignment to mass trauma exposure.
Identifying how people remain connected to HIV and substance use care in contexts of disruption and the
strategies that health care and social service providers use to keep people engaged have potential broad
transferability. The immediate and longer-term consequences of mass trauma for HIV outcomes are unknown.
Identifying how people remain connected to HIV care in contexts of disruption and the strategies that health

Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. It is critical to detect it early as skin
cancers, especially melanoma, can be cured by surgery alone if detected early. As digital technology improves,
skin cancer detection, and especially automated skin cancer detection, is increasingly being performed over
images either in person or remotely via teledermatology. While artificial intelligence (AI) for skin cancer
detection exceeds human performance on static images, algorithm performance on representative, multimodal
data is still underdeveloped due to data collected piecemeal with different devices, without consistent image
acquisition standards or automated registration. A well-curated dataset of annotated skin images helps meet a
unique need beyond machine learning, as primary care clinicians also require expertly annotated images for
education and training. We will overcome the lack of imaging standards and disparate data sources
problematic in dermatology imaging by developing automated ingestion, organization, registration, and curation
pipeline to improve AI for skin cancer detection.
The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive includes over 2,500 citations, 156,000 images, 100
daily users, and 5 AI grand challenges with over 3,500 participants. The ISIC archive is built upon the open-
source, NCI- supported, open-source web-based data management platform, Girder. The Girder platform is
highly flexible, and has been extended to multiple applications (e.g., pathology, radiology).
The flexibility of the Girder platform will enable us to address four major barriers that prevent our ability
to efficiently ingest, host and serve large amounts of multidimensional data at the scale of non-medical image
repositories (e.g. ImageNet): (1) need for laborious expert data curation and quality assurance review for
protected health information, imaging artifacts, and incorrect labels (SA1.1); (2) limited metadata without
content-based features creating cumbersome image retrieval (SA1.2); (3) lack of multimodal viewing
capabilities (SA2); and (4) inadequate integration to existing AI and annotation software, preventing flexible,
hypothesis-driven experimentation (SA3).
The proposed informatics project aimed at data ingestion, multimodal visualization, and organization through
ML and computer vision-based automation build on the initial success of the International Skin Imaging
Collaboration (ISIC) Archive and the Girder platform upon which it is built. They will enable scaling of the
Archive to millions of images, enabling multimodal experimentation with registered reflectance confocal
microscopy images, and nimbly facilitate AI and translational experimentation for improved skin cancer
detection."
10911119,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rhinosinusitis (RS) is one of the most prevalent airway diseases, effecting approximately 15% of the U.S
population. With symptoms of sinonasal mucus hypersecretion and plugging, severe facial pain and breathing
difficulties, RS significantly affects both quality of life and socioeconomic burden. Despite these dire outcomes,
the etiology of RS is completely unknown, severely hampering the development of preventative or curative
treatments.
This proposal investigates how aberrant patterning in the organs that provide the majority of the mucus, the
nasal submucosal glands (SMGs), may be causative for chronic RS (CRS, > 12 weeks). Based on the high
penetrance of CRS in patients with mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
gene (Cystic Fibrosis) and published and preliminary studies showing aberrant SMG morphology and function
are common to this disease, this proposal tests the hypothesis that dysfunction in CFTR leads to aberrant SMG
patterning and thus, CRS. This hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims. (1) Define cell identities and
lineage dynamics during SMG development. Before molecular and cellular mechanisms of aberrant gland
architecture can be understood, appreciation of normal SMG development is essential. In this Aim, transcriptomic
techniques and quantitative measures of morphological changes will be employed to uncover processes
governing human SMG development, which can then be utilized to delineate mechanisms of disease SMG
patterning. (2) Elucidate CFTR dysfunction in SMGs as an underlying cause of CRS. This Aim will combine
use of animal models and ex vivo human SMG manipulation, to test the hypothesis that mis-regulation in CFTR
is a cause of tissue remodeling and CRS. (3) Identify molecular and cellular signatures of SMG remodeling
in human adult CRS. This final aim will examine morphological and transcriptomic gland phenotypes common
to healthy, non-CF CRS, and CF CRS patients, providing insight into alterations in gland structure and function,
and thus contribution to CRS.
To ensure experiment completion, training in new techniques will be carried out in the K99 phase, including 3D
imaging, RNA sequencing and organoid culture. Interactions with collaborators and members of an advisory
committee, and attendance of workshops and seminars, will also support project completion and career
development. If successful, the proposed research will not only expand our knowledge on SMG development
and biology, but will also provide targets for novel therapeutics to be tested in patients of CRS."

The long-term goals of the proposed research are to elucidate mechanisms of three-dimensional genome
architecture in the control of neuronal connectivity in the brain. It has recently been found that physiological
stimuli including sensory experience or developmental signals remodel neuronal genome architecture in vivo.
Strikingly, it's found that long-distance genome interactions massively increase in the developing
cerebellum in mice. The discovery of these long-distance interactions formed between genes critical for
neuronal differentiation unveils novel nuclear mechanisms by which genome architecture may play a role in the
wiring of the brain. These findings raise fundamental questions on the mechanisms and biological functions of
these interactions in the brain, which will be addressed in this grant. First, the organizing principles of
long-distance genome interactions in the brain will be elucidated. Based on the in vivo findings, the
hypothesis that long-distance genomic interactions are organized by specific epigenetic and
transcriptional features will be tested. In addition, the study will also test the hypothesis that
anchors of long-distance interactions assemble into higher-ordered subnuclear structures including
nuclear speckles or Mediator condensates, which function as transcriptionally active hubs. Second, the
projcet will define mechanisms by which long-distance interactions are formed in development. The BAF
chromatin remodeling complex alters the genome environment to activate or repress transcription and is
required for brain development in mice and humans, and its dysregulation results in human
neurodevelopmental disorders, including Coffin–Siris syndrome and autism. Based on our preliminary
findings, the hypothesis that the BAF complex transiently inhibits formation of long-distance genome
interactions in immature neurons of the developing brain will be tested. Following early development, the
inhibition of the long-distance interactions might be relieved by the recruitment of specific sets of
transcription factors that drive terminal neuron differentiation. This project will test the hypothesis that these
transcription regulators, identified using DNA motif analyses, promote the formation of the long-distance
genome interactions. Finally, this study will also test the hypothesis that the formation of long-distance
genome interactions is necessary for the maturation of neurons in vivo, including making proper
connections with their pre- and post-synaptic partners. The proposed research is significant as it will
advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating genome architecture to control
neuronal differentiation in mammalian brain. Furthermore, these studies will provide an integrated view
on how genome folding in the nucleus orchestrates the assembly of neural circuits underlying behavior."
10911241,"Project Summary / Abstract
Genetic variation among individuals shapes important phenotypes, including the risk for common human
diseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological disease. In particular, regulatory genetic
variation causes inter-individual differences in gene expression. The resulting gene expression differences
account for a substantial portion of variation in many genetically complex traits.
In spite of the critical importance of regulatory variation, many fundamental questions remain open. First,
most DNA differences in a given genome likely have no effect. The nature of the specific variants that do
have effects remains poorly understood. Second, genetic variation can specifically affect the protein
abundance of a given gene without altering the abundance of the mRNA of the same gene. The
mechanisms that are responsible for these protein-specific effects remain unclear. Third, we only have a
crude understanding of how the differences in gene expression that result from regulatory variation affect
organismal phenotypes.
Over the next five years, research in my laboratory will focus on addressing these critical gaps in
knowledge. Specifically, we seek to identify and characterize causal DNA variants, study the impact of
genetic variation on protein degradation, and examine quantitatively how the precise abundance of a given
gene can shape organismal traits. Our work combines computational biology, quantitative and statistical
genetics with experimental genome-wide approaches. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a
powerful and tractable model system for regulatory variation, while pursuing related approaches in human
cells.
Our long-term vision is to improve our understanding of regulatory variation to the point at which it becomes
possible to accurately predict the consequences of the DNA variants in an individual’s genome. This ability
will be valuable for fundamental research and personalized approaches for improving human health."
10911312,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Detailed information about the state of a cell, e.g., its lineage, mitotic history, proliferation potential, and functional
competence, consolidates through epigenetic modifications of its DNA and chromatin. Among these
modifications, DNA methylation has been widely studied and profiled to dissect tissue heterogeneity, disease
cell of origin, and implement liquid biopsy-based disease diagnosis, thanks to its chemical stability and genome-
wide distribution. Compared to bulk tissue methylome assays, which yield convoluted, hard-to-decipher signals
from thousands to millions of cells, single-cell DNA methylome profiling is advantageous in cell identity-related
applications. Despite the rapid increase in the volume and variety of single-cell DNA methylome data in recent
years, availability of powerful and easy-to-use computational tools for their analyses is still an unmet demand.
Consensus on the optimal strategy of interpreting cell states based on single-cell methylome data has not been
reached. My lab’s long-term goal is to elucidate epigenetic cell identities at the single-cell level in humans and
mice. Towards that goal, I propose to develop a suite of computational tools, for analyzing single-cell methylation
data, that will encompass functions for data preprocessing, quality control, imputation, methylome signature
extraction, cell state annotation, and exploratory visualization. These software tools will be engineered to be
efficient, modular, and will be designed to operate both in high-performance computing environments and on
basic laptops. These tools would be able to alert the investigator of potential data quality issues, feedback to
accelerate methylation assay development, and discover biological links between the DNA methylome and the
cell’s genetic makeup, mitotic history, cell-cycle stage, differentiation capacity, and functional state. They can
also be used to study cell population traits in bulk tissue samples. Together with these computational tools, we
also aim to distribute a cell-type-resolution reference methylome catalog to benefit the research community. My
proposed work will deliver computational tools and methylation references to deepen our understanding of the
role of DNA methylation in determining cell lineages and provide practical tools for epigenetic cell typing. The
methods to be developed could be readily plugged into exploratory and translational applications in broader
biomedical contexts."
10911780,"While studies support the efficacy of comprehensive, school-wide interventions in reducing bullying, these
types of programs can require significant time and financial resources for implementation, resulting in barriers
to providing school-based bullying prevention, especially in low-income and rural communities. Additionally,
although training bystanders to act as “defenders” on behalf of targets of bullying is an important intervention
component, few programs include this as part of their comprehensive strategy. Brief programs that focus on
bystander training and require fewer resources are needed to reduce bullying and its negative consequences.
The PI (Dr. Midgett) developed STAC, a brief, stand-alone bullying bystander intervention for middle school
students, to reduce bullying and mental health risks for bystanders. Brief, in-person programs, however, still
pose implementation barrier such as training school personnel, providing external support, and not allowing for
large groups of students to be trained at the same time. For this project, we propose to develop a technology-
based STAC intervention (STAC-T) that will allow students to customize their experience by selecting avatars
and bullying scenarios based on our previous studies conducted in a range of middle schools, including those
in low-income and rural communities. We will also incorporate an assessment and personalized feedback
component to promote behavior change. The innovative, user-centered design proposed will be inherently
sensitive to cultural needs of students and identify personally-appropriate strategies. The specific aims of this
application include building the program leveraging our prior work and expertise of an external advisory board,
usability and effectiveness testing with middle school students and stakeholders to evaluate feasibility, and
testing the efficacy of the program with a randomized controlled trial. The technology-based platform will
increase the overall reach, impact, and sustainability of the STAC intervention for bullying prevention. It will
substantially reduce cost to increase reach and its interactivity and algorithms can tailor program content to
adapt it further for students attending low-income and rural schools. Thus, this low-cost, easy to disseminate
technology-based bullying bystander intervention has the potential to have a substantial impact on the problem
of bullying and the negative associated consequences for both students who are targets and bystanders in
middle school when the problem of bullying peaks. There is a large market for the STAC-T intervention with
approximately 100,000 public and private schools with middle-school grades in the United States. Globally, the
online education market is growing at 10% a year and the digital health market exceeds $220 billion annually."
10911792,"This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator
at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision
phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected
in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not
inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a
critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology
and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational
study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without
guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine
profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that
inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in
PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the
assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand
PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic
implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield,
UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic
phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will
integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific
mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific
signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public
repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune
modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could
help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker
discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to
transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives
are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate
collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed
team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene
Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific
advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics])."

declining number of physicians choosing research careers. The proposed University of Illinois Short-Term
Research Training Program (SRTP) will provide first year medical students (12 slots in Year 1, 15 in Year 2-5)
with a 10-week mentored research experience in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK) mission areas including, kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases; digestive disease and
nutrition; and diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic disease. The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UI
COM) is a large public medical school with one of the most diverse student populations in the country in terms
of enrolled African American and Latino students. The program will draw from first year medical students at UI
COM, as well as other medical schools in the Chicago metropolitan area and Midwest. We have assembled an
outstanding team of mentors in NIDDK mission areas with expertise in basic/mechanistic, clinical/translational,
and behavioral/community-based research. In addition to mentored research, students will participate in an
interactive structured curriculum focused on research methodology, responsible conduct of research, and
career development. To learn presentation skills and principles of rigor and reproducibility, students will co-
lead, with a research mentor, journal clubs and works-in-progress sessions. Additional novel aspects of the
program include use of peer-to-peer mentoring and ongoing exposure to successful early career physician-
scientists. At the end of the summer, students will present at a SRTP Research Symposium and the COM
Research Day. After the program is completed, the program will utilize multiple strategies to facilitate continued
involvement in research activities, including encouraging students to apply to the James Scholar Program, a
program that provides the infrastructure to support research during the second to fourth years of medical
school. In addition, the program will strive to create a sense of community among SRTP cohorts by hosting
quarterly “Ideas on Tap” (research/social networking events at which students present ongoing research), and
will maintain connections with trainees using the program website, newsletters, an SRTP Slack communication
channel, and social media. An Executive Committee will oversee implementation of the program,
recruitment/selection, program evaluation, and tracking of short- and long-term outcomes. Strengths of the
program include the experienced co-Directors, committed and well-funded program mentors with broad
expertise across NIDDK mission areas, an innovative structured curriculum, a robust recruitment plan to
enhance diversity, strong institutional support, and a thoughtfully conceived plan to foster continued research
involvement after program completion. Consequently, the proposed SRTP will provide medical students with a
substantive research experience, facilitating the achievement of the long-term objective of increasing the
pipeline and diversity of physicians entering the research workforce in NIDDK mission areas."
10911931,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer has proven to be remarkably effective, but most patients who
are treated with immunotherapy do not respond. Our understanding of what determines the response to
immunotherapy remains poor. Immune recognition and destruction of cancer cells occurs at the level of the
tumor microenvironment (TME), but the human TME has been difficult to study due to a lack of suitable
preclinical models, the challenges in acquiring adequate patient tumor tissues, and a lack of analytic tools to
study the complex interplay between cancer and the immune system. In this proposal, we will directly
investigate the changes immunotherapy produces in the TME of patients over time by utilizing samples from a
serial multi-site tumor biopsy approach in two trials of in situ vaccination (ISV) in follicular lymphoma. we are
leveraging technological advances in single cell genomics and multiparameter histology platforms to study
limited samples in great depth as well as bioinformatics advances that allow us to extract important information
from large complex datasets with a goal of identifying the key tumor-immune interactions before treatment and
the evolution of immune responses with treatment. We will focus on how T-cell phenotypes and clonotypes
change after ISV and relate to tumor responses (Aim 1), on whether tumor cell responses to ISV may enhance
the generation of anti-tumor immunity (Aim 2), and on interactions between cells in the TME (Aim 3). This
comprehensive approach will yield critical insights into the determinants of successful immunotherapy.
This work will be undertaken by Tanaya Shree, MD PhD, a fellow in the Department of Oncology at the
Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Shree completed a dual MD/PhD program at Cornell/ Rockefeller
University/ Sloan-Kettering where she discovered that tumor-associated macrophages helped murine breast
cancer survive chemotherapy and that dampening critical macrophage functions could improve chemotherapy
efficacy. At Stanford, Dr. Shree continues to investigate cancer and the immune system, having developed two
investigator-initiated immunotherapy trials, studied the immune health of lymphoma survivors, and established
expertise in immunology and high-dimensional assays for studying mechanisms of immunotherapy.
Dr. Shree will be mentored in this work by Ronald Levy, MD, and Hanlee Ji, MD. Both are physician-scientists
who have made significant contributions to the fields of cancer immunotherapy and genomics and have
mentored numerous successful independent researchers. In addition, a distinguished committee of advisors,
consisting of Drs. Crystal Mackall, Garry Nolan, and Ash Alizadeh, will guide her research and career
development. Dr. Shree’s training plan focuses on didactic and practical training in advanced immunology,
bioinformatics, and biostatistics to complement her substantial skills and experience in biomedical research."
10911938,"Short tandem repeat regions (STR) are distributed evenly across the human genome, and recent genome-wide
studies have demonstrated that STRs are polymorphic across individuals and linked to gene expression levels.
STR instability at key genomic loci has been causally linked to disease pathophysiology in a range of expansion
disorders. We recently demonstrated that nearly all disease-associated STRs co-localize with boundaries
demarcating topologically associated domains (TADs). Moreover, we have observed that pathologic STR
instability and transcriptional silencing can destroy the associated boundary and shift genomic loci to the nuclear
periphery. These results now open critical unanswered questions regarding whether and how STR expansion
and pathologic alterations in gene expression are functionally linked to boundary integrity and radial positioning.
Here, we focus on the prototypic repeat expansion disorder Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) in which expansion of a
GAA STR in the first intron of the FRATAXIN (FXN) gene results in cardiac and neuronal pathology. The cardiac
pathology, specifically hypertrophy, fibrosis, and occasional dilation of the ventricle, is the etiology of significant
FRDA mortality. GAA expansion is associated with the silencing of FXN transcription and a repositioning of the
locus to the nuclear periphery. However, it remains unclear if the change in genome folding, radial positioning,
or reduced expression drives STR expansion or vice versa. A major technical barrier contributing to this
knowledge gap is that STR instability and genome folding are classically evaluated in bulk populations, however
they exhibit tremendous variation across individual somatic cells of the same subtype and among cell types
within a pathologically affected tissue. Here, we seek to decipher the causal link among STR instability,
transcription, radial positioning, and genome folding. Our central hypothesis is that disruption of long-range loops
is the initial event triggered by STR expansion leading to a cascade of heterochromatin spreading, silencing, and
loss of radial positioning. We will test our hypothesis by generating genome-wide, single-cell maps of chromatin
accessibility, expression, and the repressive H3K9me3 heterochromatin mark in GAA-expanded and control iPS
cells and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. We will integrate genomics data with single-cell sequential
Oligopaints/OligoSTORM imaging of TADs and local chromatin structure, as well as single molecule RNA FISH
for FXN expression. We will implement multiple genome engineering strategies, including dCas9-VP64 FXN
activation and dCas9-CTCF loop re-engineering in FRDA GAA-iPS cells, and dCas9-Krab-Dnmt3a FXN
silencing and dCas9-Krab CTCF-mediated loop disruption in healthy iPS cells. We will assay the effect of
genome engineering approaches on TADs, radial positioning, STR length, and FXN expression in single cells.
Successful completion of the proposed work will shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
repeat expansion disorders by deciphering the cause-and-effect relationships among genome folding, radial
positioning, transcription, and STR expansion."
10911941,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on those who are incarcerated and work in our
nation's prisons and jails. The prison population has had an infection rate that is five times the rate in the
general population and correctional staff have been infected at three times the rate of the general population.
High rates of COVID-19 in correctional systems are linked to high rates in surrounding communities, especially
in jails with high population turnover and in communities where correctional officers work. Vaccination in
correctional systems is an important community-wide COVID-19 mitigation strategy. But rates of vaccine
acceptance vary considerably, in part due to issues of distrust and unique social norms and policies within
correctional systems. Prior work on vaccine acceptance strategies, even amongst Black and Latinx people who
are disproportionately incarcerated, has rarely focused on strategies that work in corrections. Until this
knowledge gap is addressed, it will be difficult to reduce the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on
minoritized populations in correctional facilities and the communities to which they return. This is especially
important with ongoing new variants emerging. The overall objective of this proposal, ADdressing Vaccine
AcceptaNce in Carceral Settings through Community Engagement (ADVANCE), is to identify feasible and
effective interventions to improve vaccine uptake in prisons. We will adapt the successful P3 vaccine
acceptance model for healthcare practices, developed by our team, to identify new and iterate on old strategies
appropriate for prisons, creating a new Patient, Provider, Practice, Prison-level (P4) framework. The central
hypothesis of the proposal is that strategies developed by and studied in partnership with people directly
impacted by the correctional system will increase vaccine acceptance. To test this hypothesis, we will tackle
three aims: (1) identify promising correctional system-based strategies to improve vaccine acceptance; (2)
adapt these strategies into an updated P4 framework using community based participatory research approach;
and (3) study the effectiveness of these interventions through rapid cycle, cluster-randomized trials in the
Pennsylvania correctional system. Throughout study phases, currently and previously incarcerated people and
correctional staff will provide input so P4 interventions are most likely to succeed. ADVANCE represents a
substantial departure from previous work on vaccine acceptance by focusing on providing an evidence base
for addressing vaccine acceptance in correctional systems that can be scaled and adapted for other justice-
involved populations."
10910474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Historically largely focused on the demise of neurons, a wealth of literature in the neurodegeneration field has
provided strong evidence for a critical role of neuroinflammation. It is now well established that both astro- and
microgliosis contribute to disease onset and/or progression. These glial cells can directly respond to the
aggregate/condensate pathology that characterizes these conditions and this has been suggested to underlie
their hyperinflammation. Yet, why this happens has been puzzling as humans never experienced selective
pressure to evolve the ability to detect age-related pathology. Why do glia respond to something they have never
been trained to respond to? The immune system did evolve detection systems for infection, and the evolutionary
arms race between humans and their pathogens has shaped a plethora of receptors and signaling cascades
that are involved in the sensing of and immediate response to infection. This is the innate immune system.
 Recently, I unexpectedly discovered that some of these neuropathological proteins mimic the biophysical
behavior of innate immune signals. Antimicrobial peptides—mostly known for their killer activity towards
pathogens—also moonlight as pro-inflammatory signals. More specifically, these cationic peptides can promote
the immunogenicity of nucleic acids towards their Toll-like receptors, in a process that is dependent on the
electrostatic condensation of such peptides with the anionic nucleic acids. Condensing these immunogens
concentrates them, protects them from degradation, and drives their trafficking to their corresponding receptor—
hereby dramatically boosting the inflammatory response. Neuropathological proteins from many diseases
condense or aggregate with nucleic acids, suggesting that such potent immune triggers are commonly found in
the diseased brain. We show that the pathology associated with the most common genetic form of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia indeed signals to the innate immune system via this condensation-
dependent mechanism. Thus, I propose the provocative idea that neuropathology in general must hijack such
ancient immune signaling cascades to trigger the immune system. This hypothesis provides and elegant
explanation of the decades-old question of the molecular origins of neuroinflammation.
 In this proposal, my lab will set out to rigorously test this hypothesis using a multidisciplinary approach
that spans from biophysics to in vivo disease modeling. By leveraging our expertise in condensate biology,
building on preliminary data from our genetics- and proteomics-based approaches, and using in vitro and in vivo
models, we will uncover the biophysical rules and signaling cascades underlying this molecular mimicry.
Neuroinflammation is a key modifier of disease progression. If successful, we will identify promising new
candidates and compounds for therapeutic neuro-immunomodulation in these devastating diseases."

In many mammalian species, infants rely on parental caregiving to survive the vulnerable phase of early
development. Considerable evidence indicates that infants are not just passive recipients of parental care and
maternal separation for even a few hours a day during early postnatal life can lead to profound social deficits in
adult mice. Indeed, it is well established that early life adversity leads to long-lasting sociability deficits in
humans, and developmental sensory processing deficits are closely associated with neurodevelopmental
disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Moreover, ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders are
marked by sex bias in their manifestation, but the sources of this sexual dimorphism is not understood.
Although recent work has revealed mechanistic insights into adult circuit dysfunction induced by early-life
adversity, we know close to nothing about how the infant nervous system encodes parental cues.
Investigations of infant neural processing have been held back by a lack of behavioral paradigms and
technologies to capture and manipulate neural activity and gene expression during the first few days of life. In
preliminary experiments, we have developed a monomolecular odorant induced olfactory imprinting paradigm
which induces a long-lasting appetitive memory of maternal odors experienced during the first few days after
birth. These results provide an opportunity to dissect neural mechanisms underlying valence attachment to
maternal cues and its contributions to the development of social behaviors. Here, we propose to develop a
modular genetic and viral toolkit for the rapid and reversible interrogation of neural activity and gene
expression, allowing us to directly investigate the infant nervous system. We will use these tools to achieve the
following goals: First, we will genetically identify sensory neurons that attach positive valence to neutral
olfactory cues underlying olfactory imprinting. Next, we will use spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively map
neuronal cell-types in the sensory periphery and forebrain of mouse pups and explore the origins of sexual
dimorphisms in early-life social processing. In summary, by combining high resolution behavioral, molecular
and genetic tools, our project will provide the first characterization of ethologically relevant sensory processing
mechanisms in the infant brain and provide insights into the role of maternal cues in the ontogeny of social
behavior."

its postdoctoral fellows so that they become successful, independent leaders in cancer research. The program
will accomplish this goal by providing each trainee with a mentored research experience in cancer prevention
or control. The program’s 24 participating faculty are funded PIs of grants totaling $53 million in direct costs
annually, an average of $2.2 million per PI. The group includes 19 PhDs and 5 MDs from 7 departments at
Northwestern. All mentors are leading experts in the areas of cancer risk behaviors and screening,
measurement and intervention science, patient reported outcomes, or community engagement. By teaching
trainees to apply cutting edge measurement and intervention science strategies to the behavioral and
psychosocial aspects of cancer prevention and control, we will train a next generation of researchers to reduce
cancer risk, address disparities, and improve the lives of community members affected by cancer in a more
efficient and more cost-effective fashion. Research experiences will be complemented by a weekly seminar,
professional development activities, and the opportunity to enroll in either the MPH, MSCI, MSEB, or HSOR
master’s programs. The Program creates an individual development plan (IDP) for each trainee and provides
regular oversight by a primary mentor and co-mentor to meet training goals.
 Trainees also have access to a vast array of educational resources made available by the University for
all postdoctoral trainees, including biweekly sessions dedicated to career development, “survival” skills, and
learning to succeed and flourish. The program enrolls three new postdoctoral fellows in each of years 1-4, with
balanced representation of fellows in cancer prevention and cancer control. We expect to continue to have a
large pool of potential trainees of whom a majority have a research background (PhD in a behavioral or social
science, exercise science, or nutrition) and a minority have a clinical background (MD intending to pursue a
physician/scientist career). External and Internal Advisory Committees will continue to oversee all aspects of
the Program. Ongoing evaluation and feedback from the Advisory Committees will ensure that changes are
implemented as needed and that training goals are consistently met. The program meets a pressing need to
train a next generation of career investigators who can develop, optimize, and evaluate behavioral and
psychosocial assessments and interventions to prevent and control cancer and improve quality of life."

Developing new approaches for obtaining accurate estimates of dietary intake is crucial for revealing true
associations between dietary intakes and disease risk, with the ultimate aim of establishing evidence-based
guidelines. While the evidence on dietary sugars and increased risks of dental caries and obesity have been
stronger, the association between sugars and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes
(T2D), and cancer remains inconclusive. The findings on total and animal protein (AP) intake in relation to T2D
risk and CVD or all-cause mortality have also been inconsistent. Dietary biomarkers alleviate the problem of
measurement errors (ME) associated with self-reporting dietary instruments commonly used in nutritional
epidemiology, and have been used to validate and calibrate self-reported diet or to adjust for ME in self-
reports, and reveal important associations. In the parent project of this renewal application, (SugarsBio study,
U01-CA197902), we confirmed 24-h urinary sucrose and fructose (24uSF) as a predictive biomarker of total
sugars (TS) intake, and demonstrated the transportability of the biomarker equation for estimating biomarker-
based TS intake and its use across different populations. Furthermore, we have identified serum carbon
isotope ratio (CIR) as a candidate predictive biomarker of the AP to total protein intake ratio (APR), a novel
biomarker of protein quality, and developed a biomarker equation that can be used to generate biomarker-
based APR in studies with available biological samples. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the utility
and application of 24uSF and serum CIR biomarkers in diverse populations in two prospective cohorts.
For this purpose, we will leverage data from two large dietary validation studies with comprehensive validation
protocols (IDATA and SOLNAS) nested within cohorts, the NIH-AARP Diet and Health (AARP) Study and the
Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). First, we will study the ME in self-reported
TS, and APR, AP and plant protein (PP) intake, using 24uSF and serum CIR biomarkers. Second, we will
develop regression calibration equations for self-reported intake, based on biomarkers, in IDATA and SOLNAS
that we will apply in their respective cohorts. Third, we will investigate uncalibrated and calibrated (i.e., ME-
corrected) self-reported intakes of TS, AP, PP and APR in relation to CVD mortality in the AARP, and T2D risk
in the HCHS/SOL cohort. Our study will be the first study that applies the newly developed US population-
based sugars and protein intake biomarkers and their calibration equations to race/ethnically diverse US
population-based studies and evaluates ME-corrected dietary intakes in relation to chronic diseases. By
informing the best practices for applying these biomarkers in future diet validation studies and studies of
diet-disease associations, this proposal will significantly contribute to improving dietary assessments and
enhancing scientific rigor of nutritional epidemiologic studies."

 In early 2020, a new virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), generated headlines due to
its unprecedented rate of transmission. SARS-CoV-2 caused the first reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in December 2019 and continues to spread worldwide. As a family of RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to mutate at a rate
up to a million times faster than its hosts1,2. These rapid genomic alterations have already generated highly transmissible
variants, and have raised concerns that the virus will evade vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, a large percentage of
the global population remains unvaccinated, due to the challenges of production and mass distribution, vaccine hesitancy,
and pending approval status for patients under age 12. Therefore, an effective antiviral has the potential to relieve suffering
for millions—not only helping individual patients recover and reducing the number of deaths, but also limiting the number
of positive carriers and thereby curbing the spread of the pandemic.
 This proposal aims to develop an efficient antiviral to impede the virus’ entry into cells, specifically into lung alveolar type
II (AT2) cells, the stem cells of the distal lung. Thanks to recent studies, we know which “door” (a receptor called ACE2) and
“key” (a protease called TMPRSS2) the virus uses to enter cells. Our goal is to remove the key so the virus cannot open the
door and enter host cells. We will use a conventional air-liquid interface (ALI) culture that is representative of the in vivo
airway and a recently developed 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro lung organoid model that recapitulates many aspects of lung
structure and the cellular environment and that has been used to study respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These
systems represent tissues better than cell lines, but offers the benefit of being less complex than tissue explants or animal
models. In addition, we have generated a panel of highly sensitive and specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
directed against TMPRSS2. In preliminary studies, the lead TMPRSS2 mAb, AL20, shows no signs of cytotoxicity with a trend
towards inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in cell lines and in lung organoids. Furthermore, we have identified at
least two serine protease inhibitors (serpins) that form complexes with TMPRSS2, and the presence of these complexes is
inversely correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. These findings lead to our hypothesis that targeting TMPRSS2 can
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and spread.
 To test our hypothesis, we will first test the efficacy of AL20 for blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into AT2 cells in lung
organoids and in airway epithelial cells in ALI cultures, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We will then evaluate the
effects of serpins on TMPRSS2 activity and SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and spread. Finally, to explore the feasibility of advancing
AL20 to human trials, we will test humanized AL20 in a SARS-CoV-2 hamster model. Syrian golden hamsters are naturally
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection that recapitulates the clinical, virological, histopathological, and immunological
characteristics of human disease, enabling study of its pathogenesis, transmission, and passive immunization effect.
Transgenic human ACE2 is not required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, ensuring that the cell types infected are highly relevant.
 These studies will provide critical insights into the mechanisms whereby TMPRSS2 regulates SARS-CoV-2 entry, and suggest
potential therapeutic candidates against COVID-19. The proposed work has the potential to impact the lives of millions of
individuals affected by COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A, that use TMPRSS2 to enter cells."

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), who use hemodialysis as their kidney replacement method,
require vascular access in the form of an arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheter to
receive life-sustaining hemodialysis. Providers and patients face selection of a vascular access type without
adequate evidence of likely outcomes. To overcome this key barrier, the goal of this R01 proposal is to optimize
the patient experience of vascular access decision-making by a) developing an interactive, evidence-based
guide to vascular access outcomes that incorporates a prognostic model for short and long-term outcomes of
vascular access and b) identifying best practices for utilization of the guide during the clinician-patient encounter.
To do so, a novel, large-scale data source that contains multi-institutional granular data regarding vascular
access operations and their short and long-term outcomes will be created by linking the Vascular Quality Initiative
Vascular Access Registry (VQIVAR) to the United States Renal Data Systems Registry (USRDS) and Medicare
claims. Prognostic models will be developed, by using traditional statistical approaches (e.g., logistic regression,
Kaplan-Meier estimates) and machine learning methods (e.g., Bayesian networks, random forests) to predict
outcomes that are meaningful to patients (revision procedures, repeat vascular access operation), and compare
these models using technical metrics (e.g., sensitivity/specificity). The best-performing models will be selected
and tested for external validity in a local UCLA population.
Simultaneously, a mixed-methods approach will be used to engage patient and provider stakeholders to
collaborate in creation and implementation of the proposed guide to vascular access outcomes, assessing the:
1) preferred means of communication with the clinician during the vascular access decision-making encounter;
2) optimal methods for incorporating the guide (including the prognostic model) into the decision-making process;
and 3) satisfaction with iterative versions of the guide. The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1 Design, evaluate and test the externally validity of the prognostic models for hemodialysis vascular
access outcomes, to be used in vascular access decision-making, generated from VQIVAR data linked to
USRDS and Medicare claims using statistical and machine learning methods and validated in a UCLA cohort
with model calibration.
Aim 2 Identify best practices for the clinician-patient vascular access decision-making interaction by
using a mixed methods approach that includes individual interviews, direct observation, and quantitative
satisfaction and preference scales.
Aim 3 Create and refine an interactive guide to vascular access outcomes based on the best-performing
prognostic model created in Aim 1, that allows for personalization with each patient’s characteristics, by engaging
patient and provider stakeholders in an iterative fashion to incorporate their feedback and arrive at a final guide."
10911593,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteriophages (phages) are bacteria-specific viruses. Phages play a major role in the life cycle and evolution
of Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria that causes cholera. Despite the presence of many V. cholerae-specific phage
types in the environment, only three types, ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3, are commonly found at high concentrations
in the watery diarrhea shed by cholera patients. Thus, these three phages are special for their ability to survive
in the human intestinal tract, where they replicate on and kill V. cholerae. Of these phages, ICP3 is the most
virulent in terms of its ability to kill V. cholerae. The emergence of resistance to ICP1, ICP2 and to other phages
is frequent in V. cholerae, but, for unknown reasons, resistance to ICP3 is exceedingly rare. This makes ICP3
of great interest for use as a product to treat or prevent cholera. The use of phages for therapy or prevention of
bacterial infections is gaining broad interest due to the emergence of multidrug resistance in many bacterial
pathogens, including V. cholerae. To gain a better understanding of ICP3’s virulence and lack of emergence of
host resistance, in this exploratory project we will delete each of the approximately four dozen accessory genes
of ICP3 and test their roles in circumventing the phage defense systems of V. cholerae. Addionally, we will
identify the cognate host phage defense genes in V. cholerae for each ICP3 accessory gene. The results will
shed much light on ICP3's special abilities, and will encourage the development of ICP3 into a product for use
in combatting cholera."
10913525,"Abstract
This proposal investigates the cornea-trigeminal neural circuit with particular emphasis on the
relationship between the cornea epithelium and the intraepithelial nerves to investigate the
hypothesis that ocular surface pathologies that involve transient and/or prolonged corneal
epithelial barrier disruption will cause greater nociceptor stimulation, discomfort, pain and a
compensatory reduction in epithelial and stromal nerve density. Single cell RNA and epigenetic
profiling and in situ hybridization will be performed in corneal and trigeminal ganglion cells that
project to the cornea in homeostatic conditions and after epithelial barrier disruption due to dry
eye and corneal epithelial debridement. Data from these assays will be integrated and single cell
atlases of the cornea and trigeminal ganglion under normal and stressed conditions will generated
that identify cells based on unique expression profiles. Cells will be spatially resolved in these
tissues to identify communications between corneal cells and nerve axons and between trigeminal
neuronal and non-neuronal cells. In the ganglion, temporally and spatially resolved transcriptomic
data will be associated with the changes in corneal epithelial nerve morphology and sensitivity
that occur after barrier disruption to identify genes that maintain the corneal epithelial nerves in
health and promote the pathological changes after barrier disruption. Three specific aims are
proposed to investigate the cornea-trigeminal circuit. Aim 1 will investigate the effects of barrier
disruption from dry eye and epithelial debridement on transcriptomic profiles, corneal epithelial
nerve morphology and nerve function. Aim 2 will investigate the effects of preserving epithelial
barrier in the MMP-9 knockout strain in dry eye and epithelial wounding on these parameters, and
Aim 3 will investigate the effects of two neural sensitizing chemokines on the circuit in normal and
dry eyes.
The proposed experiments investigate the cornea epithelial-trigeminal sensory circuit at a
coordinated deep level to identify factors that impact the intraepithelial nerves in health and
disease. At the conclusion of this project, we will have a better understanding of the mechanisms
by which corneal epithelial cells and intact barrier suppress nerve activation and the factors
produced by cornea cells in barrier disrupted corneas that cause nerve degeneration and
heightened sensitivity. The benchmark accomplishments of this project will be a fundamental
new understanding of the impact of corneal epithelial barrier disruption that occurs in common
corneal diseases on the integrity and function of the corneal epithelial nerve network."
10913298,"Background/Significance: The 2018 MISSION Act allows Veterans to seek healthcare from non-VHA
providers through the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP). However, shortages of mental health
providers in over 50% of U.S. rural counties jeopardize access to psychological services in these areas. These
shortages indicate a growing need to bridge gaps in the provision of mental healthcare in rural communities.
The VCCP presents a distinct opportunity for VHA to leverage its relationships with community stakeholders to
develop innovative strategies to improve access to high-quality care for rural Veterans. Guided by the VHA
state-of-the-art access model, this project seeks to understand the current state of VCCP mental healthcare
and build a program that uses community engagement strategies to support community providers in delivering
high-quality care to rural Veterans. This work will initially focus on rural Veterans who have experienced
military sexual trauma (MST). These Veterans represent a high priority, understudied rural Veteran population.
MST exposure is common among Veterans (25-33% of females, 1-3% of males) and associated with high
rates of psychiatric distress and suicide risk. Preliminary data show that, despite equivalent rates of MST
exposure, rural Veterans are less likely to receive psychotherapy than urban Veterans. Research on specific
access barriers and gaps in mental healthcare for rural Veterans with MST is greatly needed.
Innovation: Project innovations include: (1) targeting a high priority rural Veteran population with a history of
MST, (2) obtaining input from Veterans and frontline community providers, and (3) novel use of community
engagement and planning (CEP) to address gaps in rural mental healthcare. CEP is a community-based
participatory research strategy designed to increase the capacity of community providers in delivering
evidence-based care and building a community network of services.
Specific Aims/Methods: Guided by the VHA access model, Aim 1 will use qualitative interviews and
secondary data analysis to examine VCCP mental healthcare for MST. Qualitative interviews with Veterans will
explore perceived accessibility, quality, and satisfaction with this care. A secondary analysis of VHA
administrative and community care data will assess VCCP delivery and access outcomes (e.g., appointment
wait time, session length and duration). Aim 1 data will support an HSR&D IIR proposal by year 3 to conduct
an in-depth evaluation of VCCP delivery of MST-related mental healthcare. These data will also inform
development of the Enhancing Community Care for MST Program in Aims 2 and 3. The proposed program
aims to support VCCP and other community providers in aligning VHA and community resources to increase
delivery of MST-related mental healthcare to rural Veterans. The program will educate community providers
about evidence-based MST-related clinical practices and provide group consultation to facilitate their use of
these practices. Group consultation will also include structured activities to assist providers in developing a
collaborative community network of MST-related services. Aim 3 will pilot the feasibility and acceptability of the
proposed program. Depending on Aim 3 findings, the PI will submit either an HSR&D pilot to refine the
program or a larger research project (e.g., HSR&D IIR, VHA Office of Rural Health demonstration project).
Next Steps: To achieve research aims and facilitate the PI’s transition to an independent VHA health services
researcher, the CDA will provide advanced training in qualitative data analysis, community-engaged research
methods, and program development and evaluation. These training goals will be accomplished through formal
coursework, mentorship, and participation in training workshops, seminars, and conferences. The expertise
gained from training and research activities will allow the PI to execute a line of research that aligns with VHA’s
priorities of access to care/rural access and MISSION Act."
10913445,"Basement membranes are the oldest, most conserved forms of extracellular matrix and serve to separate tissue
layers, direct signals to neighboring cells, insulate tissues from signals, and provide mechanical support. Further,
basement membranes are subject to mechanical damage and require repair. Faulty basement membrane repair
can aid in the progression of diseases such as asthma and diabetes, and diseases of the basement membrane
itself, including Alport syndrome and Goodpasture syndrome. Therefore, understanding how basement
membranes repair will be vital to treating these conditions. My work utilizes the Drosophila midgut basement
membrane to probe repair dynamics. In Drosophila, all major basement membrane components have been
conserved but with less redundancy than mammals. Our lab has developed an assay to reproducibly damage
the basement membrane and study the repair process. Following damage, the basement membrane becomes
less stiff and less dense, indicated by a mechanical stress/strain assay and electron microscopy, respectively.
Previously it was reported that processes required for basement membrane repair are also required to maintain
basement membranes that have not been damaged; these processes include continuous matrix synthesis and
regulation of enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases and peroxidasin). Thus, it is unclear whether basement
membrane damage is actively detected, or instead, passively repaired by homeostatic mechanisms. My
preliminary data suggest basement membrane damage is actively detected. Following damage, the synthesis of
matrix components is upregulated in a specific subset of gut epithelial cells we call matrix-makers, and these
may be the same cells that express a mechanosensory stretch-activated ion channel, Piezo. This raises the
possibility that a change in stiffness of damaged basement membranes signals the initiation of repair. Piezo
knockout flies are able to assemble and maintain basement membranes in the adult fly, but, excitingly, Piezo
knockouts cannot repair basement membranes after damage. This is evidence of a unique mechanism that
detects basement membrane damage and initiates repair. I hypothesize that a loss in matrix stiffness triggers
basement membrane repair mechanisms. In Aim 1, I propose to characterize a transient cell population
responsible for synthesizing new matrix components following basement membrane damage. In Aim 2, I
propose to identify the role of Piezo and its response following basement membrane damage. I expect to identify
the first mechanism for detecting and repairing basement membranes. Understanding this mechanism will
provide fundamental insights into epithelial biology and will be critical to treating and understanding diseases of
the basement membrane."

Somatic mutations occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout life. By chance, a mutation may disrupt
a key gene and confer a competitive advantage on the mutant HSC, leading to expansion of its clonal progeny.
This phenomenon is called clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and is ubiquitous with increasing age. CH is associated
with elevated risk for hematological malignancy, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, type II diabetes, and
overall all-cause mortality. Nearly all adults older than 50 years harbor CH clones with mutations in leukemia-
associated genes, but these mutant clones comprise a very low fraction of total blood cells and thus are
speculated to be functionally inert. A growing body of literature indicates that, in most individuals, low-frequency
mutant clonal blood fractions remain stable over time. However, no models exist that capture the behavior of
these stochastically arising low-frequency clones. Thus, whether driver mutation acquisition and adequate time
will lead to eventual clonal expansion remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to determine the extent to
which underlying HSC mutation burden and acquisition of CH drivers are sufficient for clonal expansion over
time. Preliminary calculations predict every coding gene is mutated about 70 times in the HSC pool during an
average human lifespan, indicating mutation in a CH driver gene is inevitable with longevity. In contrast, native
CH has never been reported in murine models, possibly because mice have fewer HSCs and a limited lifespan
during which to acquire HSC mutations. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that clonal hematopoiesis
emergence is the product of sufficient mutation rate and time. I will evaluate this hypothesis using two murine
models for stochastic mutation acquisition. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will query aged wild-type mice to
determine the extent that advanced age, independent of lifespan, promotes the development of CH. In Aim 2, I
will experimentally elevate the global mutation burden in murine HSCs to determine if the stochastic acquisition
of a CH driver mutation will lead to mutant clonal expansion over time, and how an aged milieu impacts CH
development. The experiments will define the sufficiency of mutation burden and time for promoting clonal
hematopoiesis and will determine the role of an aged microenvironment in clonal expansion. Overall, this work
may uncover strategies to enhance healthy aging via modulation of mutant clonal outgrowth."

Neonates have the highest infection-related mortality of any age group with viral pneumonia
causing the majority of these estimated 1 million deaths per year. A majority of neonates in the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) receive empiric antibiotic therapy. This antibiotic exposure
dysregulates the development of immunity, including influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, although
exactly how early-life antibiotic exposure affects the formation and function of tissue-resident
CD8+ T cells is unclear. With their canonical role as adaptive responders to viral infection, CD8+
T cells are key effector immune cells in both immediate and long-term host defense against
serious viral pneumonia. It is essential to better define how exactly early-life antibiotic exposure
disrupts tissue-resident CD8+ T cell formation and function in order to lessen the substantial
pneumonia-related mortality in neonates. Preliminary flow cytometry data in this proposal shows
that early-life antibiotic exposure reduces the formation of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, which
leads to higher viral burden and morbidity. Preliminary single cell RNA (scRNA-) and single cell
Assay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATACseq) data shows a similar
reduction in lung CD8+ T cells that is controlled by specific alterations in gene regulatory networks.
This data drives the overall hypothesis of this proposal that early-life antibiotic exposure
leads to a decrease in the formation and functions of tissue-resident CD8+ T cells following
both primary and heterotypic Influenza A infection. This proposal will test this hypothesis by
determining the effect of early-life antibiotic exposure on the formation and function of CD8+ T
cells in the lungs following challenge with Influenza A (Aim 1) and determining regulatory
mechanisms governing how this early-life antibiotic exposure affects the functions of CD8+ T cells
(Aim 2). Collectively, this work will provide novel, mechanistic insights into how early-life antibiotic
exposure is affecting the functions of influenza-specific tissue-resident CD8+ T cells. These Aims
expect to show an antibiotic-mediated reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production,
and proliferation, as well as changes in specific gene regulatory networks underlying the
functional dysregulation. The candidate driving this proposal is currently an MD/PhD student at
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in the laboratory of Dr. Hitesh Deshmukh, who will use this proposal
to set a foundation for an independent career as a physician-scientist. The candidate will use this
proposal to support his future in the clinic as a pediatric intensivist, where findings from this
proposal will uncover new strategies leading to better outcomes for the most vulnerable neonates."
10913337,"ABSTRACT
Phosphorylation is one of the most ubiquitous, reversible posttranslational modifications in cells. The enzymes
responsible for controlling the phosphorylation state of the cell are kinases, which catalyze the transfer of the
γ-phosphate moiety of ATP to substrates, and phosphatases, which catalyze the reverse hydrolysis reaction,
the removal of the phosphate moiety from phosphorylated substrates. Thus, phosphatases dynamically reverse
the effects of kinases. Because phosphorylation is critical for all biological processes from cell growth to
differentiation to development, the location and duration of the reciprocal actions of kinases and phosphatases
must be exquisitely regulated both temporally and spatially within the cell. Consequently, when this tight
regulation is disrupted, dysregulation of phosphorylation signaling ensues and the consequence is most often
disease. Deletion of either one of two PP1 regulators—SDS22 (PPP1R7) or Inhibitor-3 (I3; PPP1R11 or Ypi1
in yeast)—is lethal in yeast (essential genes), highlighting their biological significance. However, since their
discovery, different biological roles have been assigned to SDS22 and I3, including roles in mitosis (SDS22),
E3 ligase functionality (I3), PP1 biogenesis, among others. Thus, while it is clear that SDS22 and I3 are
essential PP1 regulators, their true biological function(s) and especially their mechanism(s) of action are still
unknown. This has hindered progress in understanding their roles in PP1 biology. In cells, these proteins form
both heterodimeric (SDS22:PP1 and I3:PP1) and a heterotrimeric (SDS22:I3:PP1; SIP) PP1 complex. The
structure and function(s) of the individual dimeric complexes, if and how the structure and function(s) of the
trimeric complex differs from those of the dimeric complexes and the role(s) of each complex in PP1
holoenzyme formation are major questions in the field. Further, additional data suggest that dissociation of the
SIP complex requires the AAA+ ATPase p37/p97. However, the molecular details of SIP complex dissociation
have also remained elusive. The presented research project uses a powerful integrated approach that
combines structural biology with biochemical and cell biology experiments to obtain novel insights into the
molecular mechanisms used by these regulators to control PP1 activity and direct PP1 holoenzyme assembly.
Because PP1 holoenzymes have critical roles in human diseases, the proposed work will provide novel
strategies for selectively inhibiting PP1 activity by targeting the PP1 holoenzyme formation and subunit
exchange, which is essential for understanding how distinct PPPs contribute to disease."

The goal of the proposed NIAAA K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to
support Dr. Brittany Bryant in gaining the knowledge, skills, and expertise required for the successful transition
from clinical practice to building a career as an independent clinical researcher focused on improving treatment
options for Black justice-involved youth (JIY). Black JIY are overrepresented in the criminal justice system due
to institutional racism and discrimination. The General Strain Theory posits that high levels of ethnic and racial
discrimination (ERD), paired with elevated levels of witnessing or experiencing police brutality, places Black JIY
at unique risk of increased alcohol and other drug use (AOD) as a means of coping with stressful events. Black
JIY report engaging in comorbid alcohol and cannabis use to achieve temporary respite from discrimination-
induced stress. While JIY engage in higher rates of comorbid alcohol and cannabis use compared to non-justice-
involved youth, overall, Black JIY are less likely to be diverted to substance use treatment programs, less likely
to engage in care after being released on probation, less likely to benefit from substance use treatment in terms
of reduced risk of recidivism, and are more adversely affected by early onset of AOD activity than White JIY. To
date, no known adolescent substance use treatment directly addresses ERD, the increased risk of AOD due to
ERD, or explicitly presents tools on how to appropriately respond to AOD and discrimination distress among
Black JIY. To address this problem, Dr. Bryant’s research program aspires to improve the understanding of 1)
the impact of ERD on adolescent AOD within the Black JIY population; 2) culturally adapt the evidence-based
Cannabis Youth Treatment Series (CYT) using the ADAPT-ITT model to address ERD, reduce AOD, and reduce
recidivism with input from Black JIY, parents, and community members; and 3) pilot the culturally adapted
intervention to assess feasibility, acceptability, and changes in substance use and discrimination distress. For
the duration of the award, Dr. Bryant will 1) increase her record of scholarly publications; 2) expand knowledge
and skills in mixed methods research and applied research methods; 3) develop expertise in effectively
conducting community-based research; and 4) obtain training in effectively culturally adapting evidence based
interventions. The training and mentorship afforded to Dr. Bryant will enhance her career development and long-
term goals of becoming an independent community-based clinical researcher focused on improving treatment
options, policies, and procedures to decriminalize substance use and prioritize diverting Black JIY to substance
use treatment. Moreover, the proposed project aligns with NIAAA’s strategic plan to 1) prioritize the development
of culturally appropriate interventions to prevent or reduce alcohol misuse and related consequences, 2) improve
the implementation, accessibility, and use of alcohol treatment tailored to the needs of individuals, and 3) raise
awareness about the effects of alcohol on health and well-being, while supporting an underrepresented woman
of color trained in AOD research."

Dysphagia (swallowing impairment) is a serious health condition seen in many age-related disease and injury
processes. Although videofluoroscopy (VF) is an international “gold standard” dysphagia diagnostic exam,
there is a paucity of available normative physiologic VF reference values in healthy adults across the age span
to guide interpretation of this examination. This fundamental gap in knowledge contributes to poor agreement
in the identification of swallowing impairment and its underlying mechanisms. To enable better dysphagia
diagnostics, there is a critical need to establish reference values for VF swallowing measures across the healthy
age span. In our previous R01 (DC011020), we developed a rigorous method for measuring swallowing
physiology from VF: the Analysis of Swallowing Physiology: Events, Kinematics and Timing (ASPEKT
Method). We published initial ASPEKT reference values from 40 young healthy adults (<60 years) and
performed preliminary analyses to compare data from healthy older adults and small cohorts of adults with
dysphagia to these reference data. Through this renewal application, we will validate the ASPEKT Method
healthy reference values for swallowing across the adult life span, demonstrate scalability of the ASPEKT
Method across commonly used variations in clinical VF testing protocols, and profile swallowing
pathophysiology in clinical groups where dysphagia is a cause of morbidity to identify clinical decision points
that can be used for diagnosis and outcome measurement. Our vision is that the ASPEKT Method will enable
clinicians to compare patient measures to healthy reference values, facilitating quantification and evidence-
based interpretation of the presence, nature and severity of swallowing impairment. Ultimately, we seek to
generate data that will shift subjective dysphagia diagnostic practices toward a quantitative, evidence-based
diagnostic framework that will improve resource utilization, treatment planning and patient outcomes."

Collaborative Research (PAR-22-114) to support our UO1 grant (2UO1 CA199288-06, active till 06/2026) in the
NIH/NCI Pediatric Preclinical In Vivo Testing Program (PIVOT). Our objective is to characterize the racial/ethnic
nature of a panel of 165 patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (orthotopic PDX or PDOX) models of pediatric brain
tumors, to determine disparities in therapeutic responses among racial/ethnic groups, and to understand genetic
and epigenetic variations that contribute to such disparities. Our long-term goal is to include well-defined animal

 Brain tumor is the number one cause of cancer related death in children. Similar to many adult cancers,
health disparities have been identified. In addition to socioeconomic and socio-environmental factors, differences
of tumor biology may also play a role, as adult cancers have shown distinct gene expression, DNA methylation
and mutation profiles among racial/ethnic groups. Our hypothesis that the racial/ethnic-specific genetic
components contribute to cancer disparity of pediatric brain tumors and affect their responses to therapy. We
hypothesize that the inclusion of minority patient-derived PDOX models will further support the evaluation and
prioritization of racial/ethnic appropriate anti-cancer drugs. To test these hypotheses, we propose three Specific
Aims. Aim 1: Perform genetic ancestry analysis of our PDOX models to define their racial/ethnic origin.
We will supplement self-reported racial/ethnic information with genetic ancestry analysis with EthSEQ analysis
of RNAseq data and Infinium Global Screening Array (GCD) analysis to our existing PDOX models (including
the 101 models with self-reported racial/ethnic information) to achieve a complete and genetic-based
determination/inferrence of race/ethnicity of our model system. Aim 2: Determine the landscape of active
drugs against group 3 medulloblastoma in Black, Hispanic and White Children. We have 62 models of
medulloblastoma, including 43 models with self-reported race/ethnicity. Since group 3 is the most aggressive
subtype, we will a) complete a high throughput drug screening (8,000 drugs) in 10 models from Black, 10 from
Hispanic and 10 from White children, respectively; b) understand racial/ethnic-specific mechanisms of action by
correlating active drugs with the underlying genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. Aim 3. Integrate minority
derived PDOX models in future preclinical drug testing in NIH/NCI PIVOT program. We will add racial/ethnic
information as a new criteria of model selection to include minority derived PDOX models as often as possible.
Completion of this study will provide a large panel of animal models representing a diverse range of racial/ethnic
groups that can be widely distributed to facilitate biological studies of cancer disparity; and generate a catalog of
active anticancer drugs for Black, Hispanic and White children with group 3 medulloblastoma, which in turn
These findings will impact clinical trials by promoting the inclusion of race/ethnicity as an eligibility criterion."
10917945,"Abstract:
Opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality of AIDS patients in developing countries
and AIDS patients are susceptible to a number of cancers caused by opportunistic infections. Kaposi's Sarcoma
(KS) is the most common tumor of AIDS patients and is the among the most commonly reported tumor overall
in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where it commonly occurs in both HIV+ and HIV- people. The etiologic
agent of KS is Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV-8). KSHV is invariably found in the
main KS tumor cell, the spindle cell, where the virus is present predominantly in the latent state. Spindle cells
express markers of lymphatic endothelial cells and appear to be most closely aligned with this cell type. While
KSHV is clearly an oncogenic virus, little is known about the early steps of how KSHV infection of endothelial
cells leads to tumors. While there have been studies that have examined KSHV Induced immortalization and
transformation, there is a lack of tractable and reproducible relevant human cell system. We found that KSHV
infection of primary neonatal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) leads to bypass of senescence, the first step in
immortalization. We also demonstrated that the viral Cyclin homolog (vCyc) was essential for KSHV driven
proliferation past senescence. KSHV infected neonatal blood endothelial cells (BECs) senesced at the same
passage as uninfected blood or lymphatic endothelial cells indicating this phenotype is LEC specific. There is
not a strong interferon response in LECs following KSHV infection. In preliminary data we found that
knockout of STING in the BECs, preventing the IFN response, made them susceptible to KSHV induced
proliferation past senescence, indicating that STING or STING activated pathways prevent KSHV induced
proliferation past senescence. In this proposal we will determine if STING expression is sufficient for this
phenotype and the mechanism of STING inhibition of KSHV induced proliferation past senescence. We will
also determine the mechanism of vCyc activation of endothelial cells to proliferate past senescence. These data
provide a robust system for analyzing the mechanism of how KSHV drives the first step of oncogenesis in
endothelial cells and why it is specific to LECs. We will further study KSHV induced oncogenesis in our new
endothelial precursor cell (EPC) model. We previously found that EPCs isolated from human blood could be
separated into lymphatic like EPCs and blood like EPCs. We found that the Ly-EPCs were able to proliferate to
low levels in soft agar but uninfected Ly-EPCs and uninfected or KSHV infected Bl-EPCs could not. This
presents a second oncogenic assay for studying how KSHV activates cell proliferation in lymphatic endothelial
cells but not blood. Ultimately, the proposed studies will help identify how KSHV alters endothelial cells to
become cancer cells and ultimately KS tumors and help in the identification of novel therapeutic avenues for
KS cell proliferation."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Innate Immunity Across the Molecular,
Cellular, Tissue and Therapeutic, organized by Drs. Kate Jeffrey, Ramnik Xavier and Xu Zhou. The conference
will be held in Alberta, Canada from April 9–12, 2024.
Over three decades ago, Charles Janeway predicted that pathogen sensing was mediated by germline-encoded
pattern recognition receptors that detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Since
then, a multitude of endosomal and cytoplasmic sensors, their ligands and downstream signal transduction
pathways that initiate innate immunity have been defined. Emerging techniques such as cellular and spatial
transcriptomics are informing us where in the human body, and in what diverse disease contexts, these pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) and associated gene circuits are implicated. Furthermore, metabolic and chromatin
analyses are now illuminating acute and chronic adaptation of innate immune cell transcriptional programs. The
next frontier in innate immunity will be understanding how innate sensor-ligand interactions, and the individual
cellular programs that ensue, work in complex systems of tissue and microorganismal microenvironments. Of
particular importance will be grasping innate immunity resolution during homeostasis and how it can be
leveraged, or avoided, for the treatment of infectious, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and
oncological diseases. This conference will provide multidisciplinary perspectives on new horizons and
unexpected advances in innate immunity. The program will highlight innovative techniques and novel read outs
of innate immunity at the molecular, cellular and tissue level and examine the connections of innate immunity
with human health. The program will also take a deep dive into clinical aspects of disease and contemporary
drug discovery approaches to harness or regulate innate immune using pharmacologic approaches. This
conference is designed to be a unique forum for researchers from diverse and traditionally non-overlapping fields
(immunology, metabolism, artificial intelligence, drug discovery, structural biology), to build fresh ideas and
collaborations for the next chapter of innate immune discovery and translation. Finally, this conference is being
held concurrently with a Keystone Symposia meeting on Systems and Engineering Immunology, which will allow
attendees to interact with colleagues in a related area of immunology."
10908321,"Acute and chronic tendon injuries are among the most common musculoskeletal health problems. Typically, an
injured tendon experiences fibrotic scarring that leaves the tissue mechanically compromised and prone to
debilitating adhesions that impair joint function. In a fibrotic tendon scar, the cell-cell and paracrine signaling
between inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, and tendon fibroblasts activate the latter into
fibroproliferative myofibroblasts, ultimately differentiating into a senescent phenotype. Our previous studies
using next-generation sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis mechanistically linked fibrosis and
senescence in injured mouse tendons with TGF-beta activated mTOR signaling. To further elucidate this
pathology, the goal of this proposal is to engineer a microfluidic human tendon-on-chip (hToC) system and use
it to more accurately model the biological aspects of the inflammation and fibrosis in injured tendons. In the
UG3 phase of this proposal, the chip will be fabricated featuring a multicompartmental design and microfluidic
channels to incorporate a fibroblast-seeded collagen hydrogel and simulate vascular blood flow, respectively.
Ultrathin, highly permeable, and optically transparent porous silicon membranes (SiM) will separate the
hydrogel from circulation and provide a substrate for an endothelial barrier in between. The signaling between
the fibroblasts, hydrogel-resident- and circulating-macrophages, and endothelial cells will be enabled through
nanoporous SiM (~60 nm), while a microporous SiM (~ 8 µm) will allow extravasation of circulating
macrophages and infiltration of the hydrogel under TGF-beta stimulation. To allow for a patient-centric chip,
tendon fibroblasts will be used to create the tendon hydrogel and to reprogram donor-matching iPSCs to derive
the endothelial cells and macrophages, respectively. An additional innovation will be the integration of label-
free photonic sensors into the microfluidic device to allow on-chip sensing, which has been long appreciated as
a critical, unmet need for organ-on-chip devices. The UG3 studies will use the chip to validate the role of
mTOR in the disease model and identify biologically relevant biomarkers. In the UH3 phase, we will utilize the
chip as a pre-clinical trial platform for testing efficacy and safety of FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors as potential
disease modifying drugs, and as a drug screening platform to identify and prioritize safer and more potent
inhibitors of mTOR and senescence in tendon injury for clinical trials. To successfully complete this innovative
project, we have assembled a team of accomplished experts in tendon tissue engineering and surgery,
immunology, iPSC technology, GMP cell manufacturing, nano- and micro-fabrication, sensor technology, and
high throughput screening. The proposed studies will develop a human microphysiological system to catalyze
clinical trials and accelerate drug discovery for acute and chronic tendon injuries."
10908324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer screening is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), has the
potential to detect lung cancer at earlier, more treatable stages. However, population uptake of lung cancer
screening has been abysmal. It has been 7 years since the USPSTF released its official recommendation, yet
less than 5% of screening-eligible Americans have been screened. Screening-eligible individuals are generally
unaware about the option of finding lung cancer early through screening, and our team’s prior work revealed
that in addition to lack of awareness, screening-eligible individuals in the U.S. do not screen – when they are
aware – because of perceived barriers to screening. If high-risk patient populations are not aware that lung
cancer screening exists, then formative work is needed to increase awareness about screening. It is essential
to employ novel community-focused strategies to increase awareness about lung cancer screening to reach
diverse, screening-eligible individuals who might not otherwise learn about the option to screen. Our long term
goal is to increase screening uptake among appropriate, high-risk individuals nationwide. Our overall objective
in this application is to test the effectiveness of: 1) leveraging a social media-based platform to reach
screening-eligible individuals in the community upstream before they engage with the healthcare system, and
2) a novel, tailored health communication and decision support intervention related to lung cancer screening
(LungTalk). Our central hypothesis is two-fold: 1) Facebook targeted advertisement will be a successful
platform to reach high-risk individuals unaware of lung cancer screening; and 2) tailored compared to non-
tailored lung cancer screening information will increase knowledge and improve health beliefs about screening
and subsequent screening uptake. Our study is informed by our prior studies, which led us to consider the
importance of increasing awareness and knowledge on a population level from the screening-eligible
individuals’ perspective as a precursor to health behavior change. Successful use of Facebook to recruit
screening-eligible individuals in our prior studies also led us to consider how social media might be used to
increase awareness of lung cancer screening and as a platform to link the screening-eligible individual with a
tailored health communication and decision support intervention that has the potential to influence screening
behavior and uptake. Using a randomized controlled trial design, we will randomize 500 screening-eligible
individuals recruited through Facebook nationwide to receive either a tailored intervention (LungTalk) or non-
tailored ACS Lung Screening Informational Video. Specific aims are to (1) examine the use of a social media
platform to reach high-risk individuals eligible for lung screening; (2) compare the effectiveness of a computer-
tailored health communication tool to a web-based ACS Lung Screening Informational Video to improve lung
cancer screening: a) knowledge; b) health beliefs; and c) screening uptake and completion in a high-risk
population; and (3) Explore the sustainability of a social media-based approach among key stakeholders."
10908325,"In the past 40 years, the prevalence of obesity has increased at an alarming rate. Even modest weight loss of
at least 5% improves clinical parameters and quality of life. Efficacious behavioral weight loss programs teach
participants behavioral strategies to create and maintain a caloric deficit. The two strongest predictors of long-
term weight loss in such programs are initial weight loss and dietary self-monitoring. Over time, these
phenomena decline, limiting program effectiveness. Financial incentives to increase initial weight loss and self-
monitoring are appealing because they can be delivered to large populations with relative ease and at low cost.
Employers and payers have begun to provide financial incentives for health behaviors and outcomes despite
an inadequate evidence base to inform the optimal design of such interventions. The proposed study will
evaluate which incentive approach has the greatest impact and durability—incentivizing interim weight loss,
dietary self-monitoring, or both. Studies testing the effects of incentivizing these phenomena have showed
some promise for increasing short-term weight loss, but the effects have not been sustained. Furthermore, few
studies have evaluated incentive effects on long-term weight loss; examined the mediating role of intrinsic or
extrinsic motivation; or calculated program costs or cost-effectiveness of financial incentive interventions. In the
proposed two-site, randomized, single-blinded, longitudinal 2x2 factorial study, known as “Log2Lose,” we
address these limitations by evaluating the individual and joint effects of incentivizing, in near real-time, interim
weight loss and dietary self-monitoring on 6-month weight loss and subsequent weight loss maintenance.
People with obesity from the communities of Madison, WI and Durham, NC will receive an 18-month
intervention comprising: 1. An incentivized weight loss program for 6 months (Phase I), 2. An incentivized
weight maintenance program for 6 months (Phase II), and 3. A non-incentivized weight maintenance program
for 6 months (Phase III). Participants will be randomized to receive adjunctive incentives for weekly weight
loss, dietary self-monitoring, both, or neither. We will measure the proportion of participants achieving clinically
significant weight loss of ≥5% at 6 (primary endpoint), 12, and 18 months. We will assess whether extrinsic and
intrinsic motivation mediate intervention effect; calculate intervention costs; and calculate cost-effectiveness
ratios across the four study arms. Our financial incentives intervention was designed to be scalable by using
available technology and automating the process of analyzing data to provide incentives in near real-time. The
intervention could be paired with various weight loss interventions offered by clinicians or payers, or integrated
into a variety of patient and consumer-facing technologies. Completion of this study will contribute to our long-
term goal of identifying and implementing efficacious, cost-effective, scalable approaches to reduce the
prevalence of obesity and associated health outcomes."
10908436,"Osteoporotic fractures are a major public health problem, especially for older persons.
Bisphosphonates (BPs) are an inexpensive therapeutic class of drugs effective at preventing
these fractures. However, there has been a substantial decline in use of BPs for osteoporosis at
least in part because of concerns for rare, albeit potentially serious side effects, namely atypical
femoral fractures (AFF) and bisphosphonate medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw
(MRONJ). Duration of treatment is a risk factor for long-term side effects from BPs, including
AFF, and to a lesser extent, MRONJ. To assist with decision-making regarding duration of use
of BPs, the FDA and professional societies developed guidelines suggesting that after three to
five years of oral or three years of intravenous BP use, that reassessment of fracture risk with
possible provision of a drug holiday be done. However, these recommendations were based on
very limited evidence largely derived from white, healthy, community-dwelling postmenopausal
women. Moreover, the risk associated with drug holidays is uncertain, as emerging reports
suggest that a number of women have sustained osteoporotic fractures while off therapy. It is
paramount to better understand the risk-benefit profile of long-term BP therapy and drug
holidays, in both men and women, all races and ethnicities, and those with serious
comorbidities. To accomplish this, we have amassed an expert multidisciplinary team to study
large and diverse patient populations ranging from community dwelling to long-term care
residents from Kaiser Permanente (KP; Northern California, Georgia, and Mid-Atlantic regions),
Health Partners (HP; Minnesota), and the national Veterans Health Administration (VHA),
spanning 30 years (1996 to 2025) and including over half a million older U.S. adults who
initiated osteoporosis treatment with a BP. Utilizing this population, we will determine risks and
benefits, health care costs and cost effectiveness of uninterrupted continuation of BPs versus
BP drug holidays. These information will be utilized to develop a risk factor calculator to
determine if a drug holiday should be done (Calculator for Length of use of Bisphosphonates
(CLUB)). An expert panel including both clinician and consumer voices will inform the final
design of CLUB. We anticipate that CLUB will be a clinically useful point-of-care tool to guide
shared decision-making on BP use and optimize care for older patients at risk for fracture."
10908439,"Every year, 15 million babies are born premature. Over 75% of preterm births (PTBs) are termed spontaneous
(sPTB) resulting in parturition at early gestational time points without clear causes. Our lack of understanding
of the mechanisms and overall pathogenesis that promotes sPTB results in limited successful interventions.
While uterine contractility and cervical remodeling appear to be obligatory processes in parturition, premature
triggers of these processes remain poorly elucidated. Recent studies reveal close associations between
cervicovaginal (CV) microbial communities and the occurrence of sPTB. In particular, we recently studied a
cohort of 2000 pregnant women and assessed the CV microbial communities, metabolic and immune
responses early in pregnancy, providing strong evidence that colonization with specific bacterial taxa, specific
metabolic profiles, and local immune responses were strongly associated with sPTB. However, to develop
preventive or therapeutic strategies, understanding the cause of sPTB is essential. We speculate that interplay
between the CV microbial communities, local immune response and the cervical and vaginal epithelial barriers
induce premature cervical remodeling and initiate sPTB. The overall goal of this study is to define how specific
CV bacteria interact with vaginal and epithelial cells in clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo models and to
understand how those interactions modify tissue remodeling and biomechanics of the pregnant cervix, driving
sPTB. We propose a process whereby bacterial taxa that are highly associated with sPTB in humans provoke
exfoliation of the vaginal epithelium. This process promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from both
vaginal and cervical epithelial cells. While activation of EMT prevents the ascension of these bacteria, a
tradeoff is that EMT fosters breakdown of the extracellular matrix in the cervical tissue, triggering premature
cervical remodeling and sPTB. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that specific bacteria, such as
Gardnerella vaginalis (G.vaginalis) and Mobiluncus mulieris (M. Mulieris), promote EMT of the vaginal and
cervical epithelial barrier which alters the structure and function of the pregnant cervix, leading to sPTB, even
in the absence of ascending infection (above the cervix). This paradigm-shifting hypothesis will be tested
through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. This proposal will first address whether ascension of
bacteria into the uterus is actually necessary for PTB to occur; these studies have the potential to reframe our
scientific and therapeutic approach to PTB. We will then demonstrate how bacteria induce EMT in CV epithelial
barriers and how EMT might promote premature cervical remodeling. Unique to this proposal, we will provide
quantitative assessment of the pregnant cervix, in terms of structure and function, in a mouse model of PTB. A
multidisciplinary team adds rigor to our work by applying novel concepts and techniques to the study of sPTB.
These studies will provide insight as to new and focused therapeutic targets to limit or prevent sPTB and will
significantly advance this field."
10908532,"Abstract
Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) causes endothelial inflammation and microvascular rarefaction that leads to
adverse kidney graft outcomes in organ transplant. Direct treatment of endothelial cells (EC) can reduce the
impact of IRI on the health of the graft, but there is a lack of EC targeted therapies that can effectively
intervene and alleviate the various modes of dysfunctional endothelial response. The goal of this work is to
develop a therapeutic strategy that addresses the two key modes of endothelial damage in response to IRI:
dysfunctional inflammation in ECs and damage to capillary networks, in a site-specific and temporary manner.
We propose that therapeutic siRNA can be delivered directly to endothelial cells using polymeric nanoparticles
(NPs), which provide a customizable platform to enhance the cell penetration and to sustain the delivery of
nucleic acids. In Aim 1, we will determine the NP characteristics utilizing a novel family of PACE polymers that
enable maximum and sustained siRNA to endothelial cells in order to reduce adhesion molecule expression
upon inflammatory activation. In Aim 2, we will translate this knowledge of structure/function relationship of the
NP to rationally design siRNA-mediated knockdown of adhesion molecules in relevant models of 3D human
vasculature and evaluate the long-term effect after transplantation in vivo. In the R00 phase of the award, the
principles determined in Aim 1 and 2 to impact endothelial-NP interaction will be applied to polymer NPs
delivered within a hydrogel delivery vehicle to the renal cortex. Aim 3 will investigate the potential of
endothelial-tailored siRNA-NPs to locally deliver anti-fibrotic siRNAs within an ECM-derived hydrogel to IRI-
damaged renal cortex in vivo.
Dr. Laura Bracaglia has earned her PhD in Bioengineering and is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the
Department of Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. In her training so far, she has studied NP and drug
delivery methods in human tissue models that provide translatable insights into vascular inflammation. To
successfully accomplish the specific aims of this proposal, Dr. Bracaglia has identified that she will need
additional training in the 1) chemical and polymer science aspects involved in the development of NPs. In
addition, the impact of the proposed work would be enhanced with training and expertise in 2) vascular
immune biology, 3) renal pathology and response to injury, and 4) translation to human immunology. To train in
these areas, Dr. Bracaglia has assembled a team of expert mentors who can provide clinical perspective and
technical expertise. In addition, she has planned key course work and set milestones for progress in scientific
and professional goals. This proposed training in the K99 mentored phase will support meeting the initial goals
of this work. NP treatment strategies developed during the mentored phase, together with her expertise in the
development of ECM-based biomaterials, will support the final aim of this proposal (R00)."
10908535,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are currently limited treatments available to treat non-operable brain cancers, and none
that meaningfully extend the lifespan of patients. Imaging these diffuse tumors is also a challenge,
and current fluorescent probes emit in wavelengths with high biological background fluorescence.
This proposal describes the development of novel dye molecules that emit in the near-infrared II
(NIR-II)/shortwave infrared (SWIR) region (1000 – 2000 nm). Within the NIR-II/SWIR region,
higher resolution images are found at longer wavelengths. No small molecule emitters have peak
emission beyond 1400 nm and only one known molecule has peak emission >1250 nm. We have
preliminarily synthesized two fluorescent materials with emission maxima conservatively
projected at ~1700 nm and >1900 nm. These dyes offer the ability to see further into the SWIR
region than any other reported organic small molecules where image resolution is the highest.
Additionally, we proposed to synthesize materials with shorter wavelength emission than these
materials >2000 nm where imaging depth and contrast both are suggested to continually improve
based on the current literature. In order to effectively deliver the dye molecules into the brain, we
have to encapsulate them into nanocarriers. Linear-dendritic block-copolymers (LDBCs)
represent a highly functionalizable material for drug delivery vehicles. Its dual linear/dendritic
nature makes it excellent at encapsulating a variety of molecules. We use biocompatible ionic
liquids (ILs), molten salts comprised of asymmetric cations and anions, to `tune' the affinity of
nanoparticles to different cell types. Using this strategy, we have developed an IL that promotes
nanoparticle `hitchhiking' on erythrocytes to deliver them to the brain, and achieves cell-selective
targeting of microglia once delivered to the central compartment. Preliminary data in rats
demonstrate ~48% of injected nanoparticles accumulating in the brain within 6 hours, a vast
improvement over current nanoparticle delivery strategies. To this end, we will (Aim 1) generate
a library of novel NIR-II candidates, in addition to our current leads, that show peak emission at
1700 – 2000 nm, package them into LDBCs, and coat the nanoparticles with ILs. We will measure
their photophysical properties and confirm the preference that ILs confer to murine and human
blood components as potential cargo carriers. (Aim 2) We will assess the safety (subacute, acute,
subchronic, reproductive, mutagenic) and biodistribution of up to 5 leading formulations in rats,
and capture high-resolution live brain imaging. (Aim 3) Lead candidates (based on CNS
distribution and photophysical properties) will be assessed in vitro and in vivo in a xenografted
glioblastoma rat model."
10908538,"ABSTRACT
Every year, 130 million women deliver babies around the world, and an estimated 14 million experience
postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) − recently redefined as a cumulative blood loss of 1000 ml or more or blood loss
associated with signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, irrespective of the route of delivery. PPH is the leading
cause of maternal mortality worldwide, responsible for 25% of maternal deaths from obstetric causes, with 99%
occurring in low and lower-middle income countries (LMICs). The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony
− when the uterus fails to adequately contract after childbirth − accounting for 70% of all PPH. Active
management of the third stage of labor, consisting of administering prophylactic uterotonics, controlled cord
traction, and uterine massage, reduces the incidence of PPH by approximately 66%. When PPH occurs in spite
of these preventive measures, therapeutic options include additional uterotonics (medical), uterine tamponade
(mechanical) and surgical interventions (vascular ligation, uterine compression sutures and hysterectomy).
Uterine balloon tamponade is often the second line therapy when medical management is unsuccessful and is
achieved with inflatable devices inserted into the uterus to exert outward compression on the uterine
walls. Despite its widespread use, its mechanism is counterintuitive to the physiologic uterine contraction that
occurs after delivery to control bleeding. Its use is further limited by prolonged treatment times (typically 12-24
hours), urinary tract occlusion, and inability to reveal any continuing bleeding. Low-cost options − most commonly
condom catheters − are used in LMICs, but two recent randomized trials showed no improvement in maternal
outcomes and possible harm. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective and safe treatment options to reduce
the burden of PPH particularly in LMICs.
The Jada® System is a novel FDA-cleared intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device specifically
designed for rapid treatment of PPH. It mimics postpartum physiology by applying low-level intrauterine negative
pressure to facilitate uterine compressive forces for constriction of blood vessels to achieve hemostasis.
Preliminary data from two studies have shown promising results, but these data are limited by lack of control
groups, possible selection bias and the modest sample sizes which preclude definitive conclusions regarding
the relative effectiveness and safety of the Jada® System. We propose the first definitive, randomized control
trial to test the hypothesis that the Jada® System is effective, safe and cost-effective in treating PPH, compared
to standard care. A multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in obstetrics, global health and clinical
trials will enroll 424 women in two high volume obstetric units in Ghana, a LMIC with high PPH burden, to evaluate
the effectiveness (Primary Aim), 2) safety (Secondary Aim 1), and 3) cost-effectiveness (Secondary Aim 2)
of the Jada® System, compared to standard care, in treating PPH."
10908541,"In addition to playing a crucial role in physiological processes such as digestion of food, gut 
microbes also provide a low-grade stimulation of the intestinal immune system, which contains the 
majority of the lymphocytes and antibodies in the body. Colonization by gut microbiota 
influences adaptive immunity, in large part via gut- associated secondary lymphoid 
structures including gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) and Peyer patches (PPs). In 
turn, the gut-associated adaptive immune system provides crucial resistance mechanisms against 
enteric infections, but also represents a major regulator of the microbiota composition itself, in 
part via secretion of antibodies. However, how antibody formation and secretion in the intestine is 
regulated by, and regulate the microbiome is incompletely understood. Particularly, it remains 
unclear how naturally-occurring gut- associated germinal centers (gaGCs), essential structures 
 for B cell receptor affinity maturation and class switching, deal with the plethora of 
luminal antigens or in turn, develop in their absence. In our previous work and preliminary 
presented here, we demonstrate lines of evidence supporting the relevance and feasibility of the 
proposed studies. First, we developed a multicolor fate-mapping using ""Brainbow"" alleles 
as a system to measure the extent of positive GC selection (and thus of affinity maturation) in 
single GCs with high throughput. Second, we present data with supportive evidence of strong 
selection towards monoclonality, as well as affinity- based selection in gaGCs in the steady state. 
Third, by re-deriving our Brainbow mice into our existing GF facility, and by analyzing clonal 
dynamics and winner clones under absence of gut microbiota, we found that gaGCs are still 
abundantly observed in GF conditions, surprisingly consisting of highly public clonotypes 
 that undergo extraordinarily fast positive selection. We thus hypothesize that, despite the 
enormous antigenic diversity of the gut, affinity maturation towards commensals does take place in 
the physiology. In Aims 1&2, we propose to leverage the ability to readily identify ""winner"" B 
cell clones afforded by the Brainbow system (Aim 1) to isolate B cell clones with strong affinity 
maturation to steady state commensals, as a tool to gain insight into the basic biology underlying 
the clonal dynamics of gaGCs and the mucosal antibody response in general (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we 
propose to investigate the biology of the unusual GCs observed in GF mice to determine 
the origin, specificity, and function of public B cell clones that dominate the intestinal 
response in the absence of microbiota. By combining our complementary expertise in gut (Mucida lab) 
and B cell biology (Victora lab), with gnotobiotic and state-of-the-art imaging, single-cell 
sequencing, biochemical and microbiology approaches, we seek to determine the influence of 
the microbiome on B cell selection, antibody affinity maturation and class switching in the 
intestine; as well as the mechanisms that govern these processes in the absence of microbial 
stimulation."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Cardiovascular Epigenetics and Gene
Regulation, organized by Drs. Roger Foo, Federica Accornero and Enzo Porrello. The conference will be held
in Hannover, Germany from April 15–18, 2024.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can unexpectedly reduce the life expectancy among young, healthy adults and
can also cause debilitating, chronic conditions later in life, presenting a concerning health impact in our aging
population. Further, it is a significant cause of death worldwide, claiming the lives of 17.9 million annually. As a
result, there is an ongoing need to reduce the impact of CVD through basic and translational research. In parallel,
emerging discoveries in epigenetics and epitranscriptomics have defined gene regulatory circuits—enforced by
chromatin or nucleic acid modifications and the enzymes that maintain them—that modulate cellular states.
These pathways, when perturbed, have demonstrated links to numerous diseases. While several epigenetic
targets have shown promise in cancer, emerging research in myocardial cells and cardiovascular systems has
hinted that these gene regulatory pathways may offer new therapeutic opportunities for combatting CVD. This
Keystone Symposia conference was designed to unite investigators from across the vascular and cardiac fields
with researchers focused on understanding epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulatory mechanisms. The
program focuses on mechanisms of CVD pathophysiology and potential links to gene expression pathways and
explores how known CVD-linked factors (metabolism, inflammation, etc.) might tie into epigenetic regulation in
cardiovascular systems. This conference will offer a unique opportunity to bring together two divergent groups
of researchers to explore the connections between CVD and epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulatory
mechanisms with an aim to define potentially new therapeutic approaches in this area."
10917088,"The medical, social, and economic burdens that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the prodromal stage of this
pathology, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), place on Veterans has stimulated efforts to identify therapeutic
targets to modify their progression. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to vascular abnormalities in AD,
a deficiency in endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to the production and accumulation of AD-
related neurotoxins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). As challenges, which we are uniquely poised to overcome,
have deterred the in vivo assessment of cerebral endothelial function and NO bioavailability, it is unclear if
these factors are, indeed, attenuated in AD. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to determine if endothelial
function is related to AD severity by measuring the change in cerebral blood flow elicited by the intravenous
infusion of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) to directly assess cerebral
NO bioavailability in patients with AD, MCI, and cognitively-normal age and sex matched controls. We also
propose to determine if simpler, non-invasive assessments of peripheral endothelial function are good
surrogates for cerebral endothelial function. The second aim of this study will determine the role of endothelial
function and NO bioavailability in AD progression by longitudinally assessing and comparing the change in
endothelial function (cerebral and peripheral) to the change in cognitive function over the course of 18 months
in patients with MCI and age and sex matched controls. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed studies is to
better understand the role of the vascular endothelium in AD severity and progression to determine if cerebral

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and death. Despite the progress in unraveling
the genetic basis of DCM, there is a lack of disease-modifying therapies that target the underlying genetic
etiology. In preliminary studies, we identified the transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as a potential target for therapeutic
interventions in genetic DCM. ATF4 is a critical factor mediating the integrated stress response; an adaptive
pathway activated in response to stress. ATF4 is selectively translated in response to specific forms of cellular
stress to induce the expression of genes involved in adaptation to stress. Here we propose a multidisciplinary
approach to explore the potential role of ATF4-mediated regulation of one-carbon metabolism in cardiac
physiology and develop novel mutation-agnostic gene therapy for DCM. In Aim 1, we will test whether ATF4
overexpression can rescue the contractility deficit, a hallmark of DCM, in a mutation-agnostic manner using
iPSC-CMs derived for patients carrying DCM-causing mutation in diverse gene ontologies. In Aim 2, we will
examine the potential role of ATF4-mediated regulation of one-carbon metabolism gene expression in
cardiomyocyte function. In Aim 3, we will use AAV-mediated overexpression of ATF4 in vivo and test whether
ATF4 signaling could reverse or halt the progression of DCM in vivo. Unlike conventional gene therapies, our
approach does not replace a faulty or missing gene. Instead, our approach aims at triggering a cardioprotective
effect by bolstering the ATF4-dependent one-carbon metabolism gene expression in the heart. We hope to
provide proof-of-concept for a new clinically relevant therapeutic strategy, paving the way for mutation-agnostic
treatments for genetic DCM. Such treatments are likely to apply to other types of cardiac diseases such as heart
failure."
10925415,"The proposed project is in the field of thoracic oncology. Lung cancer patients that get treated with
radiotherapy and immunotherapy are at risk of developing serious lung side-effects, and in particular,
pneumonitis. Pneumonitis results in cough, shortness of breath, and can be fatal. Pneumonitis, is a serious,
overlapping toxicity that can results as a function of both radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Pneumonitis has a
significant impact on patient quality of life and limits the aggressive combinations of therapies that can be
evaluated in clinical trials. Strategies are needed that can reduce pneumonitis rates for patients treated with
aggressive combinations of radiotherapy and immunotherapy in clinical trials. A novel lung function imaging
modality has been developed that uses data acquired as part of routine clinical care for lung cancer patients
along with software techniques to innovatively calculate lung function maps. The novel lung function imaging
modality has been incorporated into radiotherapy through a personalized, functional avoidance radiation
treatment paradigm. The idea of functional avoidance is to design radiation treatment plans that reduce dose to
functional portions of the lung with the hypothesis that reduced dose to functional lung will lead to decreased
side-effects from treatment and improved quality of life. Imaging-based functional avoidance provides a
promising method for significantly reducing toxicity for lung cancer patients who get treated with combinations of
radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The problem is that the novel lung function imaging methods have not been
developed and evaluated with immunotherapy added to the treatment paradigm.
 The purpose of our project is to develop novel methods that enable the evaluation of imaging-based
functional avoidance for patients enrolled in radiotherapy and immunotherapy clinical trials. Our study will
develop methods that provide a complete picture of lung function (perfusion imaging in addition to ventilation),
evaluate the most stable and clinically relevant form of lung function imaging, and perform a sensitivity analysis
of how various functional parameters effect radiation treatment plans for patients treated with radiotherapy and
immunotherapy. Our study will use data from 4 clinical trials to evaluate whether the proposed imaging framework
can reduce toxicity for lung cancer patients in the setting of immunotherapy added to the treatment paradigm.
 More aggressive combinations of radiotherapy and immunotherapy are going to continue to evolve and
be investigated in clinical trials. Pulmonary toxicity will be a serious clinical limitation for these studies. Our project
proposes a convenient, inexpensive imaging modality to reduce toxicity and has the potential to significantly
improve quality of life of lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The impact of our
imaging framework is that it can 1) reduce treatment-related side-effects for patients treated with radiotherapy
and immunotherapy and 2) enable the investigation of more-aggressive radiotherapy and immunotherapy
treatment approaches for lung cancer patients."

10918139,"Data Science Core - Abstract
Achieving the scientific goals of the Overall Research Strategy requires a significant effort and advancement in
data science for neuroscience. In particular, scientific progress depends on novel experimental design, data
collection and processing (as described in Projects 1, 2, and 3), and novel analysis and models (as described in
Projects 1, 2, and 3), which lead to general principles to be tested (as described in Projects 2 and 3). The
fundamental goal of the Data Science Core is to accelerate the process connecting the raw data collected in all
three Projects to the analyses used to obtain data derivatives, which can then be used to build models across
all three Projects, and validated via electron microscopy (EM) in Project 3. The two main challenges we face to
accelerate these links are big data and reproducibility. First, the data collected are too large to fit into memory,
or even on disk, with each experiment ordering on one terabyte (TB), and the entire dataset amassing hundreds
of TB or more. Therefore, the classic paradigm of using MATLAB for all analyses that are stored locally is not
sufficient. The solution to this is twofold: 1) build scalable algorithms, so that different individuals can apply them
to these big data, and 2) develop cloud data management systems, so that all consortium members can quickly
access and analyze the data, and then integrate them with one another. The cloud data management system
will be built on the infrastructure developed for the Open Connectome Project1, originally developed to host data
on institutional resources, and ZBrain 2.0, a resource we are developing to define a common coordinate space
for zebrafish brain atlasing. Second, this is a team effort, so sharing analyses and derivatives and keeping track
of metadata will be important. The solution to this is threefold: 1) build a comprehensive scientific environment
in the cloud, that enables sharing of entire “digital experiments”, linking to the data and ensuring that the entire
analysis pipeline can be trivially run and extended by anyone and anywhere, 2) carefully curating data and
metadata in existing resources, and 3) facilitating the integration of different imaging datasets to improve ZBrain
2.0. Our entire system is built on and will continue to be open source, portable and reproducible, and will use
and extend best practices of data science and FAIR (
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable)2
data
management. Completing all the aims in this Data Science Core will not only enable and accelerate the scientific
progress addressed by this proposal, it will establish new standards in data science that can be immediately
applied to all other U19 efforts, as well as many other efforts within and outside NIH and even the international
science effort at large."
10918143,"Electron Microscopy Core
The synaptic circuits that underlie vertebrate behavior are of interest to all of the investigators on this grant (and
neuroscientists more generally). Generating neural circuits in zebrafish is the principal goal of this core. Getting this
connectivity entails revealing four essential features of neural circuitry for each neuron: first, rendering its local input at
sufficient resolution to detect all the impinging synaptic connections, second, identifying the sign of these connections,
third, identifying the cells giving rise to this presynaptic input and fourth, identifying the postsynaptic cells innervated by
this neuron's axon. Ideally, these requirements need to be met for all the neurons in one vertebrate brain because without
this information, neuroscientists cannot accurately trace signals, synapse by synapse, from sensory input to motor output
-- a profound impediment to deciphering of how a brain's structure relates to its behavioral repertoire. Owing to the rapid
pace of technological and computational improvements, it is now feasible for the first time to create a whole vertebrate
animal connectional map. The methods we will use automate a serial section electron microscopy pipeline so that high
resolution (nanoscale) images can be acquired over large (millimeter scale) volumes. This core will use a modern
serial-section multibeam scanning electron microscopy approach that we have been developing for about 10 years 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and combine this acquisition workflow with sophisticated image processing, leveraging machine learning
expertise and infrastructure at Google, the Advanced Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins, ground truth and proofreading taking
place in the Outreach and Training Core and the proofreading and manual tracing described in Project 3. One major
purpose of this Core is to assure that we do this integration successfully. One important aspect of this integration that will
make the connectional map more useful analytically, will be to oversee the technical aspects of the overlay of essential
fluorescence microscopy data derived from the same fish. This light microscopy-based data reveals whether neurons are
excitatory or inhibitory and the activity patterns of neurons during eight behaviors. We believe this Correlated Light and
Electron Microscopy (CLEM) will add powerful new dimensions to the analysis of the wiring diagram of a behaving
vertebrate."
10918146,"The Training and Outreach Core
We propose to create a new “Training and Outreach Core'' which will take advantage of the diverse scientific
directions and technologies represented by our team, as well as the unique properties of the larval zebrafish as
model organisms for outreach and training. The mission of this core is to increase diversity and support
trainees in scientific research. This mission will be carried out by three interlaced programs - Summer
Connectomics Internship for Outreach Neuroscience (SCION), BioBus, and Postbac Life Science Fellowship
(PLSF). The SCION and PLSF programs integrate students with the U19 research projects and shape them
into competent scientific contributors through an active learning framework. The two programs lower the barrier
to science research by engaging underrepresented students who do not have research experience and who
would otherwise not consider scientific research. SCION recruits motivated high school and college students
as contributors to mapping the zebrafish nervous system, combining citizen science with education and career
development. PLSF fellows will be primarily recruited from historically black colleges and universities, and will
be trained and integrated within a U19 research project with high likelihood of publication. The program places
emphasis on work experience and engages postbacs who want to pursue a profession in the life sciences, but
lack laboratory experience. The BioBus program interfaces with the local K12 schools to engage middle and
high school students with zebrafish neuroscience and to promote STEM education. It serves as a recruitment
pipeline for SCION and for the training of postdocs and graduate students as Outreach Fellows. BioBus and
SCION both provide frameworks for education and training of graduate students and postdocs in outreach,
pedagogy, project management and public speaking. In turn, these pedagogical and mentorship experiences
compel the postdocs and graduate students to regularly reevaluate their own research projects, becoming
better scientists by teaching."
10918147,"Project 1
At home in the Ganges, zebrafish are faced with specific challenges that are idiosyncratic to the environment they
evolved in. On a typical day, a larval zebrafish will have to navigate moving water currents and prevent getting swept
into unknown territory, it might have to avoid hypoxia and desiccation in overcrowded shallows, it could get physically
trapped in cul-de-sacs, and it will need to find and hunt potentially elusive prey. Its behavioral strategies, both
exteroceptive and interoceptive, play major roles in determining its evolutionary fitness in this environment.
Inspired by the elegance and generality of the solutions a zebrafish finds to these challenges in nature, we have designed
a series of behavioral assays that emulate such ethologically relevant conditions under controlled laboratory settings, and
which allow us to extract the computational algorithms. For example, we have shown that fish perform temporal
integration over noisy stimuli in the context of the coherent-dot optomotor reflex (cdOMR)1, we found that they calculate
spatial integrals along their lateral line to estimate velocity gradients in the context of rheotaxis2, and that they silence
self-induced and expected incoming somatosensory flow signals during swims and thereby protect their sensitive hair
cells from these large perturbations3. Here, we propose to extend these ongoing analyses and to add additional behavioral
paradigms where potentially conflicting sensory inputs are delivered simultaneously, and where the animal is forced to
make decisions between mutually exclusive motor outputs.
To go beyond these fast algorithmic computations, and in order to explicitly engage the autonomic regulation of internal
states, we will challenge the animal with a variety of aversive conditions, including exposure to threats such as hypoxia
or high salt4, or the frustration that occurs when an animal's motion is futile and they give up5,6. This second set of
behavioral challenges and related analyses requires the inclusion of longer time constants into our modeling framework.
They also are known to involve modulation of cardiac responses in addition to updating the animal's behavioral output,
which makes them well suited to investigate the regulation of autonomic and interoceptive states.
Our overall goal is to create comprehensive models of animal behavior by devising probabilistic algorithms that model
motor and cardiac responses to a variety of sensory inputs. We are including cardiac (and in some cases respiratory)
activity because these serve as indicators of internal states7 that must otherwise be surmised as hidden modifiers of brain
function, but also because they offer a readout for how sensory input affects internal homeostasis.
In order to adapt our experimental approach to the resolution and control required by each specific behavioral assay, we
have designed several open and closed loop configurations in arenas of various spatial scales, as well as fully immersive
virtual reality settings for tethered preparations. We hope these studies will advance our understanding of the algorithms
that relate and interconnect environmental and internal context to behavioral output, where we define behavioral output
operationally both in the classical - exteroceptive - sense as the total movements made by the intact animal 8, as well as at
the interoceptive level9."
10918149,"Project 2
It is the behavioral algorithms that dictate the questions and framework for any model of neural implementation. Thus, to
discover how behavioral algorithms are implemented and to generate a realistic brain-body circuit model for larval
zebrafish, we need, in addition to knowledge about the anatomical structure of the circuits, detailed information about
neural activity patterns during behavior. Further, behavioral algorithms must be implemented in the context of the
embodied animal, which is subject to physiological demands, fluctuations and constraints. In order to accommodate both
of these requirements, we will estimate and incorporate these physiological state variables into our modeling framework.
In order to obtain the necessary datasets, we propose to add detailed measurements of heart and gills, as well as body wide
recordings from the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) to our
experimental repertoire. Such recordings will be combined with established brain wide imaging technologies, where we
will focus on critical regions, such as the hypothalamus and various other areas that were already identified to play an
important role in the modulation of behaviors and internal states. To facilitate the quantification and control of
state-dependent variability, we have also designed a set of behavioral assays where environmental context is modulated to
induce specific changes in the animal's internal and autonomic state.
The comprehensive data sets collected in these experiments then allow for the generation of a family of realistic circuit
models that could, in principle, implement the behavioral algorithms and that can reproduce and emulate the recorded
neural and cardiac activity patterns. These realistic models allow for the generation of specific predictions and hypotheses
about many of the unconstrained parameters in the underlying circuits. Such parameters include specific connectivity
patterns, the synaptic weights, the excitability of membranes and many more. In order to constrain this large variety of
variables one needs to apply a variety of independent approaches. To that end we will take advantage of the extensive
experimental toolset already developed in the context of the current U19 grant, which includes the use of optogenetics
based circuit interrogation, targeted electrophysiology and sparse connectomics tracing in overlaid EM volumes. Many of
these experimental approaches require tethered behavioral preparations which are already established in our laboratories.
Such preparations provide the ideal setting for brain wide imaging and targeted perturbation, and they will therefore
facilitate the generation of a further refined set of validated circuit models for our various behavioral assays.
To summarize, our goal is to first validate and constrain a set of realistic circuit models that we have already generated in
the context of the current U19, to integrate these validated models with a novel framework we will generate for the
animal's autonomic state, and ultimately to combine all of them into a composite realistic multiscale circuit model of the
zebrafish brain and body. This multiscale circuit model will describe how all sensory stimuli, from the outside world as
well as from inside the body, are encoded and transformed into distributed neural activity that generates the motor
sequences that constitute the final output of the system."
10918151,"The primary goal of this COSMIIC HORNET project is to enable the research field to not only have
access to new implantable technology, but also, where possible, to establish the ability to modify and innovate
around that implantable technology. In order to achieve this goal, it is absolutely necessary that the COSMIIC
HORNET project is directly applicable to the bioelectronic research community and provides the appropriate
resources. To achieve this, we have formed a team of over 30 experts in neural interface technologies and
their clinical applications. This “Beekeeper Team” will provide administrative oversight for the project.
 A key feature of our Beekeeper core is that it has broad representation of the spectrum of clinical
applications for our implantable open source neuromodulation technology. The long-term objective of this
project is widespread use of the COSMIIC modules to develop new medical treatments for a wide range of
applications. This requires a focus on early dissemination and sustainability. The administration of this project
will therefore have the following three specific aims:
 Aim 1) Ensure the widespread utility of the novel modules. The beekeepers will provide feedback on
novel designs early in the design process to ensure that the device specifications and modes of operation will
serve a wide community of users. In conjunction with an external advisory board, the administrative team will
also monitor progress on the scheduled project milestones.
 Aim 2) Evaluate the distributed resources for completeness and safe ethical use. The COSMIIC
HORNET modules will be designed for use by research teams with strong engineering expertise, who must
have a thorough understanding of the devices they will use. The Beekeeper team will evaluate design and
regulatory documentation prior to distribution to the public
 Aim 3) Create a community of early adopters who can serve as a resource for others. Each beekeeper
has a personal interest in using this technology for their own research. During the course of this project, they
will lay the groundwork for that use at the end of three years through FDA communications and grant
applications. Each of the application represented by the beekeepers has a larger community of scientists who
may benefit from using these devices. Beekeepers will serve as an ambassador for these novel devices within
that community and we will also support and incorporate additional users who wish to become early adopters.
 At the end of this project, the existing modules already in human use will be fully open-sourced
including all regulatory communications. Novel designs will be complete, and well documented. There will also
be an online community of users at a variety of stages of adoption."
10918154,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Networked Neural Prosthesis (NNP), which forms the basis of the COSMIIC library, is already in use in
people with spinal cord injuries and provides a range of recording and stimulation capabilities. Implanting
multiple modules at the same time enables 10+ channel operation. However, many applications simply require
higher channel count modules for when there is a multichannel electrode array in one location (e.g. Utah
arrays, ECoG style cardiac electrodes, multicontact C-FINE nerve cuffs, spinal paddle electrodes, etc.). The
goal of this NEST, entitled High-density Interconnects with Variable Electronics or “HIVE”, is to design a high
channel count general purpose device for both recording and stimulation. Our team has the unique expertise to
complete this task. The existing NNP provides a great deal of reusable circuitry, and the Chestek Lab has
already designed a 96-channel NNP recording module that is in use in weekly monkey experiments. Medical
device packaging and validation testing experts Drs. Doug Shire and Janet Gbur, meanwhile, have developed
world-leading high-density hermetic packaging for visual prosthetics and Nano-Jet aerosol-3D printed
connector/lead assemblies. We will achieve our goal in the following three specific aims: Aim 1) Create and
validate an electronics module for 64 channel recording. We will design and validate modular circuitry for
64-channel recording, based on our previous published NNP module (Bullard et al. 2019) using microchips
from Intan Technologies. Aim 2) Create and validate a general purpose 64-channel package. We will
create a general purpose 64-channel package compatible with the NNP network, only slightly larger than
existing modules. We will achieve this by using multiple commercial off the shelf 8 channel feedthroughs within
the same welded titanium package. This package will be usable with hardwired connections, and we will also
develop a novel connector system for up to 64 channels. Aim 3) Create and validate a module for 32
channel stimulation and recording. There are many applications that would benefit from higher channel
count stimulation as well as simultaneous recording and stimulation on the same electrodes. Therefore, we will
design and validate modular circuitry for a 32-channel bidirectional module. After we are done, there will be a
catalog of high channel count implantable device components that can be adopted in whole or in part by
academic users or even startup medical companies looking for an initial foothold for a new application. These
designs will be fully documented, including the supply chain, with the verification and validation tests results
and design files provided publicly online."
10918157,"The goal of this Nest is to facilitate research teams’ development and implementation of implantable
sensors. Many research teams developing specialized sensors do not have the expertise in-house to develop
human grade implants and to transition to testing in human subjects. As part of the Cleveland Open Source
Modular Interoperable Implantable Community (COSMIIC), we will simplify and streamline this process for
research groups by developing the Sensor Withdrawn from A Remote Module (SWARM). The SWARM
System consists of a sensor agnostic module, the SWARM Host, that will communicate with an arbitrary
outlying sensor, the SWARM Sensor, based on the clinical need and targeted function. As part of the COSMIIC
ecosystem, teams can take advantage of the SWARM Host, power module (PM), and all of the other NNP
platform hardware and software protocols, and focus development on a new SWARM sensor for internal health
monitoring or other applications. Incorporating stimulation modules will enable closed loop control when
clinically appropriate. This project will thereby enhance the development process for other teams and enable
more rapid implementation in people with clinical needs.
 In addition to facilitating development, the proposed modularity enables sensor placement in locations
of the body that would be impractical for a full remote module. For example, sensors could be placed in the
distal extremities to measure foot and hand movement to support feedback control. Alternatively, sensors
could be placed deeper into the body, on the heart, lungs, stomach, or other organs as part of an implanted
system regulating autonomic function.
 This project will develop the SWARM Host and a single SWARM Sensor as a proof of concept. The
SWARM Host will utilize the same packaging as existing remote modules, minimizing additional development.
In this instance, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) will be implemented as the SWARM Sensor; however, the
communication and powering protocols will enable the SWARM Host to receive digital or analog signals from a
wide variety of sensors in the future so that the module can be used for many applications. The following Aims
will facilitate translation to human users: Aim 1: Develop SWARM Host circuitry for communication with
outlying sensors and integrate into a full module. Aim 2: Design and fabricate a SWARM IMU Sensor as a
proof-of-concept. Aim 3: Complete bench-top testing for a full SWARM System to generate data for an early
feasibility study IDE submission.
 This project will generate the SWARM System consisting of the Host and sensor. The documentation
will create a pathway for other teams to develop sensors to integrate with the SWARM System. The open-
source material will enable the COSMIIC community to implement new sensors that amplify potential clinical
needs that could be met with the NNP system and then become products to improve quality of life for people."

COSMIIC modules, recharging the implanted power supply, programming the implanted
COSMIIC system, as well as integrating the implanted system with external sensors and surface

interventions and enable the broader community to rapidly develop closed-loop neurostimulation
interventions based on physiological signals. The first objective is to develop a Wireless Link
that will connect PCs, mobile devices, and sensors to the implanted system. This wireless link
will facilitate wired or wireless communication between the COSMIIC implanted modules and
computers used to program the modules. It will be compatible with common wired and wireless
sensor communication protocols. Using the Wireless Link will facilitate closed-loop stimulation in
response to physiological signals or smartphone app interactions. The second objective is to
develop a Surface Stimulation module that is battery-powered and delivers four channels of
stimulation. Skin surface electrical stimulation is low-risk and convenient for prototyping new
stimulation functions. The third objective is to develop a benchtop circuit board Evaluation Kit for
the implanted COSMIIC modules. This kit will facilitate custom COSMIIC module development
by allowing the custom circuit boards to function prior to development of costly titanium
enclosures or implant-grade leads. Circuit board frames will be developed that supply network,
power, and provide access to useful debugging connections. The fourth objective is to develop
a rapid inductive battery charger for the implanted COSMIIC system. The charger will optimize
charging time by adjusting active cooling and current flow based on battery status."
10918121,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid (AP) deposition,
neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and gliosis. AD is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and
more than 6.2 million Americans suffer from this disease. This year the estimated cost of AD and other dementias
is projected to reach $355 billion and can rise to $1 .1 trillion by 2050. The cause of AD remains elusive, and it is
likely multifactorial. The greatest risk factors are known to be age, genetics, and inheritance. Despite
monumental efforts and vast funding for research, only one therapy has been approved since 2003 and no
medication can prevent acquisition of the disease or halt progression. In the last decade more than 200 research
projects have not been completed or have failed. More than 15 clinical trials have attempted to promote AP
clearance but only one has received controversial approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Most of
these studies have treated patients with mild-moderate symptomatic AD, phases by which irreversible damage
have already occurred. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that intervention preceding permanent pathological
changes could provide better outcomes. However, it is estimated that pathological changes start 15-20 years
before the onset of clinical symptoms. Given the extraordinary cost of antibody-based AP, and prolonged
treatment periods both primary prevention and tertiary prevention become cost-prohibitive and unsustainable.
To develop novel and cost-effective approaches, we have developed phagocytic chimeric antigen receptors
(CARs) that can promote stable AP clearance with minimal treatment frequency. Our initial CAR designs promote
remarkable induction of potent phagocytosis of oligomeric AP in human microglial cell lines. Using this
technology, we propose to design CAR-based cellular therapies to stably promote clearance of AP plaques and
prevent further AP deposition. The approach described in this proposal has the potential to be transformative in
the treatment of AD and can likely be developed into successful treatments of other protein aggregation diseases
of the central nervous system."
10918129,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rare monogenic immune disorders have illuminated key aspects of inflammation, but many of the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. For example, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a
disorder in which T cells fail to undergo apoptosis, is most often caused by genetic defects in the death receptor
FAS or its ligand FASL. However, mutations in caspase-8 or its adaptor FADD – which mediate cell death
downstream of FAS – cause a combination of ALPS plus severe immunodeficiency. Since immunodeficiency is
not generally observed in patients with FAS or FASL mutations, I hypothesized that FADD-caspase-8 must have
an apoptosis-independent function downstream of an immune receptor other than FAS. Indeed, I recently
discovered that activation of multiple immune receptors elicits the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Nedd4-
binding protein 1 (N4BP1), a novel cytokine suppressor. This represents a critical point of regulation during
inflammation. Notably, deletion of N4BP1 does not ordinarily affect the TRIF-dependent subset of toll-like
receptors (TLRs) that activate caspase-8 (e.g., TLR3 and TLR4). However, the impaired cytokine production of
caspase-8-deficient macrophages stimulated with a TLR4 agonist is restored to normal by co-deletion of N4BP1.
In contrast, N4BP1 deletion leads to exorbitant cytokine responses by the TRIF-independent TLRs (e.g., TLR1/2,
TLR7 and TLR9) that do not directly activate caspase-8. Thus, N4BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 inactivates the
anti-inflammatory activity of intact, un-cleaved N4BP1. These findings offer a novel mechanistic explanation for
immunodeficiency caused by FADD-caspase-8 mutations, whereby the inability to cleave N4BP1 results in its
aberrant persistence and constriction of cytokine responses. Like TLR3 and TLR4 agonists, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) also leads to caspase-8 cleavage of N4BP1, endowing TNF with the ability to inactivate N4BP1 and
thereby license cytokine production by the TRIF-independent TLRs. This latter finding highlights a key point of
molecular crosstalk between the TNF and TLR systems that converges on caspase-8 cleavage of N4BP1. In the
current proposal, I have linked the mechanism by which N4BP1 suppresses cytokine production to a series of
proteins with both previously recognized and heretofore unknown roles in inflammation. In Aim 1, I will attempt
to decipher the mechanism by which N4BP1 controls the activity of this novel kinase-dependent pathway that
suppresses inflammation. In Aim 2, I will dissect how N4BP1 suppresses late phase inflammatory gene
expression using genome-scale technologies. In Aim 3, I will explore the mechanisms and in vivo consequences
of signal integration by the TNF-caspase-8-N4BP1 axis. Together, these aims will provide novel mechanistic
insights explaining a key regulatory circuit underlying inflammation. They also will serve to launch my
independent research career."

among the Projects and Cores of the Prospective Genetic Risk Evaluation and Assessment (PROGRESS) in
Autism Center. The Admin Core’s goal is to foster a PROGRESS Center environment that allows for the
complementary and synergistic execution of the proposed multidisciplinary research that will identify and partner
with a cohort of families whose children are at identified genetic risk (IGR) for autism (Project 1), understand the
impact of this genetic information on parents and families (Project 2), and examine neurobehavioral trajectories
of PROGRESS Cohort children across development (Project 3). In addition to supporting these three Projects,
the Admin Core will support the other Core Components: the Assessment Core, the Statistical and
Computational Analysis (SCA) Core, and the Dissemination and Outreach (D&O) Core. The Admin Core will
have three main functions. The first function is scientific leadership and integration, providing programmatic
governance to maximize synergy, efficiency and impact of our research. The Admin Core leadership is
composed of the Executive Committee (Center Director and Co-Director, Director of Operations, Director of
Finance, and a Program Coordinator) and a Steering Committee (all Project and Core Leads and Co-Leads).
Admin Core function includes programmatic coordination of the Center Research Projects and Cores, strategic
planning of short- and long-term goals, and ethical considerations of the implications of our genomic research.
Secondly, the Admin Core will provide management to deliver centralized administrative, fiscal,
organizational, and communications coordination of the PROGRESS Center. The Projects and Cores span
Columbia University, the New York State Psychiatric Institute, and Weill Cornell Medical Center, thus requiring
central governance and organization that will be provided by inter-institutional coordination and communication
by the Admin Core. Finally, the Admin Core will ensure added value and scientific rigor of the PROGRESS
Center Research Projects and Cores through Center Evaluation. The Admin Core will interface with an
External Advisory Committee (EAC) of experts in fields relevant to autism research. The Admin Core will respond
to recommendations made by the EAC, as well as recommendations made by a Community Advisory Board
(CAB) to address scientific and community concerns and increase the PROGRESS Center’s national and global
influence on scientific and clinical practice. The Admin Core will therefore provide seamless integration of the
various PROGRESS Center Components at multiple sites to produce high quality and meaningful data that will
aid in early identification and management of identified genetic risk for developing autism."

More than 80% of the 3 million women who labor and deliver each year in the United States undergo
continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor. The goal of such monitoring is to identify fetal
hypoxia and prevent the transition to acidemia, expedited operative delivery, and/or neonatal morbidity.
Category II EFM, the most commonly observed group of fetal heart rate features, is associated with variable
risks for acidemia. One common response to Category II EFM is maternal oxygen (O2) supplementation. The
theoretic rationale for O2 administration is that it increases O2 transfer to a hypoxic fetus, thereby reversing
hypoxia and preventing acidemia. This practice is so commonly used that 2 out of 3 patients receive
supplemental O2 at some point during labor. However, despite the theoretic rationale, there is no rigorous data
to support its widespread use. Our pilot randomized noninferiority trial, published in JAMA Pediatrics,
demonstrated that room air was noninferior to O2 for improving umbilical artery lactate, a surrogate marker of
fetal acidemia and neonatal morbidity. Our subsequent meta-analysis of randomized trials investigating O2
versus room air at time of cesarean section or vaginal delivery found no differences in umbilical artery pH,
rates of acidemia, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions between room air and O2 groups. Importantly,
none of the trials studied important clinical measures of neonatal or maternal morbidity and only one trial
studied O2 in the setting of Category II EFM. The current state of evidence is limited in several ways. First, the
existing studies of O2 in labor vary in the dose, duration, and timing of O2 administration. Second, only one
pilot trial investigated the utility of O2 supplementation for the ACOG-recommended indication of Category II
EFM. Third, all of the studies have used surrogate measures of neonatal morbidity such as cord gases or
neonatal intensive care unit admission. Finally, none of the studies were powered to assess the impact of O2
administration on neonatal clinical sequelae of in utero hypoxia or operative delivery. Without data on these
definitive outcomes, evidence-based recommendations for managing Category II EFM cannot be made.
To fill this important knowledge gap, we propose a large, multicenter, randomized noninferiority trial of O2
supplementation versus room air in patients with Category II EFM in labor. Our central hypothesis is that
clinically relevant maternal and neonatal outcomes will not significantly differ between the two arms. We
will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of room air, compared with supplemental O2,
on neonatal morbidity among patients with Category II EFM and 2) Determine the effect of room air,
compared with supplemental O2, on rates of operative delivery. A total of 2124 patients will be randomized
to provide adequate power to detect clinically meaningful noninferiority margins for the above stated
outcomes."

Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. It causes
difficult-to-treat infections and jeopardizes modern healthcare advancements. As the emergence of bacterial
resistance is outpacing the development of new antibiotics, we must find cost-effective, innovative approaches
to discover new antibacterial therapeutics complementary to small-molecule antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs), as a new class of antibacterial agents, represent one of the most promising solutions to fill this void,
since they generally undergo faster development, display rapid onsets of killing, and most importantly show lower
risks of induced resistance, compared to small-molecule antibiotics. Yet, very few analogs or modified derivatives
of natural AMPs have been approved in practice, and most of the failure is caused by systemic or local toxicity
associated with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Toward a long-term goal to discover effective, selective
AMPs as therapeutics to target a narrow spectrum of specific antibiotic-resistant pathogens, our objective is to
develop the new capacity needed for such discovery, by integrating innovative approaches and applications of
machine learning, multiscale modeling, peptide synthesis, and microbiology. We have developed the first
generative adversarial network model (AMP-GAN) to produce AMP candidates with diverse sequences and
structures, as well as accurate multiscale models and methods to study the mechanisms of AMP aggregation
and target interactions. It is our central hypothesis that AMP selectivity may be achieved via controlling their
sequence, structure, interaction, aggregation, and co-aggregation. In pursuit of three specific aims to establish
a novel methodology toward discovery of narrow-spectrum AMPs, we will (i) generate selective AMP sequences
with predictable activity and pathogen targets, (ii) identify AMPs to target characteristic biomolecules in
pathogens, and (iii) modulate AMP aggregation to tune cell selectivity or to achieve synergy. We will advance
our computational techniques like AMP-GAN and top-down simulations in conjugation with chemical
characterizations (for structure and dynamics) and cellular assays (for activity and toxicity). We anticipate gaining
a fundamental understanding of how to design narrow-spectrum AMPs, as well as how to combine new
computational and experimental tools to achieve desired AMP selectivity. Overall, this contribution can be
significant since it will establish new avenues for precision AMP design and bring more AMPs closer to the clinic
by overcoming their known pitfalls. The resulting knowledge will be widely shared in the scientific community for
AMP research and development. Our concepts and approaches are innovative, as they shift the current
paradigm of broad-spectrum AMP design towards higher accuracy, diversity, and target selectivity through
precision AMP design. Collectively, given the increasing need for treatment options against antibiotic-resistant
infections, the methodology and tools from this proposed research will enable the discovery of new therapeutics
for challenging infectious diseases."
10914882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with a 5-year survival rate less than
20%. Incidence of EAC has risen sharply in the U.S. and other Western countries over the past four decades,
largely due to rising prevalence of two risk factors – gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity. EAC
develops from Barrett’s esophagus (BE), a cancer precursor defined by a specialized columnar metaplasia of
the distal esophagus. Although BE follows an indolent course in most patients, 5-10% eventually progress to
cancer, and a sizable fraction of BE remain undetected in the population. A critical unmet need is to identify
individuals with high-risk BE who are most likely to develop EAC and thus benefit from screening and
endoscopic surveillance. Conversely, identifying the majority who are unlikely to progress will reduce risks and
costs associated with unnecessarily frequent surveillance. Biomarker-assisted risk stratification, however,
continues to be hindered by our limited understanding of the molecular pathways underlying early steps in the
development of EAC. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~20 novel
genetic susceptibility loci, yet most heritability remains unexplained, and only one SNP is linked specifically to
BE→EAC progression. The epigenome, an important interface between the environment and the genome, has
not been studied for its potential mediating roles in relation to genotypes, strong environmental risk factors and
progression to EAC. To address these gaps, overcome sample size limitations for a rare cancer, and invigorate
existing research efforts, newer molecular and statistical approaches are needed to systematically integrate
multi-omics data with established disease exposures. In this project we will conduct the most comprehensive
multi-omics study of BE, the key cancer precursor, profiling the transcriptome and methylome of 500 biopsies
from the NCI-funded Barrett’s and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium and Roswell Park Comprehensive
Cancer Center, and perform integrative analyses leveraging genotypes and environmental risk factors already
available through the largest GWAS meta-analysis for BE/EAC (n≈27,000). The goal is to identify new genetic
risk loci through eQTL mapping and transcriptome-wide association study (Aim 1), new epigenetic loci
mediating and predicting the risk of BE progression to EAC (Aim 2), and develop risk prediction models
integrating genome-wide polygenic risk score and environmental exposures (Aim 3). The unifying theme of the
three aims is development and implementation of innovative analytical strategies, leveraging transcriptome and
methylome data. Ultimately, genetics, epigenetics, and environmental exposures will be incorporated to identify
high-risk populations for tailored screening and surveillance, and prevent cancer development."

The candidate requests support for a five-year program of training and research to better understand how
electronic health record phenotyping and other computational methods applied to existing medical record data
can bolster detection and prediction of suicide attempts by children ages 10 to 17. In the proposed training
plan, the candidate will build upon her previous experiences in social psychology, clinical informatics, and
clinical child and adolescent psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at the University of California, Los
Angeles Health System. Her training plan includes developing skills and knowledge in 1) analysis of natural
language (text) data, 2) development of risk algorithms in healthcare settings to improve suicide prevention, 3)
basic qualitative research skills including modified Delphi Panel approach, and 4) the responsible conduct of
research. Suicide is the second leading cause of death of young people over 10 years old in the United States
and suicide attempts among children are common, costly and preventable. There is an urgent need to close
the gap between risk prediction algorithms and clinically-useable tools that can enhance medical decision-
making for providers and families. This study proposes that electronic health record phenotyping, a method of
standardizing case detection using clinical note text and structured medical record data, may offer improved
detection and personalized risk prediction for children, thus complementing existing suicide prevention efforts.
In the proposed research, using a cross-sectional design, Aim 1 will focus on adaptation of electronic health
record phenotyping to detect emergency department visits for suicide attempts by children using electronic
health records. Then, using a case-control design, Aim 2 will focus on development of risk prediction models of
emergency department visits for suicide attempts by children using longitudinal electronic health records over
two years. Aim 3 will focus on assessment of the validity, acceptability, usability, feasibility, and overall utility of
a personalized risk prediction prototype with case simulations using a modified Delphi panel approach. This
plan will parallel a training plan building skills and knowledge to bridge informatics, computational methods,
and clinical child psychiatry. In the long term, this research is an initial step to enhance signal detection and
support prediction of suicide attempts, in turn, setting the stage for deployment of personalized approaches to
prevention in clinical settings where providers, youth, and families may directly benefit."
10915032,"A key aspect of survival is an organism’ ability to adapt their behavior based on experience. At the cellular
level, a well-established view of how experience can stably change behavior is that new mRNA and protein
synthesis occurs, and that this new state becomes stably encoded in the chromatin, the complex of DNA and
proteins that determines transcriptional state. Sleep is an extremely conserved drive found across the animal
kingdom that may facilitate these processes. We hypothesize that one of the evolutionary conserved functions
of sleep is to influence gene expression and chromatin regulation. There are multiple lines of evidence that
support the idea that sleep is important for transcriptional regulation and chromatin stability, but to date no one
has directly compared transcriptional responses to sleep loss across vertebrate species or between brain and
other tissues within the same species. This is important because to determine conserved mechanisms it is
necessary to compare across evolutionary time.
Another key limitation of all omics studies of sleep is the lack of resolution at the single-cell level. This is
important because, as show in our preliminary studies, different cell types respond differently to sleep loss. In
addition, the lack of resolution at the single cell-level can make mapping correspondence between changes in
gene expression and changes in chromatin inaccurate. The application of single-cell transcriptomic and
epigenomic analysis is a promising avenue to understand transcriptional regulation. However, single-cell
approaches have not yet been applied to understand how sleep influences transcription and chromatin
regulation. In this Maximizing Investigators Research Award (MIRA) we will utilize state of the art single-cell
genomic technology to define, for the first time, common sleep-dependent transcriptional and epigenetic
programs across different cell-types between two distantly related vertebrate species: Mouse and Zebrafish.
This proposal leverages expertise in comparative genomics and evolution, computational biology and the
application of transcriptomic and epigenomic technology to study brain and behavior, training I have acquired
throughout my PhD and post-doctoral fellowship. The goal is to establish a program of research focused on
understanding how sleep across different species can alter transcription and chromatin accessibility in different
cell-types. In the short-term this proposal will produce a comprehensive cell atlas of sleep-dependent
regulation of gene expression and chromatin states, as well as publicly available software for single-cell data
analysis. In the long-term these studies will serve as the basis for functional studies to define evolutionary
conserved mechanisms by which sleep can modulate gene expression and chromatin architecture."

In 2006, the National Cancer Institute began supporting transdisciplinary training in behavioral oncology at
Indiana University, initially with an R25T mechanism which transitioned to a T32 in 2016. In response to PA-
20-142, we seek to continue this T32 training program. During the last 10 years, 83% of completed predoctoral
trainees (10 of 12) accepted postdoctoral fellowships at prestigious research institutions, five trainees
completed F31 applications of which 60% were funded, and the average number of publications per trainee
was 9.4. Of the 13 predoctoral trainees, 23% were from racial minority populations. Ten postdoctoral trainees
have completed their training and 78% accepted tenure-track academic positions; an additional trainee
accepted a prestigious research position at the FDA focused on tobacco research. Two postdoctoral trainees
have submitted K99/R00 applications of which one was funded and the second received a score of 40. The
trainee who received this score accepted a tenure-track position and will submit a K23 based on the K99/R00.
A total of 33% of postdoctoral trainees have been from racial minority populations. The average number of
publications per postdoctoral trainee was 9.5.
This T32 program resides in a strong, research-intensive environment, which includes the Indiana University
Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center (IUSCCC), a health science campus, and over 100 research institutes,
laboratories, and specialized programs available to trainees. The program is led by a stellar and dedicated
team of transdisciplinary mentors. The IUSCCC and other schools involved in this training program have
committed over $1,100,000 for the next five years in support of this training program.
The political, social, and economic turmoil evidenced in events of the last year underscore the many disparities
that exist in our country, which directly impact significant inequities in cancer outcomes. We believe that the
disparate cancer burden faced by our underserved populations can best be addressed by training fellows that
reflect the diversity of our state and nation while prioritizing approaches to reducing disparities in cancer
prevention and control research. Therefore, our aims are to: 1) recruit well-qualified applicants including those
from diverse disciplines and underrepresented backgrounds; 2) provide a rigorous training program across the
continuum of cancer prevention and control science with established and committed research mentors and an
integrated focus on cancer equity; and 3) Prepare trainees with the knowledge, skills, and opportunities that
support independent peer-reviewed research leading to reduced cancer morbidity and mortality across all
populations. We retain successful strategies from the current training program while adding innovative
opportunities that reflect our changing society. A strong mentoring team and training platform support the
acquisition of defined outcome competencies. This competing continuation is co-led by Drs. Victoria Champion
and Catherine Mosher, whose disciplinary backgrounds and research foci provide complementary skills."
10915035,"Project Summary
 Currently our understanding of how the nervous system maintains ocular surface homeostasis is extremely
limited. New technologies, methods and models are needed to advance our scientific understanding and address
knowledge gaps. The ocular surface and tear film-secreting glands (including the lacrimal and meibomian glands,
as well as the goblet cells) are carefully controlled to provide an optically smooth, low-scattering surface with
appropriate immune and injury responses. Sensory feedback to maintain the structural and functional integrity
of the ocular surface is provided by the corneal nerves, which send feedback from stimuli (chemical, thermal,
mechanical) to ganglia (e.g., trigeminal) and brain regions (e.g., ventral posteromedial thalamus) to drive
production of tear film components as well as the blink reflex. This delicate balance of neural control is disrupted
by damage, peripheral neuropathies, inflammation and further complicated by a wide array of immune responses
to various diseases. Dysfunction of this feedback loop can lead to a downward spiral of further dysregulation.
Aberrant neural control of the ocular surface can lead to abnormal sensation and pain, which in the worst cases
can be disabling. To find remedies, it is first essential to understand the underlying neural control system and
how it adapts to its environment.
 In this proposal, we aim to bring new tools and models to study molecular, cellular, and functional interactions
across systems responsible for neural control of the ocular surface and examine how they change under different
inflammatory and pain conditions. We have assembled an excellent team with expertise across multiple fields
including advanced 3D microscopy, neuroscience, electrophysiology, pain, ocular immunology, ocular lipid
metabolism, ocular surface disorders, spatial statistics, and machine/deep learning. Here, we will utilize cutting
edge techniques and technologies including optical clearing, tract tracing, ethologically-valid behavior analysis,
machine/deep learning, spatial statistics, genetically encoded calcium imaging, light-sheet microscopy,
multiplexed 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging, and multi-array electrodes implanted in the
brain. These tools will help us assess molecular, cellular, and functional interactions across organs and begin to
understand ocular surface control at the organism level. We will also employ several relevant animal models to
assess ocular surface control under different inflammatory and pain conditions. Models include AWAT2 deficient
mice that mimic evaporative dry eye disease (DED), diabetic mice, an epithelial debridement model with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa that mimics bacterial keratitis, and human donor eyes. The mouse models all have
gCaMP6f expressed in corneal nerves allowing functional imaging of calcium transients. With these models we
will study both innate and adaptive immunity as well as nociceptive and neuropathic pain responses. In addition,
we will apply nerve growth factor (NGF) to our models to study how a potential treatment option alters the ocular
surface control system."

three investigators: a Peru-based investigator, Dr. Robinson Cabello, MPI, and two Seattle-based
investigators, Dr. Duerr (MPI and Co-Chair Trial 1) and Dr. Madeleine (Contact MPI, Co-Investigator Trials 2
and 3). Together they will provide scientific direction, enhance productivity, liaise with the NCI, and monitor
safety, quality, recruitment, and progress toward each of the Aims of the Clinical Trials and service Cores. The
Aims of the ACC are as follows: Aim 1 of the ACC is to organize the C2P2 Center by distributing responsibility
and accountability throughout the C2P2 Center. The ACC will implement the Triple C (Communication,
Cooperation and Coordination) model of project management. This organizational approach will be grounded
in meeting regional needs and in respect for working with LAC partners who will lead and sustain the cuttingedge changes we develop together through integrated and interdisciplinary team science. Aim 2 is to facilitate
communication and scheduling at all levels of the partnership. The ACC will foster high-level and bidirectional coordination and cooperation directly with unit leaders (Clinical Trial Co-Chairs and service Core
Leaders) across the C2P2 Center (i.e., Core teams, Clinical Trial teams, institutions), and with external
advisors (i.e., External Scientific Advisory Group and the cross-cutting Partnership Center Coordinating
Committee). Aim 3 of the ACC is to lead all trial monitoring and regulatory coordination activities with the
assistance of the Data Coordinating Core. The first priority of the ACC is patient safety at both trial sties. Aim 4
of the ACC will provide training and dissemination of findings. The ACC will administratively support the
Clinical Trial Co-Chairs through cross-institutional training as needed to refine laboratory assay quality control,
data management skills training, and streamlined organizational infrastructure building that will enhance the
success of the matrixed partnership. All trial findings will be disseminated through published papers and
presentations in the region and at international meetings of policy and guideline makers who will be able to use
our trial findings to accelerate progress toward elimination of cervical cancer through prevention. The ACC will
provide leadership to accomplish the overall scientific goal of the C2P2 Center to improve the quality and

The WUPCEN Administrative Core will play an important role in the infrastructure of this P50 WUPCEN,
directly contributing to its management and accomplishments and ensuring that the overall missions are met.
This is particularly important as it allows close interaction, data sharing, and planning between the project
leaders/labs/educational activities with one another as well aiding transmittal of data from the Biomedical
Cores. The Administrative Core will serve as the primary managerial component for all activities of the
Research Center. It will be responsible for the management of resources within the Research Center and
outreach to the wider pediatric nephrology research community. The goals of this Administrative Core are to
develop and maintain the relevant goals of the Research Center; coordinate, manage and integrate the
Research Center’s components and activities, which includes coordinating ongoing research between the
Research Project(s) and the Biomedical Core(s). The Administrative Core will work collaboratively and
productively with the other PCENs on joint efforts including the annual scientific meeting and a collaborative
approach to optimize the use of Opportunity Pool funds for Pilot and Feasibility awards through the Opportunity
Pool and the use of JIT awards from the WUPCEN Biomedical Core. Our Educational Enrichment program is
designed to attract and engage individuals at all levels towards pediatric kidney disease research. The
Educational Enrichment Program has three main goals: Promote early career engagement, train investigators
in new techniques and foster innovative collaborations. We have three main instruments for early career
engagement: Summer research experiences, student recruitment programs, and a seminar series. The
Educational Enrichment Program will be directed/governed by Dr. Jain and Dr. Dharnidharka together.
To sustain the field of pediatric nephrology research, it is essential to have seed funding for potentially high

Pediatric Kidney BioMedical Core (pKidBIO Core)
Kidney disease is a major cause of illness and death in infants, children, and adolescents with the
incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in these patients in the United States of about 15
per million. The rapidly increasing problems of adult hypertension and renal failure may also have
roots in pediatric kidney insults that go undetected, unprevented and untreated. The development
of effective interventions and methods of early detection and severity measurements of renal
disease in children is lagging in part due to a lack of knowledge of physiological and pathological
changes that occur as the kidney matures. Molecular blueprints would dramatically enhance our
ability to design effective approaches to intervene and prevent kidney dysfunction. This goal
cannot be met, however, without having a source of pediatric kidney tissue to begin molecular
interrogations to identify the, uniquely human and developmental, ’omic instructions required to
make and maintain healthy kidneys. The pKidBIO core, as part of the Washington University
Pediatric Center of Excellence, is in an unusually strong and unique position to provide the
required pediatric kidney tissues, originating from clinical biopsies or as “gifts of life” consented for
research, preserved with methods shown to be compatible with the most recent technologies to
enable age-specific research to dig into multi-omic single cell transcriptome and epigenome
assays, molecular imaging and tissue engineering. By its design and nature, the pKidBIO core will
promote enthusiasm and progress in pediatric kidney disease research by 1) providing human
age-specific references for fetal and childhood kidney disease tissues, 2) enabling studies aimed
to delineate cellular, morphological, physiological and molecular changes associated with postnatal
kidney maturation, 3) accelerating scientific research aimed at ex vivo human kidney organoids, 4)
establishing protocols for isolating differentiated kidney cell types at stages consistent with those
seen in kidney tissue samples, 5) advancing drug toxicity screening, and by 6) designing validation
studies of gene function and kidney engineering. The availability of the tissue and the outstanding
data generated from them will attract new expertise outside kidney research developing spatial
imaging and analytical technologies and research interested in physiological aging across the
lifespan. The pKidBIO repository will be a national resource for the research and clinical
community that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable."
10915731,"Abstract/Project Summary
Kidney disease is common and deadly with frequent onset in childhood. Kidney and urinary tract congenital
anomalies account for the majority of renal failure in children. Glomerular diseases and acute kidney injury
(AKI) occur in up to 60% of neonatal and pediatric intensive care patients, directly correlating with length of
stay, subsequent disability, and mortality. Kidney insults in childhood including ischemia, hyperoxia, infection
and nephrotoxic drug/environmental exposures impair glomerular, tubular and bladder physiologic maturation
and function resulting in overt chronic renal disease (CKD), and with stealthier hypertension and proteinuria.
Although molecular interrogation of fetal and adult kidney is advanced, data on the postnatal developing and
injured pediatric kidney and urinary tract are lagging due to lack of pediatric samples of healthy / reference
kidneys and a network for investigation. This dataset is critical to understand postnatal kidney disease in all
living children and to augment investigation of various consortia interrogating molecular signatures from
children with CKD. This pediatric kidney atlas project (pKidCAP) is a unique opportunity to unite a
collaborative set of investigators together with a biomedical core (pKidBIO) with a proven source of donor
pediatric organs to build an atlas across age, race and sex. The pKidCAP will apply snRNAseq/ATACseq for
defining cell specific gene expression and cis-regulatory elements from the same cell. Cell type and state
diversity will be mapped across the pediatric life cycle on tissue using near single cell spatial transcriptomics.
These maps will be generated on healthy and a subset of pediatric kidney disease biopsies that can inform
disease model studies in Project 2 and other consortia investigating similar diseases. Whole genome
sequencing in all of the samples will provide a link of expression data associated with discrete regions on the
active DNA site in single cells to resolve corresponding SNPs or deleterious variants to their cell identities.
The pKidCAP atlas will serve as a benchmark for the research community interested in rebuilding kidneys,
elucidating mechanisms of kidney maturation and homeostasis, and mapping GWAS traits to active states to
support causality. Studies using animal models and organoids from iPS cells will use this dataset as a key
reference to prioritize research for drug design relevant to pediatric kidney disease. The unique data and maps
will attract expertise outside traditional kidney researchers, including computational biologists and
informaticists to design better analytical tools and new methods of data mining for new discoveries by
combining multimodal datasets across time points from pediatric to adult ages. Researchers in machine
learning, ageing research and tissue engineering will be drawn to solve fundamental aspects of cellular
differentiation in relation to disease, ageing and tissue engineering that could be broadly applicable to other
organ systems. This project will also be a unique opportunity to attract students and trainees who are
embarking on single cell multiomics projects, thereby increasing the future cohort of researchers in this field."
10915733,"Summary
 After birth, the kidney continues to develop for weeks in mice, and for months to years in humans. During
this period, the post-natal kidney is undergoing growth and maturation, which requires dynamic changes in
gene expression, metabolism, and physiological functions, and is susceptible to insults causing permanent
morphological changes and functional adaptation. Post-natal growth and maturation of the kidney play an
important role in developmentally programmed diseases. For e.g., children born with a moderate reduction in
nephron number may be more sensitive to metabolic stresses, such as high fat or high salt diet, obesity, and
renal injury from hypoxia or nephrotoxins. Many studies have generated single cell datasets for fetal and adult
mouse kidney. However, in spite of the important role of post-natal insults in development and progression of
CKD, post-natal maturation of the kidney has not been comprehensively investigated at the molecular level
using state-of-the-art technologies. The lack of a reference atlas for this critical developmental period limits our
ability to investigate alterations in cell states and diversity in models of pediatric kidney disease.
 Glomerular diseases, including nephrotic syndrome, represent an important cause of childhood kidney
disease. Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a diagnosis that is increasing in frequency, is
often recurrent and treatment resistant, and leads to end stage kidney disease. Secondary glomerulosclerosis
and albuminuria develop in common non-glomerular diseases affecting children, such as CAKUT, and portend
a higher risk of progression to end stage kidney failure. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options to treat
these disorders and a pressing need to better understand disease mechanisms. One of the major mechanisms
by which cells respond to stress or injury is by utilizing the chromatin modifying machinery to reprogram gene
regulatory networks. We developed a novel mouse model of FSGS due to loss of function of metastases
associated protein 2 (Mta2), a core component of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex. These mutant
mice represent an excellent model to investigate how clinically silent defects in nephron endowment and
altered cell differentiation can manifest as FSGS in late adolescence/early adulthood.
 In this proposal we will generate an integrated single cell and spatial transcriptomics mouse atlas
(pKidCAP) at post-natal timepoints that coincide with major physiological and developmental changes in the
kidney. We will determine the evolution of cell diversity, spatial localization, single cell gene expression
signatures and chromatin accessibility states in the developing post-natal kidney in healthy and FSGS tissue.
We will apply ChIP-seq and epigenomic editing to test the hypothesis that de-repression of Jun/AP-1 targets in
Mta2 mutants promotes inflammation, cell senescence and lipotoxicity. Integration of these datasets with the
human pKidCAP atlas (Project 1) will create a unique reference panel to identify pathways uncovered in mouse
models that are highly relevant to kidney diseases in children."
10914051,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions confined to the
mammary ducts. Reactive stroma emerges during early breast cancer development and co-evolves with breast
cancer progression. While genetic alterations during breast carcinogenesis have been extensively studied,
more in-depth investigation is needed into the non-genetic microenvironmental factors that select for these
genotypes. We hypothesize that emergence of reactive stroma precedes initiation of microinvasion, and that
this process is an effect of a modified tissue metabolic landscape. This hypothesis will be tested using the
interdisciplinary approach by explicitly integrating experimental and computational models that together are
able to handle this problem complexity. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators to
quantify tumor cell-stroma interactions under different metabolic conditions (aim 1); assess the role of
reactive stroma in DCIS upgrading (aim 2); and evaluate reactive stroma signatures in DCIS histology (aim
3). We will pursue these aims by using a comprehensive approach that combines studies of DCIS histology
samples, three-dimensional (3D) tumor organoid cultures, mathematical modeling of complex tumor
microenvironment, and quantitative algorithms applied to medical imaging. Our goal is to define novel
molecular and physical signatures of reactive stoma with a goal to improve preventive and therapeutic
strategies."

Cardiac arrest is a common and devastating emergency of the heart and the brain. More than 380,000
patients suffer out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year in the US. Improvements in cardiac
resuscitation (the early links in the “chain of survival” for patients with OHCA) are tempered by our limited
ability to resuscitate and protect the brain from global cerebral ischemia. Neurological death and disability are
common outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. Therapeutic cooling of comatose patients resuscitated from
shockable rhythms may markedly increase the rate of good neurological outcome, but poor outcomes still
occur in as many as 50%, and the benefit of cooling in those resuscitated from asystole and pulseless
electrical activity has not been evaluated in a randomized study. Even in patients with shockable rhythms,
prior trials showing efficacy have been questioned. Therapeutic cooling is already a guideline-recommended
and commonly used treatment in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, but because of limited data, the optimal
duration and patient selection criteria remain unknown and cooling devices are not FDA approved for this
indication. Preclinical data and mechanistic studies strongly suggest that durations of hypothermia longer than
those typically used may minimize brain injury. This study will determine if identifying an optimal duration of
therapeutic hypothermia can improve outcomes, and if development of a duration response curve can
substantiate efficacy in a wider patient population of cardiac arrest survivors. We hypothesize that longer
durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or
may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having good outcome. The
overarching goal of this project is to identify clinical strategies that will increase the number of patients with
good neurological recovery from cardiac arrest. The results of this trial will be immediately significant,
impacting both clinical practice and regulatory evaluation. The trial uses innovative adaptive dose finding
methods that allow exploration of a wide range of potential durations and efficiently allocate subjects where
they will be most informative. The study methods also include innovative approaches to traditional outcome
assessment and innovative outcome assessment tools, including the NIH Toolbox. The study will be
conducted in the NIH SIREN Emergency Clinical Trials infrastructure. SIREN leverages existing resources to
achieve economies of scale, maintain talented rapidly responding teams to screen and enroll subjects in the
emergency department setting, and to continue clinical investigations through the ICU stay and beyond with
proven performance."
10914762,"Advancements in computational psychiatry allow us to isolate multiple, specific cognitive mechanisms that
determine human behavior. This formal modeling framework generates quantitative parameter estimates that
can serve as bridges between pathophysiology and psychopathology. A major goal of computational psychiatry
is to translate these laboratory tools so that they can be used in the clinic. Two critical hurdles need to be
overcome. First, the enhanced validity and sensitivity of computational metrics needs to be established relative
to standard behavioral performance metrics in key psychiatric and nonpsychiatric populations. We propose to
do that by addressing a range of cognitive and motivational domains that have been strongly implicated in
psychopathology, including working and episodic memory, visual perception, reinforcement learning, and effort
based decision making. Second, we need to establish and optimize the psychometrics of these computational
metrics so that they can be used as tools in treatment development, treatment evaluation, longitudinal, and
genetic studies. These powerful metrics must have adequate test-retest reliability, and not be limited by ceiling
and floor effects. We propose to develop these methods using an open, flexible, and scalable framework and
demonstrate that they provide valid data both in the laboratory and in large-scale Internet-based data collection,
facilitating “big data” studies of cognitive processes. To this end, the current project will leverage the expertise
of Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability and Clinical applications in Serious mental illness (CNTRACS)
consortium, a multi-site research group with an established record of rapid cognitive tool development and
dissemination. Aim 1 is to establish that model based parameters for the measurement of cognitive function are
more sensitive than standard behavioral methods in assessing deficits across a range of common mental
disorders, and have an enhanced capacity to predict clinical symptoms and real-world functioning, with a sample
of 180 patients with psychotic and affective disorders (both medicated and unmedicated) and 100 healthy
controls. Aim 2 is to measure and optimize the psychometric properties (test re-test reliability, internal validity,
floor and absence of ceiling and practice effects) of computational parameters described in Aim 1, in a new
sample of 180 psychiatric patients and 100 healthy controls. Aim 3 is to establish the feasibility and replicability
of model-based analytic approaches outside the laboratory for assessing RDoC dimensions of interest, and to
assess their relationships to variation in psychotic-like experience, depression and anhedonia, as well as real-
world functioning in a community sample of 10,000 recruited over the Internet. Aim 4 is to validate key model
based parameters against well-characterized neurophysiological measures acquired using EEG recordings
during task performance. Successful completion of these Aims will significantly advance the field by providing
easily administered and scalable web-based tools for estimating the integrity of key neural systems that underlie
normal cognition and motivation and form the basis of common forms of cognitive and affective psychopathology."
10914765,"Background/Rationale: As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic expands across the United
States and the world, there are no proven therapies and little information is known regarding on immunity to
this virus. At this stage of the pandemic, all prevention and treatment strategies that show promise must be
explored. This proposal will focus on the polyclonal and monoclonal antibody responses to the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) envelope.
Objectives: The overarching goal of this program is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the
polyclonal and monoclonal response to the SARS-CoV-2 envelope E, M, and S proteins. The specific aims of
this proposal are: 1) Deconvolute the polyclonal antibody response against the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2;
2) Isolate neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against various epitopes of spike protein (S),
envelope protein (E), and membrane glycoprotein (M) of SARS-CoV-2; and 3) Map the corresponding
epitope(s) of the monoclonal antibodies.
Methods: We will obtain paired, acute and convalescent, samples from 60 inpatients and outpatients with
COVID-19 (30 have already been enrolled from the VA Maryland Health Care System and the University of
Maryland Medical System). We will screen samples by binding, live and pseudovirus neutralization. In this
proposal, we also will have access to BSL3 facilities on this campus that run neutralization assay with live virus
by one of the world experts in coronaviruses (Matt Frieman, PhD). Donors will be ranked on the basis of both
neutralization potency and breadth, and binding. The top three donors in each of the inpatient and outpatient
groups will be chosen for further study (top anti-RBD neutralization and breath, top anti- receptor binding domain
(RBD)-depleted plasma neutralization and breath, and top spike binding titers with non-neutralizing plasma).
 In these six individuals, the anti-envelope antibody will be affinity purified; and fractionated using free-
flow-electrophoresis. This technique can separate antibodies based on charge, which will lead to separation
based on targeted epitopes as well. Individual fractions will be tested by binding and neutralization; and
characteristic biochemical and functional signatures of antibodies targeting each epitope will be ascertained.
Fractions of interest (different for each donor depending if neutralization or binding is targeted) will be sent for
mass spectrometry. B cell libraries will also be made from the convalescent IgG and IgA memory B cell pools;
and they will be interrogated using three complementary techniques including - acute phase plasmablast
repertoire analysis, subtraction analysis, and antigen baiting to identify potential antibodies.
 Finally, mass spectrometry will be used to rank antibody candidates. 40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
will be made and again be screened by neutralization potency, breadth, and isoelectric point, with top neutralizing
and binding antibodies (matching the respective profiles of the fractions that were targeted) to be moved forward
for fine epitope analysis by X-ray crystallography.
Impact: If successful, this project will yield a substantial understanding of neutralizing/non-neutralizing
antibodies and epitopes in COVID-19 disease, providing mAbs that can be moved into animal/human testing.
This research has direct relevance to the health of Veterans as any monoclonal antibodies isolated can
potentially be used for treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19."
10914769,"Project Abstract
There are currently no effective treatments for atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in part
because we may be intervening too late in the disease course after geographic atrophy (GA) has developed. A
far preferable strategy would be to intervene at an earlier phase of the disease, but there is uncertainty with
regards to disease biomarkers to select the most appropriate patients as well as endpoints which could be
used to conduct an interventional trial in a clinically-practical time-frame. This is in large part because of the
lack of a sufficiently granular staging system describing the progression from early to late stage AMD. The best
currently available data comes from studies such as the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study and the Beaver
Dam Eye Study, but these studies were largely based on color fundus photographs with AMD disease features
assessed using historical protocols developed in the film-based imaging era. The AMD disease severity scales
and staging systems built from these studies are insufficiently granular and fail to take advantage of modern,
pervasive digital imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography
(OCT-A) which readily lend themselves to quantification. Extensive research over the past decade has
identified a number of structural OCT features of AMD, such as intraretinal hyper-reflective foci and subretinal
drusenoid deposits, which appear to increase the risk for developing late AMD (atrophy and/or
neovascularization). More recently, choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits have been shown to increase with age
and in AMD. The relationship between CC flow deficits and the onset and stage of AMD still remains to be
defined. In addition, although a number of genetic risk factors for AMD have been identified, the genetics of
AMD progression are not yet elucidated. This research application proposes to address these critical
knowledge gaps by evaluating elderly subjects with AMD who have previously been recruited as part of the
NEI-funded Amish Eye Study. The Amish represent a homogenous population with regards to environmental
and social exposures which reduces variability and makes this group ideally suited for epidemiologic studies of
AMD progression. Through that previous study, baseline (and some 2-year follow up) clinical, multimodal
imaging (including OCT), and genetic data have already been collected. However, long-term (7 year) data,
which will be a focus of our proposed research, is critical to actually establish which individuals go on to
progress to late AMD, which is vital in order to determine which baseline features are associated with a higher
risk of progression, and to develop a granular and quantitative staging system for AMD. The development of
this novel AMD staging system will provide points of intervention and outcome assessment to enable
early intervention clinical trials and provide new insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of
AMD."

10915482,"The goal of this proposal is to identify whether increasing cardiac glycolysis at its rate-limiting step can
mitigate diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) and improve whole body glucose tolerance. DC is a major public health
issue that arises in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is mediated by numerous factors. Chief amongst them
is the loss of metabolic flexibility, which is the capacity of the heart to take up and metabolize available circulating
nutrients. The healthy heart primarily uses fatty acids, but it can shift to glucose metabolism in response to
feeding. However, with diabetes the heart relies almost exclusively on fatty acid oxidation and if chronic, this
leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ultimately DC. While restoring proper cardiac
metabolism has therapeutic potential, there are currently no treatments to normalize metabolic inflexibility. We
posit that increasing glycolysis can normalize metabolic inflexibility and mitigate DC. We have been testing this
hypothesis using mice that have enhanced cardiac glucose metabolism (GlycoHi mice) via the expression of a
constitutively active form of the glycolytic regulator, phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2). We found that: GlycoHi mice
are resistant to diet-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction; GlycoHi heart mitochondria have an enhanced capacity
to use pyruvate, indicative of increased metabolic flexibility; and female GlycoHi mice have improved systemic
glucose tolerance and are resistant to HFD effects. This supports our hypothesis that increasing cardiac PFK-2
activity can mitigate DC and have beneficial effects on whole body glucose regulation. Our first Aim is to test the
hypothesis that increasing cardiac glycolysis improves metabolic flexibility in response to HFD or type 1 diabetes.
Control and GlycoHi mice will be subjected to HFD or induced with type 1 diabetes. We will determine cardiac
function and metabolic profile by both proteomics and metabolomics. Metabolic flexibility will be measured in
adult cardiomyocytes using a radiolabeled assay. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that increasing cardiac glycolysis
sustains mitochondrial function under diabetic conditions. We will interrogate mitochondrial function in diabetic
(T1D and T2D) control GlycoHi, and PFK-2 knockout mice. We will also determine how the increase in glycolysis
is able to sustain pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms by which increasing
cardiac glycolysis improves whole body glucose tolerance in diabetic GlycoHi mice. We will discern between
increased energy expenditure, using metabolic cages, and increased insulin sensitivity in heart, skeletal muscle,
and adipose tissue. We will also test the hypothesis that the effects are mediated through changes in adipocyte
differentiation and bioenergetics. The occurrence of diabetes continues to increase, and heart disease and heart
failure are leading causes of death in this population. It is not known whether increasing cardiac glycolysis has
therapeutic potential in mitigating DC. These results will be an impetus for future studies that examine the
therapeutic potential of targeting PFK-2 to normalize cardiac metabolic flexibility and glucose homeostasis."

Dartmouth is home to a robust pediatric academic program centered in the Children’s Hospital at
Dartmouth (CHaD). During the first three years of ECHO funding, we have built a highly functioning
pediatric Clinical Trials Unit and integrated it with clinical trials resources within the Dartmouth
community and the ECHO IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). This has allowed
us to support and expand the pediatric clinical trials portfolio, to recruit investigators and groups to this
core, to leverage existing resources and develop new ones, to engage local as well as multi-center
clinical trials, and to foster broad professional development. Our investigative team has contributed
substantially to the development, leadership, and protocol design and implementation of the ISPCTN.
The organization of our regional presence in the form of the Dartmouth Regional Pediatric Clinical
Trials Unit (DRP-CTU) will allow recruitment of a diverse pediatric population, including those who are
rural and underserved. Going forward, we propose to build on our existing infrastructure in support of
clinical trial implementation and professional development.
To accomplish this, we propose three Specific AIMS:
1. To develop institutional clinical research capacity targeting pregnant women and children
with a special emphasis on rural and underserved populations.
2. To foster the professional development of faculty and support team members in the
conduct of translational clinical research.
3. To stimulate and support our pediatric research community in the multicenter study of
pediatric conditions and disease processes.
We also propose a topical, impactful clinical trial to evaluate Youth Vaping Cessation Strategies,
directed by thought leaders in this field.
This initiative will provide a much-needed central coordinating platform for the conduct of pediatric
clinical trials in the Dartmouth community. It will contribute to all aspects of the ISPCTN and will
support existing and new investigators - expanding our clinical trials universe, stimulating expansion
of our portfolio, and offering new opportunities for professional development with the resultant
recruitment/training of new faculty and research staff."
10915488,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to design cost-effective anabolic agents with less toxicity, and convenient
use for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Current treatments of OA have limited effects on the prevention
and progression of cartilage degeneration. Complex signaling events in cartilage underlie OA pathogenesis
and these can be targeted. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) bind
to the type I PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) to elicit both Gs/cAMP and Gq/PLC signaling pathways. Published
as well as our preliminary data demonstrate a PTH1R Gs/cAMP signaling arm that is therapeutic and a
Gq/PLC signaling arm that is pathogenic. Beta-catenin mediates canonical Wnt signaling, facilitates
chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation and plays an important role in OA development. However, the
interplay between PTH1R and beta-catenin that contributes to OA pathogenesis remains poorly understood.
Recent data from others and our group have demonstrated that beta-catenin interacts with the PTH1R and
switches PTH1R signaling from Gs/cAMP to Gq/PLC activation. Moreover, beta-catenin expression is
increased in human OA, the outcome of which promotes the PTH1R signaling switch and causes articular
cartilage loss and OA development. It has been established that systemic or intra-articular administration of
PTH or PTHrP is able to prevent cartilage degeneration and regenerate the damaged cartilage. However, daily
injection of PTH or PTHrP is inconvenient and reduces medication adherence. PTHrP is normally secreted by
chondrocytes in low levels and is increased in OA. The carboxyl-terminal region of six amino acids is the beta-
catenin binding site in PTH1R. Our preliminary studies have determined that this six-amino-acid peptide
(disruptor peptide) blocks beta-catenin binding to PTH1R. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the
disruptor peptide biases endogenous PTHrP-induced PTH1R signaling to favor the therapeutic signaling arm
and improve the ability of PTHrP to inhibit cartilage degeneration and treat/prevent OA. Three specific aims are
proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will develop a superior disruptor peptide (SDP) to efficiently block the
interaction of beta-catenin with PTH1R and inhibit the beta-catenin-mediated PTH1R signaling switch. In Aim
2, we will establish whether the adeno-associated virus expressing SDP prevents cartilage lesions and
increase cartilage repair in a mouse OA model. Aim 3 will characterize mechanisms by which the SDP
regulates PTHrP effects on chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation and chondrocyte catabolism. Successful
completion of these studies therefore constitutes important preclinical findings that would facilitate
advancement of this work toward clinical trials of OA, and ultimate application in humans."

10913693,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the predominant cause of blindness in the United States.
Lipofuscin accumulation in the retina, which increases with age, is implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD.
Pyridinium bisretinoids constitute the primary cytotoxic elements of retinal lipofuscin. Inhibiting bisretinoid
synthesis is a viable approach for treating dry AMD. The synthesis of bisretinoids is driven by the traffic of
retinol from the bloodstream to the retina. The RBP4-Transthyretin (TTR) complex acts as the primary carrier
for delivering retinol to the eye. RBP4 antagonists displace retinol from RBP4, causing the RBP4-Transthyretin
(TTR) complex to dissociate. This reduces retinol transport to the eye and suppresses lipofuscin bisretinoid
synthesis in the retina. Fenretinide, a first-generation RBP4 antagonist, suppressed the expansion of atrophic
lesions in dry AMD patients when serum RBP4 levels fell below the 1-micromolar threshold. However,
selective RBP4 antagonists, by disrupting the RBP4-TTR interaction, could potentially destabilize wild-type
TTR tetramers promoting TTR aggregation in individuals with age-related predisposition to TTR amyloidosis
disease. We have recently introduced a novel class of bispecific RBP4/TTR ligands. These compounds not
only reduce serum RBP4 levels and suppress bisretinoid synthesis but also bind to the thyroxine binding sites
on TTR. This binding stabilizes TTR tetramers and prevents the formation of TTR amyloids. (R)-ACPHS-62, an
optimized bispecific RBP4/TTR ligand, emerged as a drug candidate for treatment of dry AMD in individuals
with age-related predisposition to TTR amyloidosis. The proposed project has two main objectives: first, to
perform experiments required to progress (R)-ACPHS-62 towards GLP-compliant IND-enabling studies (Aim 1;
R61 phase); and second, to carry out GLP-compliant IND-enabling studies and submit the IND application
(Aim 2; R33 phase)."

and fostering new paradigms in this fast-moving field. The 2024 GRC will continue this tradition of highlighting
research excellence in diverse areas of lipoprotein metabolism. The conference, to be held in Waterville Valley,
NH from June 2-7, will focus on important new developments in lipoprotein metabolism relevant to CVD, as well
as diabetes, obesity and neurological diseases. Oral presentations (in 9 integrated sessions) will highlight state-
of-the-art scientific approaches, exploring molecular, structural and cell biological studies, model systems of
metabolism, and preclinical and human studies of new therapeutic targets. The overarching goal is to bring
together scientists from diverse research areas, career stages, and geographical locations who share a passion
for discovering and applying new paradigms in lipoprotein metabolism to improve human health. The GRC will
be preceded by the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a forum for trainees to present their research in a setting
of mentorship and inspiration provided by peers and selected faculty in attendance. The First Aim of the 2024
GRC on Lipoprotein Metabolism is the communication of cutting-edge, unpublished science on lipoprotein
metabolism. This includes 34 presentations in 9 oral sessions, each with an identified theme and a discussion
leader who will facilitate dialogue and encourage participation by all attendees. Five of the oral sessions will
feature short presentations by trainees and early career investigators, selected from submitted abstracts by a
panel of established investigators. The roster of confirmed speakers is an impressive array of leading
researchers from a range of career stages, with robust representation of women and other under-represented

10909038,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts 69 million individuals worldwide every year. Despite its prevalence, TBI
continues to be undertreated, so much so that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dubbed it a
“silent epidemic”. TBI boasts no viable treatments, yet the long-term consequences can be profoundly disabling.
For example, up to 50% of TBI patients will develop chronic post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), and a majority will
report sleep disturbances like sleep fragmentation and insomnia.
 A leading candidate for the origin of these post-traumatic deficits is thalamic inflammation. Deep-brain
thalamic structures often show signs of robust gliosis and inflammation after TBI, even if the primary injury acutely
affects the cortex. The thalamus is a nexus for sleep, and its dense reciprocal connectivity with the cortex render
it highly epileptogenic. Studies in the Paz laboratory have shown that aberrant complement activation in the
thalamus, and in particular high levels of complement factor C1q, can lead to the development of post-traumatic
epileptic activity and a reduction in sleep spindles, electrophysiological signatures of non-REM sleep thought to
be crucial for memory consolidation. The question now remains how C1q exerts its maladaptive effects. The
proposed research will investigate the cellular source of maladaptive C1q through inducible genetic deletion,
EEG, and immunohistochemistry, and will determine the role that microglia—cells whose function in synaptic
pruning is known to be modulated by C1q—may play in mediating electrophysiological abnormalities due to C1q
(Aim 1). The proposed research will also explore the extent of the classical complement pathway’s participation
in the rise of epileptic events and sleep spindle loss by applying a highly novel nanobody against C4b, C1q’s
immediate downstream effector (Aim 2), coupled with many of the EEG and molecular techniques described in
Aim 1. These studies will be conducted with the ultimate goal of identifying avenues for potential therapeutic
treatment for TBI and its resultant deficits, including PTE and sleep disruption.
 All research will be conducted at UCSF and at Gladstone Institutes and will benefit from the wealth of
resources and training available at both institutions. They will be enriched by in-house data science and statistics
tools and courses, and profit from internal and external collaborations. All experiments will be guided by the
mentorship of supervising sponsor Dr. Jeanne Paz, and made available for feedback and presentation at
conferences and meetings."
10913762,"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has arisen as a powerful therapeutic modality for degrading
and eliminating cancer-causing proteins and has enabled potential access into classically

degraders that both use small-molecules to induce the proximity of E3 ubiquitin ligases with

Gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia are common disorders that can cause chronic
nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, and
malnutrition that may require nutritional support. The broad objectives of this proposal is
to improve our understanding of these disorders and advance the ability to diagnose and
treat them. We propose to do this through three specific aims, as follows:
Specific Aim 1: To successfully conclude ongoing studies that are currently being
performed by the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium.
Specific Aim 2: To initiate a new Gastroparesis Registry with inclusion of a larger
proportion of patients with idiopathic functional dyspepsia (GpR4 study)
Specific Aim 3: To characterize the role of aberrant macrophage activation in humans
with gastroparesis using pioglitazone (the “PIOGAS” study)
Through these aims, we will be able to conclude important ongoing studies (Specific Aim
1), expand the spectrum of gastroparesis by understanding its relationship to functional
dyspepsia (Specific Aim 2) and move closer to a cure for them (Specific Aim 3). Thus,
our goals are highly translational and of immediate and profound impact for the target

 The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University
of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently
has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental
biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational
genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the
PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.
 NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related
to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is
observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest
that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3
variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be
investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC
tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2,
through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of
pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize
cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated
(HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+
HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis
that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.
 The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed
address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2)
the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3)
identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.
 UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The
mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF
and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes
two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance."

also through what they can reveal about individual-specific patterns of brain development and
dysfunction. Given the central role the brain plays in personal identity, it is critical to understand
what human donors think and feel about brain organoids grown from their cells, and consider
whether organoid models of the brain deserve unique moral status compared to, for example,
lung or kidney organoids. The proposed research seeks to engage participants and other
stakeholders to explore ethical issues in brain organoid research, and thus addresses a core
principle of BRAIN Initiative: considering the ethical implications of neuroscience research. In Aim
1, qualitative interviews with current participants will be conducted to explore their perspectives
towards brain organoid research including beliefs about meaning, moral status, and permissible
uses of organoid tissue. In Aim 2, an educational video that describes brain organoids will be
imbedded into an online survey and used to measure attitudes in larger groups of stakeholders
who represent future participants in brain organoid research. In Aim 3, insights learned from
participants and stakeholders about preferences for brain organoid research will be compared to
current research practices and modifications to guide the field going forward will be proposed.
The long-term goal is to ensure that brain organoid research can achieve its scientific potential
and proceed in accordance with donor beliefs and values. The proposed research and training
plan will leverage expertise of an interdisciplinary team of mentors and strong
bioethics/neuroethics research environment across the University of Washington Center for
Neurotechnology and the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children’s.
During the mentored phase of the award, the applicant will gain new content knowledge in the
basic science of brain organoids, learn new skills for neuroscience communication, and complete
a master’s degree in bioethics. This additional training will equip the applicant with the skills
necessary to conduct the proposed research and transition into an independent faculty position."

Despite recent progress in cancer therapy, the brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) remains an extremely
challenging disease and new therapies are much needed. One of the biggest obstacles to effective treatment
of GBM is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents the passage of most drugs into the
brain. The highly invasive nature of GBM means there are always cells that remain after surgery in otherwise
normal brain tissue, and these cells are protected behind the BBB, preventing many therapeutics from reaching
them. To address this, we have formed a collaboration between Cho’s pre-clinical GBM therapeutics group at
BWH (PI), and Pentelute’s peptide chemistry group at MIT (Co-I) to develop a new therapeutics to 1) specifically
target GBM cells, and 2) cross the BBB. Our collaboration has identified a novel peptide, called BTP-7 that can
specifically target GBM cells and penetrate the BBB, serving as a promising agent to deliver potent anti-cancer
drugs to the tumor. The Pt(IV) drug has widespread clinical use for cancer treatment, but it is unable to cross
the BBB, leading to low brain uptake and limiting its effectiveness for treating GBM. Here, we propose to attach
Pt(IV) to BTP-7 (Pt(IV)-BTP-7), with the aim to increase Pt(IV) drug delivery to intracranial GBM tumors. Our
specific aims (SA) are as follows: SA 1. Analyze Pt(IV)-BTP-7 specificity to dg-Bcan and potential to cross the
BBB in vitro. SA 2. Investigate the biodistribution (BD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
Pt(IV)-BTP-7 in GBM bearing mice. SA 3. Evaluate the efficacy of Pt(IV)-BTP-7 drug in orthotopic GBM mouse
models. Our research findings could lead to the development of a highly efficacious therapeutic to benefit GBM
patients."

The vast expansion of the human cerebral cortex distinguishes us from our primate relatives, and this cortical
expansion is the foundation of uniquely human higher-order cognition. Numerous developmental innovations,
such as increased proliferation of cortical progenitor cells, contributed to this cortical growth. Ultimately, these
developmental innovations arose from genetic changes in the human lineage, which altered the molecular and
cellular programs underpinning development. Understanding the gene regulatory networks that specifically
inform human cortical development and cortical size is crucial for understanding the etiology of
neurodevelopmental disorders, which often present with cognitive impairment. Efforts to identify human-specific
genetic changes have revealed Human Accelerated Regions (HARs), which are highly conserved regulatory
elements that exhibit a high rate of human-specific sequence change. A growing body of evidence implicates
HARs in cortical development and evolution. In particular, the HAR HACNS205 has (i) human-biased
accessibility in cerebral organoids, compared to chimpanzee, and evidence of enhancer activity; (ii) an essential
role in human neural stem cell proliferation; and (iii) a known target gene in the fetal human cortex, BRN2, a
transcription factor that regulates corticogenesis and has human-biased expression in cortical progenitor cells
relative to chimp. BRN2 is an autism risk gene, and its target genes display enrichment for autism risk genes.
In addition, clinical work has linked BRN2 mutations to global developmental delay and cognitive impairment.
BRN2 has also recently been implicated in human cortical evolution. Overexpression studies indicate BRN2 is
important for designating neural progenitor cell identity, the timing of neurogenesis, and the production of specific
neuronal subtypes. However, the role of HACNS205 in human cortical development is not clear; moreover, the
role of BRN2 in early cortical development has not been reported. The goal of this proposal is to address these
gaps in the field, by using a humanized mouse model to study how HACNS205 impacts BRN2 expression levels
and BRN2 transcription factor binding, and how these primary molecular effects shape gene expression,
molecular networks, progenitor cell behavior, and the timing of key events in cortical development. Specifically,
I will employ genome-wide epigenetic and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of embryonic cortical development.
These results will then be leveraged to perform targeted phenotypic analysis of the developing cortex in these
mice, to identify HACNS205-driven shifts in progenitor cell behavior, neurogenesis, and ultimately cortical
morphology. The applicant’s long-term goal is to study the emergence of novel cell types in brain evolution. This
fellowship will aid the applicant in developing the expertise in bioinformatics and evolutionary, regulatory, and
functional genomics that will greatly bolster her success in this line of research, complementing her current
expertise in neurobiology and cortical development."
10917201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Attention is fundamental to parsing the dynamic, multisensory, and semantically rich environments we encounter
in day-to-day life. The human sensory systems take in more information each moment than can be processed
at once, so a subset must be prioritized for further processing through attentional mechanisms. Information about
the same object or event can be initially processed by multiple sensory organs, so signals from different sensory
systems must additionally be matched and integrated to create the perception of a coherent multisensory world.
Disruptions to these attention and sensory integration mechanisms are thought to underlie the sensory
processing issues commonly observed in neurodevelopment disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Patients either
under-respond or over-respond to common sensory stimuli, causing distress and difficulty completing the tasks
of daily life. The mechanisms underlying these sensory processing symptoms are ill defined because of critical
gaps in our understanding of how attention operates in multisensory environments. Attention has largely been
studied within each sensory system separately, thus many factors remain poorly understood in the audiovisual
contexts that more closely resemble the environments we encounter in daily life. In the proposed research, I will
investigate one of these factors, semantics, which is a critical guide of attention in vision but has only been
studied narrowly in audiovisual contexts with stimuli that shared a source (e.g., a dog and its' bark). This narrow
focus means the mechanism of audiovisual attention benefit remains unknown and could include any semantic
relationship (a semantic-general mechanism) or be specific to the relationship of sharing a source (a source-
specific mechanism). In Aim 1, I will characterize the degree to which semantic relatedness influences attentional
prioritization, which will be measured both by visual search efficiency in study 1 and prioritization in early visual
cortex at object locations in study 2. Attentional prioritization that scales with semantic relatedness would suggest
a semantic-general mechanism. In Aim 2, I will identify the neural mechanism of the shared-source benefit in
audiovisual search, specifically examining the time course to understand the relative contributions of attentional
and semantic processing. Investigating these mechanisms will provide a more robust understanding of the role
of semantics in guiding attention in real world environments, which are frequently both multisensory and
semantically rich. Ultimately, understanding basic attentional principles will support future research into the
sensory processing issues so common in neurodevelopment disease, including potential treatments that allow
patients to better manage sensory under- and over-responsiveness."

Despite remarkable achievements in HIV prevention and treatment in the United States, significant gaps in
sex-and-gender-specific health education remain for clinicians caring women with HIV (WWH), stemming their
ability to reduce morbidity and mortality, resulting in inequitable health outcomes. WWH are a highly vulnerable
aging population who experience complex physical, psychological, and social health challenges, and research
and clinical guidelines to inform the care of WWH at midlife and beyond are limited. This paucity stems
clinicians’ ability to provide comprehensive care to WWH at midlife. Midlife is an important phase in the aging
trajectory when women enter menopause, a sex and hormone-specific transition period of reproductive health.
Midlife is a critical time for general preventative health screenings and the assessment of menopause-
associated symptoms and conditions, some of which exist prematurely in WWH, including osteoporosis, heart
disease, mood and sleep disturbance, and hot flashes. Collectively, these conditions deleteriously impact the
health and quality of life of midlife WWH. In this proposal we will develop, implement, and evaluate a virtual
education program called “EMPOWHer” Embracing Midlife and Menopause Positively: Offerings by Women
with HIV, aimed to enhance clinician knowledge and confidence with providing midlife health and menopause
care to WWH. The EMPOWHer program will be co-created by WWH (including transgender women) from
diverse US geographic regions in partnership with transdisciplinary and transprofessional clinicians and
researchers to communicate sex and gender related science, and clinical and social support needs. The virtual
EMPOWHer program and related resources will be made publicly available to clinicians providing care to
WWH via the EMPOWHer website link, which will be shared with national HIV community organizations, HIV
clinics in the outpatient/inpatient area, and provider education forums. Further, insights gained from
establishing, implementing, and evaluating the EMPOWHer program will be shared to extend its reach and
impact, and inform the future development of similar programs for vulnerable populations of women."

The Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) Pharmacological Treatments Comparative
Effectiveness Trial is a multisite study that examine the long- and short-term outcomes for neonates with
NOWS that require pharmacological treatment. The neonates will be randomized to three medications:
buprenorphine, methadone and morphine. Short term outcomes are anticipated to include length of hospital
stay and length of pharmacological treatment, with longer term outcomes including neonatal growth and
neurodevelopment. The common protocol will be developed by a steering committee composed of the
principal investigators from each participating clinical center. The trial will be designed to control for relevant
clinical variables including the type of maternal opioid used, maternal polysubstance use including tobacco,
the use of nonpharmacological treatments for NOWS, and the use of adjunctive nonopioid medications. The
follow-up plan will be developed as part of the protocol and will extend until at least 24 months of age and
include the use of specific neurodevelopmental assessment tools including the Bayley Scales of Infant and
Toddler Development 4th Edition. The trial is designed to determine the optimal pharmacological treatment
including the specific medication dosing and weaning regimen. The University of New Mexico Clinical Center
will include infants treated for NOWS across all neonatal care sites including the mother baby unit where
dyadic room-in care is provided, the intermediate care nursery, and the neonatal intensive care unit. The
standardization of pharmacological treatment for NOWS is anticipated to have significant public health
benefits including decreasing length of hospital stay, decreasing cost of treatment, and potentially improving
long term neurodevelopmental outcomes."

Adolescent girls and young women represent the fastest growing population of persons living with HIV in Kenya,
contributing nearly 40% of new HIV infections. This pattern jeopardizes efforts to address HIV in infants and
contributes to the sustained epidemic of pediatric HIV. Kenya had impressive gains in preventing vertical HIV
transmission in the early years of the epidemic, however these gains have been reversed in recent years and
Kenya’s current vertical HIV transmission rate of >8% is unacceptably high. In Kenya, clinician-scientists played
a major role in anchoring the early HIV response yet there are limited opportunities for career development in
Kenya for individuals with a clinical background who wish to continue in clinical practice and teaching while
building a research career in an academic setting. The majority of successful Kenyan clinician-scientists have
been trained overseas, highlighting the need to develop and scale-up research-oriented training programs in
Kenya. This application therefore seeks to strengthen the research training opportunities in Kenya for clinicians
who want to develop careers as independent researchers through the proposed program, “Research Training
on HIV Prevention and Treatment in Children and Adolescents.” The program will be led by Drs. Dalton Wamalwa
and Ruth Nduati at the University of Nairobi (UoN) and co-directed with Dr. Carey Farquhar at University of
Washington (UW), Bernard Awuonda at Maseno University (MU) and Kenneth Ngure at Jomo Kenyatta
University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). The program will offer long-term training which includes
doctoral-level training in Epidemiology (5 trainees) and in Biostatistics (1 trainee) at UoN (3-4 years) and master’s
level training in biostatistics (1 trainee) in Seattle (1.5 years). The program will also offer a 15-week synchronous
online Advanced Certificate in Research to clinicians at UoN, MU and JKUAT (doctors, nurses and pharmacists)
in master’s programs with an interest in pediatric and adolescent HIV (75 per year, 300 total), as well as a
combination of in-person advanced short courses and workshops conducted in collaboration with partner
institutions. The Principal Investigators have substantial experience with Fogarty training programs and other
training programs based in Kenya. They will work closely with members of a Steering Committee with
representatives from all 4 institutions and an external Training Advisory Committee (TAC) to ensure success of
each trainee and the overall program. Together, all the partners and the extensive network of faculty will work
towards a goal of strengthening evidence-based approaches to prevent and treat pediatric and adolescent HIV
and conduct locally relevant research in Kenya."
10912658,"Project Summary: Macrophage Determinants of Retinal Regeneration
The objective of this proposal is to understand microglia and macrophage ontogeny, dynamics, and
endogenous roles in retinal degeneration and regeneration using the zebrafish as a model, a vertebrate
organism capable of robust retinal regeneration following a variety of insults. Humans do not possess this
regenerative capacity both in contexts of acute retinal damage or in neurodegenerative diseases of the retina,
although microglia and macrophages are active participants in the response to neuronal death, and
macrophages are able to drive wound healing in peripheral tissues. Further, in some contexts, microglia and
macrophages appear to contribute to pathology, though modulation of such pathological contributions has not
been achieved. In order to provide future therapeutic and regenerative strategies to support endogenous
microglia/macrophage-specific mechanisms that positively regulate the outcome of regeneration and/or impart
the capacity to perform such functions through strategic manipulation, more foundational knowledge is
required. We propose that a thorough understanding of microglia and macrophage functions in a system of
robust retinal regeneration (specifically, the zebrafish) will reveal microglia and macrophage functions that can
ultimately be harnessed to mitigate neuroinflammation and support attempts at retinal regeneration in humans.
 Our published and preliminary data indicate that in zebrafish, both retinal resident microglia and extra-
retinally derived macrophages are present in degenerating and regenerating retinal tissue following an acute
cytotoxic lesion, and these microglia/macrophages intimately interact with regenerative Müller glia, the cell type
acting as the source of regenerated neurons. Transcriptional profiling of microglia/macrophages during active
Müller glia-mediated regeneration indicates functional changes in microglia/macrophages compared to steady-
state. Our preliminary data also indicate that altering microglial phenotype to a pro-inflammatory state may
contribute to neuronal degeneration. We hypothesize that microglia and macrophages perform crucial
functions in shaping the outcome of retinal degeneration and regeneration. The following Specific Aims will test
this hypothesis. 1. Determine the extent and duration of microglia and macrophage heterogeneity following
retinal injury. 2. Determine how pro-inflammatory macrophages affect retinal degeneration and regeneration. 3.
Determine endogenous function(s) of microglia and macrophages in retinal regeneration. Findings from this
proposal will (I) provide crucial knowledge and tools towards future research to identify microglia vs.
macrophage-specific molecular mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration and successful regeneration and
(II) facilitate comparative studies to identify key factors and mechanisms that determine outcome (pathology
vs. regeneration) following retinal damage in zebrafish compared to mammals. Collectively, this new
knowledge will provide foundations towards successful design and application of therapeutic strategies for
human retinal damage and disease."
10912826,"Abstract
Socket augmentation after tooth extraction by placing either allograft or xenograft bone particulates in the
socket is frequently applied to reduce the jawbone volume shrinkage for subsequent implant placement.
Socket healing after augmentation varies largely, ranging from uneventful healing to infection, failure of bone
graft integration and severe bone loss due to bacterial infection and/or local/systemic conditions. The healing
duration, which dictates the timing of implant placement, is widely different as well. Currently, an arbitrary
waiting time of 6 months after socket augmentation is adopted, when a 2-dimensional (2-D) or 3-D radiograph,
along with a visual examination is performed to assess hard- and soft-tissue healing to determine the
readiness and strategy for implant surgery. However, 3-D radiographs are not recommended for longitudinal
use to monitor socket healing due to radiation concerns. They have low image resolution (250-500 µm), which
limits their ability to evaluate bone surface healing, and have inferior soft-tissue contrast. A non-radiation and
point-of-care method that can evaluate both hard- and soft-tissue longitudinally is much needed for a definitive,
accurate, and timely diagnosis of socket healing pathologies. A high-frequency and miniature-sized intraoral
ultrasound probe that can operate on an off-the-shelf scanner has been manufactured in collaboration with
industry by our research team. Research conducted by our group demonstrated accuracy of this probe in
measuring various oral and dental structures. The central hypothesis is to develop ultrasound-based imaging
to characterize and grade socket healing lesions in determining their extent and severity. To test this
hypothesis, two aims are proposed in this proposal. Aim 1. Evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasound
images for bone grafting procedures of dental extraction sockets in a longitudinal clinical study (from -2
months to +6 months of graft placement). We will compare other imaging and clinical diagnostic tools for
assessing hard- and soft-tissue, anatomical and physiological status throughout the longitudinal study time-
course. Aim 2. Develop a concave extended-view transducer array for acquiring large view-angle
jawbone images and determine buccal to lingual tissue morphology. We will engage the manufacturer to
create an extended aperture transducer for this specific dental application. Design goals will include the
creation of an extended, large angle, field-of-view to visualize the buccal to lingual jawbone surface. We will
also further our existing machine learning (ML) based measurement tools, including soft- and hard-tissue
dimensions and crestal bone surface analysis to yield an ultrasound-based bone quality classification system.
Successful execution of the proposed aims will result in a clinical tool for longitudinal socket augmentation
evaluation that is based on ultrasound soft- and hard-tissue features and will allow the care provider to choose
deviations from current clinical procedures where indicated. Those would be investigated subsequently in a
specifically designed clinical trial."
10912830,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating and progressive disease without a cure. Neuroinflammation is now
recognized as a key early event in the development of AD. Aberrant neuroinflammatory response activates
immune cells that can increase oxidative stress, and oxidative stress can directly damage neurons and axons,
cause demyelination, and break down the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, damaging neuroinflammation is
emerging to be a potential treatment target. A non-invasive imaging method to detect and assess early
damaging neuroinflammation would be able to detect disease before irreversible damage occurs, and enable
monitoring of disease progression and treatment response of current and emerging therapies. However,
current clinical imaging technologies do not distinguish between damaging and reparative inflammation. The
goal of this proposal is to develop an imaging method to detect and monitor oxidative stress and consequent
damaging neuroinflammation in AD. We hypothesize that such an imaging technology will allow early detection
of damaging neuroinflammation in AD patients, enable timely treatment decisions, predict progression, and
allow non-invasive monitoring of treatment response, particularly for emerging anti-inflammatory therapies. We
have found that myeloperoxidase (MPO) is highly expressed by pro-inflammatory cells but not by reparative
cells. MPO is a key mediator of oxidative inflammation and has been found to be associated with AD. An
increased number of MPO immunoreactive cells have been found in the brains of early AD patients, but not in
the brains of normal patients. We have developed an activatable MPO-PET imaging agent (18F-EH301) that
can cross the BBB to enable imaging of MPO activity in AD. In Phase 1 we will establish that 18F-EH301 can
specifically detect oxidative stress in the brain in the 5XFAD mouse AD model. In Phase 2 we will use 18F-
EH301 PET imaging to a) longitudinally track the evolution of oxidative stress in the brain in different AD
models, b) compare and correlate with other AD imaging agents: 18F-FDG (glucose metabolism), 18F-florbetapir
(β-amyloid), 18F-flortaucipir (tau), 11C-PBR28 (translocator protein), and c) monitor treatment changes using an
MPO inhibitor (verdiperstat) with and without donezepil. Finally, to enable clinical translation of this technology,
we will synthesize 18F-EH301 under cGMP conditions and perform GLP toxicology studies in rats. This
proposal addresses the NIA priority of development and validation of innovative diagnostic tests and novel
biomarkers to identify or predict age-related decline, dysfunction, diseases, and conditions, including
Alzheimer's disease and AD-related dementias. The output of this proposal will be a translational MPO-
targeting PET imaging method with demonstrated efficacy to report damaging neuroinflammation in AD for
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. This project will directly enable first-in-man clinical trials to test
MPO imaging in human AD and potentially other diseases in which MPO is implicated."
10912831,"Project Summary: Transthyretin Amyloidosis with cardiac myopathy, ATTR-CM, represent a serious
healthcare issue. ATTR-CM is involved in 13% of heart failure, 16% of transcatheter aortic-valve replacement,
and 5% of individuals with presumed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The primary challenge is that most
patients are undiagnosed or their diagnosis is delayed for multiple years. Since the damage ATTR-CM causes
to the heart is progressive, diagnosis delays strongly impact prognosis and increase mortality. Diagnosis is
problematic for two reasons: ATTR-CM has a variable presentation and the prevalence is not high. Thus,
ATTR-CM is often not considered during diagnosis and a more common diagnosis with similar symptoms is
given erroneously. Up to 98% of patients are not diagnosed due to the low prevalence and variable
presentation. One study found that 32% of ATTR-CM patients had previously been misdiagnosed as having
more common cardiovascular diseases. A readily-available genetic test can be used to detect hATTR and
99mTc-DPD-scintigraphy can be used to diagnose ATTR-CM (both hereditary and wild type). Fortunately,
once diagnosed, ATTR is treatable. Thus, the main challenge for ATTR-CM is diagnosis, not therapy. An
effective and economical precision screening system is needed to find the individuals most at risk of ATTR-
CM. Those identified via precision screening could be tested and, treated with effective therapy resulting in
saved lives and reduced healthcare costs. Atomo’s goal in this SBIR Fast-Track proposal is to create, optimize
and implement an AI-based Clinical Decisions Support System (CDSS) to identify probable yet undiagnosed
ATTR patients before they develop CM. For this work, we are partnering with Dr. Dan Rader and PENN
Medicine. Dr. Rader is the Seymour Gray Professor of Molecular Medicine and Chair of the Department of
Genetics at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Rader also directs the
Penn Medicine Biobank. We would utilize the BioBank to identify True Positive patients to train and evaluate
an AI model to find probable yet undiagnosed ATTR individuals. The model would be used in a pilot, most
likely as a quality improvement initiative. To complete this work, Atomo will leverage its proven ML
technologies that have been used and verified clinically, with published in peer-reviewed journals. The ATTR
AI model would be commercialized as an Insights As A Service (IaaS) CDSS."

The International Narcotics Research Conference (INRC) is the world’s foremost organization of scientists
dedicated to the study of opioids. Research into narcotics and addiction is moving rapidly with groundbreaking
new techniques in neuroscience and in the structural biology of receptors. The INRC meets each year and is
the premier meeting for dissemination and coordination of this important and innovative information. At the
INRC meeting the most recent research is presented describing advances in the area of endogenous opioids,
opioid receptors, opiate drug pharmacology, opiate tolerance, dependence and addiction and cross-talk with
other neurotransmitter systems, especially since the opioid system has been recognized as central to addiction
to a variety of substances. This basic science is necessary to pave the way for translation into clinical
advances in pain and addiction treatment. Particularly now, with an opiate epidemic, it is crucial that we
maintain our momentum to understand the biology behind opioid abuse and develop novel treatment agents. In
addition, INRC is an essential forum to develop younger, minority and women scientists to enter the opioid
research field and carry on the tradition of high-quality cutting-edge science. This application seeks to advance
these aims by providing support for five upcoming INRC meetings, 2020-2024. The majority of the funds will
be used for financial assistance to allow junior, minority and women scientists to attend and participate in the
conference. A smaller portion will help defray the cost of invited plenary and symposium speakers who do not
normally conduct drug abuse research, but provide a fresh outlook and/or findings in areas complementary to
drug abuse research, and also support a small portion of the administrative costs of running the conference.
This multi-year grant will provide for a changing emphasis to highlight specific themes in the basic science of
addiction and, by providing continuity, will nurture early career investigators to mature into the future
generation of drug abuse researchers and develop them to be leaders in the field."
10912712,"Background: Despite increasing cannabis use among the general population, very little data exists on
potential harms associated with use. In randomized controlled trials examining the effect of THC-based
pharmaceuticals on the management of pain, adverse events included dizziness, sedation, confusion, loss of
balance, nausea, vomiting, and hallucination. These side effects suggest that cannabis used in combination
with opioids—which also cause, dizziness, sedation, confusion, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting and
constipation—may be particularly harmful. Older Veterans, and those with underlying respiratory and cardiac
conditions, may be at higher risk of adverse effects from combined opioid and cannabis use. On the other
hand, several ecological studies suggest that state-based recreational legalization may be associated with a
decrease in opioid related deaths. Thus, it is plausible that cannabis use, by reducing the use of opioids,
reduces respiratory depression and the risk of overdose. However, ecological studies examining the effect of
legalization on opioid related deaths do not inform our understanding of the effects of combined use of
cannabis and opioids on individual health. Understanding the effects of the combined use of cannabis and
opioids on individual patient outcomes is critically important. No evidence base is currently available to inform
VA guidelines on cannabis use among chronic pain patients who receive opiates.
 Significance: Although cannabis use is common among Veterans with chronic pain, the risk or benefits
of cannabis use among Veterans on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) is unknown. This proposal is directly
responsive to research gaps identified by VA practice guidelines and the HSR&D priority area focused on
“Studying safety and efficacy issues related to long-term opioid therapy among aging Veterans and Veterans
with mental health (non-pain) conditions”. Our proposal is also responsive to the HSR&D priority area:
“Assessing the feasibility of LTOT cohort studies using data-mining strategies.”
 Innovation: To address the gaps in the literature on the potential harms (or benefits) of cannabis use
among patients on long-term opioid therapy, we propose an innovative approach to cohort construction using a
combination of urine drug screen data, text processing algorithms (developed by our team), and national VA
and Medicare data to categorize exposure status (concomitant cannabis plus opioid vs. opioid without
cannabis) to address the following aims:
 Specific Aims: Aim 1: To examine the association of cannabis use on the outcome of all-cause
mortality among Veterans ≥18 years-old who use long-term opioids. Aim 2: To examine the association of
cannabis use on the primary outcome of all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes of hospitalization
among Veterans ≥65 years-old on LTOT with chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure or
sleep apnea. Aim 3: To examine the association of cannabis on the primary outcome of all-cause mortality and
the secondary outcomes of any hospitalization, fall-related injury, any injury, and hospitalization for mood
disorders among Veterans ≥65 years-old on LTOT.
 Methodology: We will leverage VA data sources and use data extracted from progress notes, urine
toxicology data, and national VA and Medicare administrative data to answer a clinically relevant question. We
will use propensity score methods to compare one-year outcomes among cannabis users and non-users.
 Next Steps: Next steps include dissemination of the findings to VA researchers and clinical and
operational leaders. Study findings will be informative to VA guidelines and clinical practice."

Early diagnosis of cancer can improve therapeutic effect and prolong patient survival. The increasingly
sensitive and widely adopted early cancer screening technologies have led to significantly more detection
of early lesions that may or may not progress to cancer. Elucidating the mechanisms that drive or restrain
early cancer would allow differentiation of aggressive cancer versus indolent types, improving
personalized treatment and avoiding over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Whether an early lesion
progress to cancer or not is not solely decided by the molecular profile of the lesion but also is impacted
by the surrounding microenvironment and mediated by other epidemiologic factors. Meanwhile, the
progression of an early lesion to malignancy is a complex process that may take years to occur. The
complexities of the problem highlight the unmet needs for researchers from basic to translational science
to collaborate and coordinate in the research of the underlying mechanisms between early lesion and
cancer development. In response to RFA-CA-21-055, we propose a Coordinating and Data Management
Center (CDMC) for the Translational and Basic Science Research in Early Lesions (TBEL) Program. The
CDMC interacts closely with other entities of the Program, including the Steering Committee, the
Research Centers, biospecimen and image repository, pathology centers, sequencing facilities, Data and
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and NCI, and provides critical scientific, administrative, regulatory,
managerial, logistic, and data-analytic support to the TBEL Program. Our proposed CDMC infrastructure
and operating procedures have been time-tested in an ongoing NIH-funded Consortium for the Study of
Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer. Specifically, the proposed work includes the three
aspects of required responsibilities: consortium coordination (Aim 1), statistical and computational
support (Aim 2), and data management, study protocol development and implementation (Aim 3). Our
team of experts include information technology specialists who have been supporting and developing
innovative software tools for numerous basic and translation cancer studies, experienced research
coordinators who have worked on both NIH- and industry-funded multicenter studies, and faculty
statisticians and bioinformaticians who have led CDMC work for large NIH consortiums and are well-
known experts in biostatistics and bioinformatics methodological research areas closely related to
biomarker development, risk prediction, single cell analysis, image analysis, machine learning, and
clinical trials."

The goal of our proposed Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) application is to coordinate the
activities across the Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet), and to manage, integrate and
disseminate the data and resources generated through the network. Leveraging cutting-edge multi-disciplinary
team approaches, we will support the ARTNet to inform new strategies that can be better translated to overcome
significant challenges in acquired resistance to cancer therapies. Our strategy is to enhance the productivity of
ARTNet investigators by fostering a collaborative and supportive research community, accelerate the progress
of ARTNet research by reducing barriers to accessing analytical expertise, ensure the reproducibility of ARTNet
data by deploying best practices for data acquisition and harmonization, and unleash the full potential of ARTNet
activities by developing enhanced tools to enable resource sharing to the broader scientific community.
First, we will provide a centralized administrative infrastructure to coordinate ARTNet activities, building upon
our well-functioning infrastructure that currently coordinates network studies under the umbrella of the NCI
Cancer Moonshot initiatives. Second, we will actively promote the ARTNet and engage in trans-consortium
interactions, where we will leverage our demonstrable experience in Cross-Moonshot outreach and
Bioconductor’s decades-long record in community engagement. Third, we will provide multidisciplinary analytical
expertise to support ARTNet collaborative research, leveraging five of Roswell Park CCSG’s shared resources:
Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Informatics, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, and Data Bank and
BioRepository. Our analytical support will be provided at no cost to ARTNet investigators in need of analytical
expertise, based on collaboration, transparency, and sharing. Fourth, we will develop improved data integration
software and workflows to enhance ARTNet’s research capacity, capitalizing on our extensive track-record in

11010061,"Project Summary
The goal of our proposed Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) application is to coordinate the
activities across the Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet), and to manage, integrate and
disseminate the data and resources generated through the network. Leveraging cutting-edge multi-disciplinary
team approaches, we will support the ARTNet to inform new strategies that can be better translated to overcome
significant challenges in acquired resistance to cancer therapies. Our strategy is to enhance the productivity of
ARTNet investigators by fostering a collaborative and supportive research community, accelerate the progress
of ARTNet research by reducing barriers to accessing analytical expertise, ensure the reproducibility of ARTNet
data by deploying best practices for data acquisition and harmonization, and unleash the full potential of ARTNet
activities by developing enhanced tools to enable resource sharing to the broader scientific community.
First, we will provide a centralized administrative infrastructure to coordinate ARTNet activities, building upon
our well-functioning infrastructure that currently coordinates network studies under the umbrella of the NCI
Cancer Moonshot initiatives. Second, we will actively promote the ARTNet and engage in trans-consortium
interactions, where we will leverage our demonstrable experience in Cross-Moonshot outreach and
Bioconductor’s decades-long record in community engagement. Third, we will provide multidisciplinary analytical
expertise to support ARTNet collaborative research, leveraging five of Roswell Park CCSG’s shared resources:
Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Informatics, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, and Data Bank and
BioRepository. Our analytical support will be provided at no cost to ARTNet investigators in need of analytical
expertise, based on collaboration, transparency, and sharing. Fourth, we will develop improved data integration
software and workflows to enhance ARTNet’s research capacity, capitalizing on our extensive track-record in
developing NIH-supported Moonshot, Bioconductor and AnVIL ecosystems.

10911882,"Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have substantially higher incidence of bone disorders, including as
much as a 64% greater risk of fracture as compared to those without T2D. High blood glucose levels adversely
alter bone cell functions, causing decreased bone formation and delayed wound healing with poor quality
tissue repair. Therefore, diabetic bone disease (DBD) is a serious health concern for more than 40 million
people in the US and 370 million in the world currently afflicted with T2D. Current treatments for DBD include
anti-resorptive drugs, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and anabolic (bone-forming) drugs. However,
these drugs target either the bone-formation or bone-resorption pathway, not both. Moreover, these drugs have
little direct effect on diabetic hyperglycemia, a major root cause of T2D bone disorders. Furthermore, recent data
indicate some anti-diabetic drugs have side effects that actually increase fracture risk in T2D. Therefore,
developing a safe and effective method to prevent DBD and restore and regenerate lost bone tissue in diabetics
is critically important. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of non-protein-coding transcripts with length
longer than 200 nucleotides. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs play important roles in gene expression
and are involved the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Currently, there are over 60 clinical trials using
lncRNAs as a remedy. Our laboratory has recently identified and initially characterized a specific lncRNA that
promotes osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis in diabetes. It can recruit KDM6B and KDM4B and influence
the histone methylation of relevant genes. Its deficiency causes bone abnormalities and retards bone
regeneration and delays wound healing in mouse models. This newly discovered lncRNA is therefore coined
“lncR-DBD”, suggesting its potential roles in targeting the pathophysiology of diabetic bone disease. We have
successfully generated a lncR-DBD gene knockout mouse line which will enable us to further dissect the
biological function of this new lncRNA. Aim 1 will determine the cellular localization of lncR-DBD and explore
the epigenetic pathways using the state-of-the-art approaches; Aim 2 will define the mechanisms and alterations
in bone phenotype in lncR-DBD knockout mice; Aim 3 will use a novel nanohydrogel delivery system to
investigate the therapeutic effects of lncR-DBD on bone wound repair and fracture healing in diabetic mice. The
outcome of our study will provide a paradigm shift in current understanding of the pathophysiology of DBD and
have a significant impact on the future treatment of this epidemic disease. Firstly, building on our preliminary
findings that lncR-DBD plays a pivotal role in bone metabolism, this project will further reveal novel epigenetic
mechanisms of DBD. Secondly, we will decipher the pathways of lncR-DBD modulating genes in the diabetic
microenvironment, which will lead to discovery of new therapeutic targets. Finally, we will deliver the lncR-DBD
mimics using a novel nanohydrogel system as a safe, effective means for lncRNA-based therapy. An
interdisciplinary team of investigators with complementary and synergistic skills will conduct the studies."
10913505,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition characterized by atypical social communication,
rigid thinking, and repetitive behavior that is becoming increasingly prevalent, with 1 in every
54 children meeting the diagnostic criteria. ASD signs and symptoms can vary broadly in their
presentation, from relatively mild impairments to symptoms severe enough that they prevent
individuals with ASD from living independently. Social support and early intervention therapies
however can significantly ameliorate the severity of several ASD symptoms. Notably, the
younger children are when therapies and interventions are begun, the more effective they will
ultimately be. While children can be reliably diagnosed with ASD at as young as 18 months, the
average age at time of diagnosis is 4.5 years which means that children with ASD often miss
therapeutic opportunities for lack of a diagnoses. Delayed diagnoses are especially common in
children from rural communities. Research that investigated possible causes for delayed ASD
diagnoses in rural communities found lack of parental knowledge about ASD, hesitancy among
clinicians to diagnose young children with ASD, and a lack of knowledge regarding steps to take
to have a child tested for ASD to be significant factors. In order to address ASD-related
disparities in rural communities, we created a webpage dedicated to helping families and
individuals effected by ASD navigate the diagnostic process. Our webpage directs users to ASD
“on-boarding’ organizations, and also has resources for finding early intervention therapy
centers near their home communities, provides links to financial resources, and links to
community based support organizations. We would like to expand our webpage into an online
ASD ToolKit that will be reviewed by rural families who have a child with ASD. Our ToolKit will
also give families opportunities to direct content creation by soliciting families’ input through
user feedback questions and focus groups. The goal of the ASD ToolKit is to create an easy to
use guide for living with and managing ASD in rural Georgia that has been shaped insights from
families affected by ASD. We will also create an online course about ASD diagnosis and
resources for rural physicians that will be informed by input from families affected by ASD. We
will invite feedback from our targeted physicians though user feedback questions and an ASD
resources quiz. Ultimately, we will use the physician input we receive on the course to develop
a continuing medical education (CME) program that will be available through Project ECHO."
10913421,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goals of this project are to a) understand the epidemiology of Human papillomavirus virus (HPV)-
associated oral and oropharyngeal cancers (OOPC) among people living with HIV (PLWH) as well as the role of
epigenetic biomarkers in OOPC, and b) to develop potential targeted interventions to improve prevention and
early detection of OOPC. HPV causes ~5% of cancers worldwide, including an increasing proportion of OOPCs;
our recent data showed that 17% of OOPC samples have HPV infections. This worsening public health problem
is even more serious in countries with high HIV prevalence, such as Nigeria. The impact of HIV infection on
immune dysfunction promotes transmission and reactivation of oncogenic HPV co-infections. HIV-HPV co-
infection then synergistically increases the prevalence of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), and the
hazards of progression to OOPC among PLWH. As HIV is controlled with antiretroviral therapy (ART), PLWH
live longer with chronic inflammation and continued immunodeficiency, making them even more susceptible to
HPV infection and its cancer-promoting consequences. Epigenetic biomarkers represent a field with untapped
potential for identifying HPV-infected PLWH who are at risk of progression to invasive OOPC. DNA methylation
(DNAm) modifications are a well-studied epigenetic mechanism in cancer including OOPC. DNAm modifications
are inducible by exogenous factors, including HIV and HPV infection and their associated cancers. Countries
like Nigeria provide unique resources and opportunities to study HPV-associated cancers in PLWH, particularly
longitudinal studies of the progression of OPMDs into malignant OOPCs. We hypothesize that oral HPV infection
may induce DNAm changes in PLWH, some of which are mechanisms in OOPC development. Such changes
may differ by HPV subtype, and can be seen in OPMDs that predict the progression to invasive OOPC. We plan
to examine tissue-specific epigenetic biomarkers in 4 groups of HIV(+) patients: 1) HPV(+) OOPC (n=150); 2)
HPV(-) OOPC (n=150); 3) HPV(+) with benign warts (n=100), and 4) HPV(+) with OPMDs (n=400). Recruitment
will be conducted at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan/University College Hospital (COMUI/UCH) in
Nigeria, West Africa as well as 10 other hospital satellite recruitment sites. COMUI/UCH is the largest radiation
oncology referral site in Nigeria and one of the leading centers for oncological services in the region. We will also
study HIV (-) OOPC patients derived from our existing cohort (SHINI) in the same area. Our primary Aims are
to: 1) Understand the epidemiology of HPV-associated OOPCs in PLWH; 2) Identify DNAm biomarkers of HPV-
associated OOPCs in PLWH; and 3) Examine DNAm biomarkers for OOPC aggressiveness and OPMD
progression during follow up. Our research team has a long and successful collaboration record and the
Northwestern University MPIs have extensive experience studying HPV-associated cervical cancer in PLWH
through an NCI-funded U54 consortium in Nigeria."
10913533,"Total knee replacement (TKR) is commonly used to reduce pain and improve function in patients with
advanced, symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). While more than 80% of patients undergoing TKR report
improved pain and functional status, growing evidence suggests that post-TKR physical activity (PA) does not
surpass pre-TKR levels. Given the substantial time and financial investment associated with TKR and the rich
evidence supporting health benefits of PA, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TKR could be
meaningfully enhanced if TKR recipients would be more physically active. The period following acute TKR
rehabilitation provides a unique window of opportunity for these patients to transform their lifestyles. This
proposal addresses whether introducing behavioral strategies that incorporate both intrinsic and extrinsic
motivators can help TKR recipients engage in sustained, meaningful PA. Telephonic active coaching with
motivational interviewing (TAC(MI)) uses regular conversations to resolve ambivalence and identify means of
overcoming barriers to PA. Financial incentives (FI) address the temporal delay between completing healthy
behaviors and receiving long-term health benefits by offering immediate rewards contingent on activity and
performance. With these behavioral, psychological and economic principles in mind, we propose KArAT
(Knee Arthroplasty Activity Trial). The long-term objective of this research is to determine the most
effective and cost-effective behavioral interventions post-TKR to help patients develop a sustained
commitment to becoming physically active. We plan to conduct a three-arm parallel RCT to establish the
efficacy of personalized intervention built on the principles of behavioral science and behavioral economics in
improving PA among patients who have undergone TKR. The three arms will include: Arm 1: Usual Care (UC);
Arm 2: Attention Control (AC); Arm 3: Telephonic Active Coaching (Motivational Interviewing) + Financial
Incentives (TAC(MI)+FI). In general, RCTs focus on either treatment-specific effect or total treatment effect.
In this application, we propose a design that will permit us to estimate both. By including a ‘usual care’ arm, we
will be able to estimate the overall effect of the intervention, which is relevant to estimating the value of the
intervention and understanding the impact on clinical practice. The primary outcome will be the proportion of
individuals engaging in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at ≥3
METs by the end of the six-month intervention. Change in average daily step count from pre-TKR to the end of
the six-month intervention; change in weekly minutes of MVPA; reduction in sedentary time; and
sustainability of efficacy at 12, 18 and 24 months post-TKR will be secondary outcomes. The results from
KArAT will help clinicians, patients and policymakers make evidence-based decisions about improving PA after
TKR, one of the most common orthopedic surgeries."

Small vessel cerebrovascular disease is common in the elderly, and is a well-known contributor to cognitive
decline. A major gap in the field, however, is the ongoing need for reliable and reproducible biologic markers of
vascular disease suitable for early detection, disease monitoring, and measuring treatment efficacy. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to clinically validate novel neuroimaging and fluid-based biomarkers of
cerebrovascular disease selected by the NINDs and developed during the first five years of the MarkVCID
consortium. We propose to longitudinally follow a cohort of 200 diverse, older subjects who present with a
range of cerebrovascular burden and cognitive complaints and functional decline. Our aims are to validate the
MarkVCID biomarkers and address possible interactions between these biomarkers and Alzheimer’s disease
pathophysiology. Accomplishing these goals will improve early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of small
vessel cerebrovascular disease in older subjects and provide better targets and outcome metrics for clinical
trials."

Americans ≥65 years represent a growing segment of the US population who use cannabis for multiple ailments,
increasing about two-fold from 2015 to 2018. Despite these trends, knowledge about how the aging process
combined with comorbidities or genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes alter the safety of cannabis
remains limited. This knowledge gap is particularly worrisome given nearly all 50 states have passed some
legislation allowing legal medical cannabis use and that the elderly are more vulnerable to adverse drug events.
The non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) and psychoactive ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most
extensively studied cannabinoids in cannabis. CBD has been the top-selling herbal supplement ingredient in the
US natural channel since 2018. CBD received particular interest from the elderly suffering comorbidities who are
poorly managed with current treatments. CBD is eliminated from the body mainly by hepatic cytochrome P450
(CYP)-mediated metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP3A). Mean THC concentration in cannabis-related products was
reported to increase 2-fold from 2008 to 2017. THC is eliminated mainly by hepatic CYP-mediated metabolism,
primarily by CYP2C9, with a minor contribution by CYP3A. Biotransformation activity generally tends to slow with
age due to decreased blood flow and reduced liver mass. Both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 harbor multiple reduced
function genetic variants that could further reduce the safety of CBD and THC. Therefore, the elderly with hepatic
impairment or carrying such genetic variants may be at heightened risk for adverse events from CBD and THC.
Collectively, there is an urgent and critical need to understand how comorbidities such as hepatic impairment,
along with select CYP variants, affect CBD and THC disposition in the elderly.
Because conducting clinical trials in the elderly can be challenging, model-based approaches such as
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation can be used to project systemic
exposure to CBD and THC. The objective of this project is to incorporate age-related physiological changes,
hepatic impairment, and select CYP genetic variants, as well as oral or inhaled CBD- and THC-specific
characteristics, into novel PBPK models to predict CBD and THC disposition in hepatic-impaired elderly patients
(65-98 years) and assess the combined effects of age and genetic CYP polymorphisms on CBD and THC
exposure. We will (1) quantify the effects of age on oral and inhaled CBD and THC disposition and (2) develop
PBPK models to predict both oral and inhaled CBD and THC exposure in elderly patients with hepatic impairment
and (3) assess the impact of select CYP genetic variants on oral and inhaled CBD and THC exposure in the
elderly. Results from this project are expected to provide critical and timely data to inform consumers and health
care professionals about the safety linked to CBD and THC use among the elderly with and without hepatic
impairment or select CYP genetic variants. Importantly, results will lay the foundation for future benefit/risk
assessment of the complex natural cannabinoid mixture (cannabis/marijuana/hemp) in this special population."
10913555,"Summary: Spectacular recent advances in single cell genomics have provided high-resolution information
about cell identity, however relating molecular information to the spatial and temporal context remains a
major challenge. This is particularly relevant for the immune system, since immune responses occur in
highly organized tissue environments, and involve tightly-controlled changes in cell state over time. Here
we propose to develop new approaches to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of single cell
analyses, and to use these methods to generate and then disseminate a 4-dimensional (time and 3D
spatial coordinates) map of T cell development and the associated microenvironment in the thymus. In
Aim 1, we will use simultaneous measurement of mRNA and surface proteins on single cells, together with
computation and experimental approaches to develop a temporal map of cell state transitions during T cell
development in the thymus. In Aim 2, we will use coherent Raman and multiphoton microscopy of living
thymic tissue slices, together with laser microdissection, to isolate functionally relevant regions of tissues.
We will then perform single cell analyses of individual cells within these defined regions and use
computational analyses to define cell types and resolve cellular cross-talk. In Aim 3, we will increase the
value of this resource to the scientific community, we will make the data readily accessible to researchers
via a user-friendly interface.

10914685,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The most severe cases of TMJ disorders consist of mandibular condyle degeneration. Unfortunately, no
regenerative options exist, and current treatments do not restore full function. The articulating tissue of the
condyle is a fibrocartilage that consists of an intricate interface between fibrous, cartilaginous, and boney
tissue that is essential for normal function and that is lost in severe TMJ disorders. The objective of this study
is to regenerate fibrocartilage-bone interface of the mandibular condyle in skeletally mature goats using a
comprehensive tissue engineering approach. I hypothesize that a multilayer scaffold will allow for site-specific
fibrous-cartilage-bone regeneration of the mandibular condyle cartilage when compared to a homogenous
sponge scaffold and untreated control defects. First, I will study the properties of a multilayer scaffold design
in-vitro. I will characterize the permeability and release of TGFβs from the scaffold. Second, I will study the
regeneration potential of three cell subpopulations found on the condyle. Third, I will implant our scaffold in
mandibular condyle defects of goats and assess their potential for functional regeneration. This proposal
highlights the contributions that the PI will make throughout the duration of the training, which will
primarily focus on the completion of scaffold fabrication and characterization, as well as the study of
the regenerative potential of TMJ cells subpopulations in vitro and of our bilayer scaffold in vivo.
Successful completion of this proposal is the critical step to providing a regenerative therapy to treat TMJ
mandibular cartilage degeneration and a basis for successful osteochondral tissue regeneration in other sites."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Neuroimmune Interactions: Nervous System
and Immune Cell Heterogeneity in Health and Disease, organized by Drs. Nicola Allen, Anna Victoria Molofsky
and Francisco Quintana. The conference will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico from June 3-6, 2024.
Interactions between the nervous system and the immune system are increasingly recognized as being essential
to health throughout the human lifespan and are known contributors to dysfunction in neurological disorders.
This Keystone Symposia conference explores emerging topics in neuroscience, immunology and
neuroimmunology to present the latest cutting-edge research across these increasingly connected disciplines.
Technological advancements are defining the heterogeneity of immune cells and their targets in the central
nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), as well as across states, so this conference
program was designed to explore these intersections. Additional sessions will explore how this heterogeneity
impacts both organismal health and behavior, as well as the function of the immune system itself. Other topics
included on the program will focus on neuroimmune interactions in disease; impact of pathogens on brain
function; immune regulation of behavior; glial interactions in neuroimmune signaling; brain-periphery
interactions; and microglia function. Finally, this conference on Neuroimmune Interactions will be paired with
another Keystone Symposia conference on Neurodegenerative Diseases, which will be held jointly at the same
location and with overlapping programming. This topical pairing is ideal due to the strong involvement of immune
pathways in multiple neurodegenerative disorders and the joint meeting format will enable attendees to learn
about the latest research in both fields, through attendance of joint sessions and informal interactions at meals,
poster sessions and conference activities."

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignancy associated with infection by human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV). As a cancer of endothelial origin that typically grows under the skin or mucous membranes, KS in
AIDS patients mostly manifests as oral lesions. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a member
of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family, has been shown to be an etiologic agent of all
forms of KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease.
Currently, no drugs specifically targeting lytic replication of KSHV are available. Additionally, atomic structures
of KSHV viral genome packaging/ejection machinery and fusion-mediating glycoproteins needed for rational
design of antiviral drugs and vaccines are unavailable. The prior four-years' funding of this multiple principal
investigator (MPI) R01 project has led to the publication of the atomic structure of the KSHV capsid in Nature.
Structure-guided mutagenesis studies have identified amino acid interactions among capsid proteins that are
essential to capsid assembly and informed the design of small peptide mimics that inhibited viral maturation.
Jointly, the MPIs' groups also published the first atomic model of the KSHV DNA-packaging portal complex and
capsid associated tegument complexes in Cell. Preliminary data for this renewal application have established
the feasibility of obtaining in situ structures of genome-packaging portal-terminase complex and the cell-entry
glycoprotein B (gB) in both pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations. These portal protein and envelope
glycoprotein structures and structure-guided mutagenesis results have led to three hypotheses: (1) the portal-
associated proteins and terminase interactions are vital to KSHV genome encapsidation; (2) the interactions
and conformational changes among envelope glycoproteins are required for KSHV fusion with host cells during
cell entry; and (3) such interactions revealed in atomic structures can help design inhibitors and vaccines
against KSHV lytic infection.
The studies described in this application will test the above hypotheses by taking advantage of technology
breakthroughs in high-resolution cryoEM and KSHV mutagenesis already demonstrated in the two MPIs' labs in
the current funding cycle. In Aim 1, we will determine the in situ structures of KSHV portal-associated proteins
and the terminase to ~3Å by cryoEM. From these structures, we will derive atomic models and identify amino-
acid residues within 6 Å of interacting proteins (i.e., residues vital to DNA packaging and ejection). In Aim 2, we
will determine the structures of major envelope glycoproteins to ~3Å. Specifically, we will characterize the pre-
fusion and post-fusion states of gB and the interactions of gH/gL, gM/gN, and K8.1A with their binding partners.
In Aim 3, we will refine our structural interpretation through structure-guided mutagenesis and identify target
sites for inhibition of genome encapsidation and membrane fusion. Results from this research program will
inform future development of drugs and novel vaccines against KSHV infection and spread. The novel
approach established will be generally applicable to other viruses and complexes."
10908303,"ABSTRACT
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is among the world’s most common inherited blood disorders, and causes severe morbidity and early
mortality. SCA is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting over 300,000 births annually, with an estimated 30% increase
in the next generation. To address the burden of SCA within Africa, neonatal screening is needed to establish the proper
diagnosis, and hydroxyurea treatment is needed to ameliorate morbidity and decrease mortality. Hydroxyurea is listed by
the World Health Organization as an Essential Medicine for children with SCA, representing the only realistic and affordable
disease-modifying therapy in this setting. Until recently, hydroxyurea had been studied primarily in high-income countries,
with virtually no data available regarding its safe and effective use in Africa. To address this critical unmet need, we designed
and launched REACH (Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea, NCT01966731), a prospective open-label
study of hydroxyurea for young children with SCA in sub-Saharan Africa. In the current funding period, 606 children in four
African countries received hydroxyurea escalated to maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Despite COVID, our research teams in
Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and Uganda collected unprecedented data on the safety, feasibility, and
benefits of hydroxyurea for SCA in Africa, with >3000 patient-years of treatment. We documented reductions in sickle-
related clinical events and found unexpected reductions in malaria, transfusions, and death. We performed whole exome
sequencing to investigate inter-patient variability including hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
pharmacogenomics. In the renewal, we will make additional contributions by extending hydroxyurea treatment to this
unique cohort, whose average age is now 11 years and soon entering puberty, using a continued supply of hydroxyurea
donated by Bristol Myers Squibb. Though our initial results are encouraging, REACH does not have a placebo-controlled
cohort for comparison. Accordingly, we will enroll a new cohort of age-matched children with SCA at all four sites, to provide
pre-treatment data for comparison to our treated cohort. In the first specific aim, we will assess the long-term effects of
hydroxyurea at MTD to ameliorate SCA-related clinical complications and preserve organ function (especially brain but
also kidneys, spleen, and eyes). We will obtain longitudinal data on the effects of hydroxyurea at MTD on physical
growth, sexual development, and overall reproductive health, and collect serial DNA to test for the emergence of clonal
hematopoiesis. In the second aim, we will investigate mechanisms by which hydroxyurea reduces malaria infections,
combining epidemiological data with in vitro parasite invasion assays and an agnostic search for protective genetic
polymorphisms. In the third aim, we will simplify and optimize hydroxyurea treatment using novel and innovative
approaches, by testing the feasibility and safety of a pharmacokinetics-based dosing algorithm in the new patient cohort
to minimize dose adjustments and lab monitoring, and then by validating our newly identified genetic polymorphisms
that predict HbF treatment responses. REACH will expand hydroxyurea treatment in Africa, build local capacity, and
establish a robust research infrastructure for future collaborations, including planned NIH curative therapies. REACH is
uniquely poised to elucidate benefits and risks of extended hydroxyurea, allowing safe and evidence-based dosing in Africa."
10908304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The creation of highly innovative solutions to complex problems impacting human health requires
research teams that are rich in cognitive diversity. Cognitive diversity represents the bringing together of
people with different backgrounds, viewpoints, and life experiences and is a hallmark of highly innovative
teams. Cognitive diversity correlates with identity diversity; it is thus imperative that the translational
biomedical sciences workforce includes strong representation of Ph.D. scientists from diverse
backgrounds that may imbue new ideas and perspectives to maximize scientific innovation.
Unfortunately, cognitive diversity in research teams is currently limited because individuals from specific
racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and individuals with low socioeconomic backgrounds,
remain significantly underrepresented (UR) in the biomedical sciences. Here, we propose to develop,
apply, and evaluate a Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that will help prepare
recent college graduates from UR backgrounds to enter and successfully complete a Ph.D. or dual-
doctoral degree program in translational biomedical sciences. At Purdue University, PREP Scholars will
have the opportunity to enhance their skill set in four main areas: research aptitude; academics;
professional development and career planning; and community and resiliency. Scholars will engage in a
yearlong, mentored research experience with an emphasis on preclinical translational studies. The
Purdue PREP curriculum is adaptive; Scholars will use an Individual Development Plan (IDP) as a
framework and will participate in the educational, professional development, and career planning
activities that prepare them for admission to high caliber graduate programs and are aligned with their
future career goals. Scholars will be introduced to the breadth of biomedical research and research-
related careers along the translational pipeline available to a Ph.D. scientist. The Purdue PREP will
adopt a multi-layered, hierarchical approach to mentoring in which each Scholar will work with a network
of faculty and near-peer mentors with complementary skills that will provide a broad range of expertise
and psychosocial support to enhance Scholars' success. PREP faculty mentors and Scholars will
undergo parallel cultural competency training focused on issues of diversity and inclusion as they relate
to the academic research environment in order to improve cross-cultural communication and enhance UR
student experience. Success will be measured by > 75% of Scholars entering a high quality Ph.D. or
dual-doctoral (e.g. DVM-Ph.D.; MD-Ph.D.) degree program upon completion of the one-year Purdue
PREP. Formative and summative evaluations will be used to assess Scholars' persistence and
progression to a Ph.D. and also the impact of the PREP on fostering an institutional climate of diversity
that may enhance UR retention."
10908384,"Relationship between maternal and fetal immune responses
The fetal immune system starts to develop in the third week of gestation and progresses until birth. During this
time, it is greatly influenced by maternal events. HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HEU) provide an excellent
example in which neonates at birth have multiple immunologic differences compared with HIV-unexposed
uninfected infants (HUU) that persist for months to years and, despite the absence of HIV infection, result in an
increased risk of severe infection, hospitalization and death. Other maternal medical conditions can also affect
the fetal immune system, such as chronic hepatitis B infection, type 1 diabetes and obesity. The mechanism
whereby the maternal and fetal immune systems communicate is not known. We hypothesized that the fetal
immune system receives instructions from the mother through small molecules or nanoparticles
resulting in common immunologic biases between maternal-fetal dyads. In this study, we will investigate
maternal metabolites, cytokines/chemokines, placental hormones and extracellular vesicles (EV) as potential
mediators of the cross talk between maternal and fetal immune systems. To test this hypothesis, we will
leverage paired CBMC and maternal PBMC from women with and without HIV collected in a previous NIAID-
funded study. In the current study, we formulated the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To determine the breadth of the immunologic characteristics shared by mothers with and without
HIV and their fetuses.
Using high-dimensional flow cytometry, Cite-seq and ATAC-seq we will determine the phenotypic, transcriptomic
and epigenetic profiles of maternal and fetal T cells and antigen presenting cells and identify characteristics
shared by mother-fetus dyads both unique and common to HEU and HUU dyads.
Aim 2. To identify metabolites, maternal hormones, cytokines/chemokines and/or EV shared by
maternal-fetal dyads that distinguish HEU from HUU dyads.
We will characterize maternal and fetal metabolomic, proteomic, hormonal and EV plasma profiles to identify the
factors that are shared between maternal-fetal dyads. We will then identify those that are specific to HEU
compared with HUU dyads.
Aim 3. To identify mediators of the communication between the maternal and fetal immune systems.
Using a transwell system to simulate the placental barrier, we will examine functional and phenotypic changes
in the Treg CBMC induced by maternal factors.
Impact. We will study maternal-fetal information transfer that programs the HUMAN fetal immune system. This
is a critical step in devising interventions to mitigate fetal immune dysfunctions. By leveraging resources from a
prior NIAID-funded study, we will be able to use multi-omics to maximize the depth of these pioneering studies."
10908385,"Summary
In neural networks that store information in their connection weights, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity
and stability. Connections must be plastic to incorporate new information, but if they are too plastic, stored
information can be corrupted. Therefore, it would be useful if learning rates in the brain were regulated by a
“when-to-learn” signal that varies with the current availability of new information. In reward learning,
dopamine is known to serve this function, by rapidly upregulate synaptic plasticity in response to reward
prediction errors. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that dopamine also provides a when-to-learn
signal for spatial learning. During spatial learning, new information is generally available when an organism is
moving through space. Thus, we hypothesize that spatial learning is modulated by dopamine release that is
specifically linked to active movements. This idea is attractive because it can provide an explanation for why so
many dopamine neurons are time-locked to movements. This proposal outlines three projects, all focusing on
spatial learning in the central complex, the primary center for spatial navigation in the Drosophila brain. In
each project, there is anatomical evidence from the Drosophila connectome that implies a role for dopamine
neurons. Moreover, in each project, there is already evidence that the dopamine neurons in question are active
when the fly is locomoting. This motivates our hypothesis that dopamine links movement to spatial learning.
Although these projects are linked conceptually, they each focus on a distinct dopamine cell type, and a distinct
form of spatial learning. First, we will determine how dopamine modulates learning about spatial position cues
in the head direction system. Second, we will investigate the hypothesis that dopamine modulates learning
about rotational velocity cues in the head direction system. Third, we will investigate the hypothesis that a
feedback circuit integrates information over time to discount the influence of environmental wind shifts on
head direction neurons. In all three projects, we use connectome analyses and computational modeling to
generate testable predictions about specific networks in the brain. Then, we test these predictions using in vivo
calcium imaging and/or electrophysiology as flies navigate in virtual reality environments. Our results should
shed light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying navigation behaviors in all complex species, including
ring attractor networks, Hebbian learning rules, and feedback loops. Broadly speaking, we think that dopamine
provides a control knob for modulating these mechanisms up or down. As such, we see dopaminergic neurons
as an entry point for an integrative understanding of network dynamics during complex cognitive processes."

 T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy. Despite
successes in curing pediatric T-ALL with intensive chemotherapy, the majority of adult T-ALL patients will relapse
and die of their disease. We and others have demonstrated that in T-ALL, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
generates energy and metabolic intermediates necessary to promote growth and support survival, by regulation
of mitochondrial Complex I (CI). This unique metabolic and mitochondrial biology makes T-ALL vulnerable to
strategies that target OxPhos.
 We have identified a first-in-class nanomolar-potent inhibitor of OxPhos (OxPhosi), IACS-010759, that
inhibits CI of the OxPhos respiratory chain, blocks oxygen consumption, and destabilizes Hypoxia-Inducible
Factor 1α (HIF-1α). Our data demonstrated profound growth-inhibitory effects of this agent in T-ALL cell lines
and primary ALL cells at low nM concentrations, with minimal toxicity against normal BM cells. OxPhos blockade
in vivo was tolerable as a single agent, yet had only a modest therapeutic benefit. However, targeting the
OxPhos-driven biology of T-ALL is likely to be effective in the right combinations. We have demonstrated synergy
of IACS-010759 with standard chemotherapy agents used in T-ALL, both in vitro and in the in vivo T-ALL PDX
models. We will translate these findings in our Aim 3, by a Phase I/II clinical trial of IACS-010759 combined with
a modified hyperCVAD/L-asparaginase regimen in relapsed/refractory ALL patients, using the recommended
Phase 2 dose of IACS-010759 from the ongoing AML trial. Matching pre-clinical studies on T-ALL PDX models
in Aim 1 will develop biomarkers of response in ways not possible in human subjects. We have further identified
a synthetically lethal combination in T-ALL cells of OxPhosi with an inhibitor of the lactate transporter MCT1
(AZD3965, now in Phase 2 trials), and in Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms of this synergy. We will also
characterize the effect of HIF-1α blockade by IACS-010759 on T-ALL cells using in vivo two-photon imaging of
metabolic NADH and oxygen sensing by phosphorescence lifetime microscopy. Finally, we will conduct further
screening with a novel high-content metabolomic drug library to identify other combinations with IACS-010759
that are toxic to T-ALL cells but not normal cells, for future therapeutic applications.
 We believe that the proposed studies will provide mechanistic insights into the newfound vulnerability of
T-ALL to OxPhosi; identify candidate predictive biomarkers for the combination of IACS-010759 with
chemotherapy or MCT1 inhibitor; and develop combinations for the next generation of OxPhosi trials for T-ALL."
10918312,"The outer blood retina barrier (oBRB) comprises of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and underlying
fenestrated choriocapillaris (CC) that interfaces with the blood supply. The RPE-CC complex functions
synergistically to support photoreceptor cell health that is critical for vision. Consistently, dysfunction of the RPE-
CC leads to retinal degeneration in myraid eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD),
the single biggest cause of irreversible blindness in adults > 50 years of age in the US. However, the lack of in
vitro tissue mimetics that faithfully recapitulate the RPE-CC complex has significantly impaired the study of
normal and diseased physiology of the oBRB. A major challenge for the development of RPE-CC tissue mimetics
is our limited understanding of human retinogenesis. This is especially relevant to the CC layer in which the
majority of inferences are drawn from histological studies of embryonic human retina. Human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a unique platform to develop in vitro oBRB models. Indeed, several studies have
now shown that specific cell types relevant to the RPE-CC complex, including RPE, endothelial cells (ECs) and
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be differentiated from hiPSCs. Furthermore, we have recently developed
a primitive RPE-CC tissue mimetic by exploiting the versatility of poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG) hydrogel-based
engineered ECM (eECM) and hiPSC-derived target cells to emulate the spatial organization of RPE, ECs, and
mesenchyme. The RPE-CC tissue mimetic is able to recapitulate important physiological features of the in vivo
RPE-CC complex, such as CC-like fenestrated vasculature, that had previously been elusive in vitro. Although
this model provides a framework for physiological RPE-CC development, it currently has several limitations,
including unoptimized eECM biochemical and biophysical cues, lack of developmentally-instructed temporal cell-
cell cues, and absence of vascular perfusion, resulting in a tissue model that does not fully recapitulate in vivo
structure (e.g., well-defined Bruch’s membrane-like ECM and CC spatial angioarchitecture) and function (e.g.,
nutrient transport and macromolecular diffusion). In this proposal, we hypothesize that better understanding of
the eECM requirements (Aim 1), ii) incorporation of temporal developmental cues (Aim 2), and integration of
vascular perfusion, (Aim 3) will promote development of modular, spatially relevant, and functional RPE-CC
tissue mimetic(s). Ultimately, the development of a physiological and modular human outer retina (RPE-CC)
tissue mimetic will have important implications for subsequent disease modeling, drug screening, and
transplantation studies."

10914879,"Project Summary
The discipline of biomedical informatics is primed to foster scientific innovation and advance health equity. To truly harness the potential of multitude of methods, theories, and application in the field of the informatics, there is pressing need to enhance the diversity of the research community. Recent educational research suggests that intentional connections to culture, community, and local needs may be critical to welcoming and retaining individuals that are traditionally marginalized in biomedical research. Place-based education, a form of community-based learning, aims for purposeful student engagement that is responsive to local environmental and health needs, including its history, culture, people, and ecology. Such learning cultivates critical and analytical skills and actively engages students in real-world problem solving and holds much potential for increasing student engagement in scientific research as well as in interdisciplinary areas such as informatics. In this project, we propose to develop a truly interdisciplinary, Place-based Culturally responsive Health Informatics Research Education (PHIRE) program that brings together expertise from data science, systems science and engineering, health informatics, and public health and infuses regional assets and needs from the community into the training and curricula. The vision of the PHIRE training program is to recruit and prepare a diverse pool of 60 undergraduate students (12 students per year) to conduct scientific research in health informatics with an inherent focus on addressing health disparities and public health needs. The PHIRE training program includes three major components: (1) a 12-week summer research experience, (2) a thematic undergraduate minor in health informatics, and (3) preparation for graduate school or other research careers in health informatics."
10920061,"ABSTRACT
While T cell therapies have shown efficacy in hematologic malignancies, extension of this success to solid tumors
has proven to be challenging, mainly due to the immunosuppressive and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME).
Marker proposes to overcome the immunosuppressive TME by developing a secreted recombinant fusion
protein, DECOY. The purpose of the DECOY protein is to transform the immunosuppressive TME into one that
will support therapeutic T cell growth and function. We therefore propose a binary strategy for T cell therapy, as
a combination of two T cell products. Product #1 consists of DECOY-producing T cells that will be delivered to
the tumor and has the ability to alter the TME, making conditions more favorable for subsequent T cell therapy.
Product #2 is MT-601, our autologous multi-tumor associated antigen (mTAA)-specific T cell product that
recognizes 6 antigens present in pancreatic cancer cells. It has shown an excellent safety profile and initial
efficacy in a clinical trial in advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The purpose of the combination of DECOY
with MT-601 is to further improve our initial clinical efficacy by protecting MT-601 T cells from the
immunosuppressive TME. The rationale for the binary delivery system is to maintain the safety profile of MT-601
T cells by separating the delivery of DECOY T cells. In essence, this strategy separates the fuel (DECOY) from
the engine (MT 601) driving anti-tumor activity, providing the operator with the ability to control the engine by
adding more or less fuel. This binary approach will overcome strategies implemented by the tumor to evade
immune surveillance. In this project, we will evaluate the kinetics and parameters to guide clinical application of
Product #1 (DECOY), determine the optimal clinical administration of Product #2 (MT-601) when combined with
Product #1 (DECOY), and perform GMP-compliant validation and engineering runs for clinical implementation
of the binary product strategy. Successful completion of this project will result in the amendment of our FDA-
approved MT-601 IND that will use a binary product strategy that uses DECOY (Product #1) to enhance cancer
killing capabilities of mTAA-specific T cells - MT-601 (Product #2) in pancreatic cancer. This application will
therefore pave the way towards clinical implementation of a binary product strategy to address an unmet clinical
need for pancreatic cancer patients. If successful, this binary strategy will allow for a faster extension to other
adoptive T cell therapies and/or cancer indications for the purpose of increasing cell product potency while
maintaining the safety profile."

10914112,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for some hematologic malignancies, and
it often requires a 3-4-week hospitalization. Notwithstanding the promising nature, the transplantation process
and recovery is intensive and fraught with potential life-threatening complications during acute and long-term
recovery. Hence, allogeneic transplant recipients have a high burden of psychological distress, and quality of life
(QOL) deficits are common. Most efforts to achieve optimal psychological well-being in this population have
targeted the reduction of distress symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety). However, positive psychological
well-being (e.g., optimism, positive affect) can buffer against this distress and has been prospectively associated
with improved QOL, physical functioning, and survival in allogeneic transplant patients. Positive psychological
interventions (PPIs), which utilize systematic activities (e.g., recalling positive life events, using personal
strengths) to promote psychological well-being, have consistently and durably enhanced psychological health
and QOL in medical settings, but have never been used in allogeneic transplant patients. Given the need for
new programs to promote well-being and recovery after allogeneic transplantation, the proposed project will
develop and test a novel PPI in allogeneic transplant recipients, PATH (Positive psychology for Allogeneic
Transplantation of Hematopoietic stem cells), to fill this unmet need. Principal Investigator Dr. Amonoo will
develop the PATH intervention via a review of the literature and application of a theoretical framework and test
its acceptability (via quantitative participant ratings and qualitative feedback at exit interviews) in a one-arm proof-
of-concept trial (N=10; Aim 1). Next, Dr. Amonoo will test the feasibility (primary outcome) and preliminary
efficacy of the PATH intervention (refined using Aim 1) on psychological, functional, and behavioral outcomes in
a pilot randomized controlled trial with 70 allogeneic transplant recipients (Aim 2). Finally, in Aim 3, Dr. Amonoo
will use individual semi-structured interviews with Aim 2 pilot trial participants and 20 oncology clinicians to
explore the facilitators and barriers to implementing PATH in clinical settings. This project will facilitate training
essential to Dr. Amonoo’s research career goals: intervention development, clinical trial design and execution,
advanced biostatistics, and implementation science. Dr. Amonoo has assembled dedicated mentors who are
renowned researchers with complementary expertise: PPI trials in medical populations (primary mentor: Jeff
Huffman, MD), supportive oncology interventions (co-mentor: Areej El-Jawahri, MD), quantitative methods (co-
mentor: William Pirl, MD), implementation science (co-mentor: Elyse Park, PhD, MPH), and biostatistics
(research advisor: Brian Healy, PhD). Dr. Amonoo’s mentorship will be supplemented by structured coursework,
seminars, and conferences. In sum, this K08 award will prepare Dr. Amonoo to become an independent R01-
funded investigator and leader who develops novel evidence-based supportive care interventions to improve
health outcomes for allogeneic transplant patients and other vulnerable cancer populations."
10914116,"Project Summary
 Early detection of melanoma is a key factor in improving patient survival and decreasing treatment
costs. The sensitivity of dermoscopy, the standard of care in the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions, was
reported to be highly variable, ranging between 68-96%, depending on the proficiency of the physician and the
stage of the lesion. Low sensitivity reflects high rates of false-negative findings, which delay diagnosis and
treatment. Thus doctors must err on the side of caution, which leads to an excess of unnecessary biopsies and
increased medical costs. Distinguishing cutaneous melanoma from benign melanocytic nevi with high accuracy
based on dermoscopy remains a challenge even when in the hands of expert clinicians since this approach
only offers a two-dimensional image of the lesion's superficial structure. Ultimately, a biopsy is necessary for
definitive diagnosis by the dermatopathologist, but this too may be affected by inter-observer variability,
resulting in discordant conclusions. A study performed at the Melanoma Center, at UCSF estimated that
214,500 to 643,500 cases of melanocytic neoplasms in the United States would be diagnosed differently by
another dermatopathologist, annually, which has significant consequences for the patient regardless of the
nature of the lesion. We propose to develop and clinically evaluate a fast, large area multiphoton exoscope
(FLAME) as a tool for non-invasive imaging and early detection of melanoma in order to reduce false positives
and false negatives in both dermoscopy and histopathology. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is a nonlinear
optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals
such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two-photon excited fluorescence from NAD(P)H/FAD+,
keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that macroscopic areas of skin
(cm2 scale) could be mapped out with microscopic resolution within ~2 minutes by combining optical and
mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration. As required by PAR-20-155 our
academic-industrial partnership will deliver a powerful MPM imaging tool to clinicians for non-invasive, real-
time quantitative assessment at the bedside that would not require specialized training. Our proposed
application is for early diagnosis of melanoma, but the approach will have wider impact, for rapid, in vivo
characterization of cellular morphologic and metabolic imaging endpoints in patients. Our specifics aims are:
(1) to develop FLAME, a compact, portable MPM prototype system for rapid, depth-resolved in vivo imaging of
skin, over macroscopic areas (cm2-scale) with microscopic resolution and enhanced molecular contrast; (2) to
implement safety features and demonstrate the technical feasibility; (3) to test the performance of FLAME by
evaluating its ability to provide in vivo quantitative optical endpoints with sufficiently high predictive power to
reliably distinguish benign from early melanoma lesions. We are a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from
UC Irvine, Vidrio Technologies, LLC and Tufts University with 3 to 8 years record of collaboration."

This proposal describes a five-year career development program to prepare the candidate, Dr. Jinhwan Kim, for 
a career as an independent investigator. This program will build on Dr. Kim’s background as a material scientist 
and nanobiomaterial engineer by providing additional expertise in medical imaging, cell engineering, and 
nanomaterials. The primary mentor, Stanislav Emelianov, Ph.D. (Professor of BME at Georgia Tech), has 
expertise in instrumentation, imaging systems and algorithms, image-guided therapy, and imaging contrast 
agents. Co-mentors are Younan Xia, Ph.D. (Professor of BME at Georgia Tech), who has expertise in 
nanoparticles and Gabriel Kwong, Ph.D. (Associate Professor of BME at Georgia Tech), whose expertise in T 
cell engineering. Dr. Kim will collaborate with Kevin Kalinsky, M.D. (Associate Professor of Medicine at Emory 
University) on breast cancer oncology, Haydn Kissick, Ph.D. (Assistant Professor of Urology at Emory University) 
on cancer immunology, and Krishnendu Roy, Ph.D. (Professor of BME at Georgia Tech) on T cell manufacturing.
In this application, Dr. Kim will demonstrate the use of plasmonic nanoparticles with tunable peak optical 
absorption as contrast agents for the combined ultrasound and photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging. The developed 
imaging agents and US/PA system will be used for image-guided chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy 
in breast cancer and sensing the activity of delivered CAR T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Current 
approaches in CAR T cell therapy lack the ability to monitor the location and activity of the infused CAR T cells 
in real-time, which is critical to understand the biological effect of CAR T cells and to predict the treatment 
outcome. By labeling CAR T cells with gold nanorods (AuNRs) absorbing in near-infrared (NIR) spectral range, 
this project aims to enable tracking of the CAR T cells after infusion for image-guided therapy (Aim 1). 
Implementing the US/PA imaging technique will allow the real-time, high-resolution detection of the CAR T cells 
with great anatomical information in reliable imaging depth (Aim 2). Furthermore, the design of the gold 
nanoparticle-based US/PA imaging sensors that selectively and sensitively detect cytokines released from 
injected CAR T cells will enable monitoring CAR T cell activity, thereby assessing and controlling the 
microenvironment with additional external stimulation (Aim 3). Aims 1 and 2 (K99 phase) will be guided under 
the strong mentorship from mentor/co-mentors with extensive training on nanotechnology (Younan Xia, Ph.D.), 
CAR T cell engineering (Gabriel Kwong, Ph.D.), and US/PA imaging (Stanislav Emelianov, Ph.D.). Dr. Kim will 
independently conduct the proposed aim 3 with the extended expertise gathered during the K99 phase. The 
multidisciplinary knowledge gained during the overall research and career training, this project will provide a 
foundation for Dr. Kim – an independent investigator in the R00 phase, to develop advanced applications of 
nanotechnology in innovative therapeutic approaches to treat cancer and other diseases."
10919236,"Cervical cancer is the leading female cancer in Uganda. Many women are diagnosed with late-stage 
disease, and 80% of women die within 5 years of diagnosis, making primary prevention critical. HPV is the 
principal cause of cervical cancer, making vaccination the single most important primary preventive measure.
The national HPV vaccination program in Uganda began in November 2015 and focuses solely on 
preteen/adolescent girls. Two strategies have been adopted for the multi-dose series: 1) school-based and 2) 
community-based. However, in Kampala, only 29% of girls receive both needed doses. Reasons for under
vaccination include school absenteeism on special vaccination days for those receiving vaccination as part of a 
school program, failing to remember to come to a health facility for a needed dose for those being vaccinated 
in the community, and lack of knowledge regarding HPV and the vaccines including vaccine misperceptions. 
While research regarding the use of text message vaccine reminders is strong in the U.S., their use has not 
yet been demonstrated in a preteen/adolescent population in Sub-Saharan African or other low- and middleincome countries (LMICs). According to the World Bank, currently 89.9% of urban households in Uganda have 
a cell phone. This study will take place at three health centres and their affiliated schools and community 
immunization centers overseen by the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) as well as at the 
Makerere/Mulago/Columbia Adolescent Health Clinic, also in Kampala. While text messages can be used in 
populations with low literacy, families can opt to receive automated phone call reminders instead.
R21: Aim 1: Identify desired HPV vaccine text message reminder content (and parallel automated phone 
reminders) using key informant interviews We will conduct formative research using key informant interviews 
with stakeholders at each site as well as policy makers. Aim 2: Develop and pretest HPV vaccine reminders 
with target population We will share prototypes of the designed messages with families to identify issues with 
clarity, tone, and persuasiveness. Aim 3: Pilot assess the impact of vaccine reminders on HPV vaccination We 
will randomize caregivers of preteens/adolescents at one KCCA site and the adolescent clinic, stratified by site,
language and HPV vaccine dose needed (initiation vs. completion). Feasibility milestones will include reach, 
effect size determination and implementation measures. R33: Aim 4: Conduct a full-scale randomized-control 
trial to assess the impact of text message reminders on HPV vaccination We will conduct a full-scale RCT 
assessing the impact of the HPV vaccine text message reminders. The main outcome will be timeliness of 
vaccination. We will also collect process/feasibility measures. This project, if successful, will provide an 
important foundation not only for the use of HPV vaccine text message reminders in Uganda but also for other 
childhood and adolescent vaccinations in Uganda and in other LMICs."

Mutant forms of KRAS are a key driver in human tumors but remain partially refractory to therapeutic 
intervention. After over three decades of research, only a single inhibitor (sotorasib) targeting a single 
mutation (KRASG12C) have reached market. The difficulty for developing small molecule KRAS inhibitors 
has heightened the importance of alternative methods targeting the oncogene. One such strategy 
involves therapeutic nucleic acids, which make it possible to deplete target proteins that are intractable to 
conventional drug modalities. We have developed a novel form of nucleic acid therapeutics, termed 
Brushield™ conjugate, which substantially enhances the antitumor activity of antisense oligonucleotides
by elevating in vivo stability, accelerating cellular uptake, and improving plasma pharmacokinetics and 
tumor accumulation, allowing for a much lower dosage to be used compared to conventional methods. 
The conjugate also suppresses nearly all side effects associated with traditional nucleic acid drugs by 
reducing unwanted nucleic acid-protein interactions. The goal of this proposal is to lay the groundwork 
for translating the technology towards the clinic. In Phase I, we will optimize the structure of the 
Brushield™ conjugate, and enhance current indication using a panel of non-small cell lung cells and 
mouse xenograft models. Upon reaching set quantitative milestones, we will subject the conjugate to 
more relevant animal models (orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models), and perform tolerability
and pharmacokinetic studies in mice and monkeys (Phase II). These studies will allow us to pursue an 
IND filing at the end of the project."
10885215,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) represent a significant challenge to basic scientists studying the 
molecular underpinnings of the disease and to patients and clinicians who deal directly with this most deadly and 
therapy-resistant of breast cancers. Presently, targeted approaches toward the treatment of TNBC are lacking. 
This project directly addresses this critical unmet need. We have developed VDX-111, a novel drug that exerts 
potent pro-apoptotic action in TNBC cell lines but, interestingly, has little or no effect on the majority of nonTNBC and non-tumorigenic breast cells. In vivo, VDX-111 reduces tumor xenograft growth from TNBC cell lines 
and a TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. To elucidate the mechanism of VDX-111action, we carried 
out a genome-wide shRNA functional genomics screen designed to identify genes required for VDX-111 action
in TNBC and provide insight into potential resistance mechanisms. The highest-ranking hit from this screen was 
the gene, PTP4A3, encoding the oncogenic phosphatase, PRL-3. To evaluate the clinical significance of PRL-3 
in TNBC, we probed the TCGA database. PRL-3 is amplified in approximately 50% of invasive TNBCs. We
validated PRL-3 as a target of VDX-111. Knockdown of PRL-3 significantly impaired the ability of VDX-111 to 
induce apoptosis. VDX-111 directly blocked the catalytic activity of purified PRL-3 and promotes the degradation 
of PRL-3. VDX-111 inhibited PRL-3-dependent TNBC cell migration and invasion. These findings indicate that
PRL-3 is a major target for VDX-111 in TNBC and is potentially a predictive biomarker for response to VDX-111.
In TNBC cells, VDX-111 synergizes with standard of care drugs frequently administered to TNBC patients,
highlighting its potential as a combinatorial therapeutic agent that could bolster efficacy while reducing the doses 
of the chemotherapeutics. In Phase I we will extend our in vitro proof of concept studies of VDX-111 in 
combination with doxorubicin and paclitaxel in murine TNBC PDX tumor models. To develop the 
commercialization potential of VDX-111, with the ultimate goal of moving it into clinical trials, IND-enabling 
studies are proposed. In Phase II we will (i) complete development and validation of bioanalytical methods for 
clinical testing and (ii), complete IND-enabling safety, toxicity, and PK/PD testing in two species. Phase II studies
will position us for subsequent IND approval and the initiation of human trials. Moreover, accomplishing the 
proposed Phase II goals will empower the commercialization and investment required to bring VDX-111 to the 
clinic for use in TNBC. The expected outcomes of these studies will enable optimization of VDX-111 for improved 
therapeutic options for TNBC patients and determine the safety and PK/PD parameters required for a pre-IND 
meeting with the FDA. These outcomes will establish an attractive investment opportunity to acquire the support 
needed to make VDX-111 an integral part of standard of care for patients with TNBC."

Cancer has killed over 600,000 people in US in 2020. The cost for healthcare and society is unbearable: because 
of cancer, $180B healthcare expenditure and $134B lost productivity are recorded every year. This is happening 
despite recent advancements in therapy and the emergence of an ever expanding array of new therapeutics for 
the over 1.8M new cancer patients every year. Indeed, because of the multitude and redundancy of mechanisms 
contributing to cancer growth, therapies are often ineffective. Several components should be targeted at the 
same time in order to maximize therapy outcome. However, this is particular hard to attain because of 1) the 
striking variability among cancers and the limited number of cancer specific targets 2) the ability of cancer cells 
to orchestrate a microenvironment of healthy tissue and cells around them, that promote cancer growth and 
therapy resistance. Boston Immune Technologies and Therapeutics (BITT) is developing BITT-1492, able to 
target both cancer cells and their microenvironment. BITT-1492 is an antagonist antibody against TNFR2 – a 
receptor highly expressed in cancer tissue and immune suppressive cells in the microenvironment, where it 
mediates pro-survival signaling. Thanks to BITT’s proprietary antibody design platform, BITT-1492 is the first 
and only antibody able to dominantly shut down TNFR2 signaling. Due to selective expression and key role of 
TNFR2 for a variety of cancers and tumor microenvironment cells, BITT-1492 will find application in the therapy 
of several cancers, starting with Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL), where TNFR2 is known to act as an 
extremely potent oncogene. BITT has already completed extensive pre-clinical validation for BITT-1492, 
demonstrating potent activity in CTCL, colon and ovarian cancers. In the proposed Fast-Track project, BITT will 
complete a pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacology assessment of BITT-1492 to obtain relevant data for an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application. This will be accomplished by performing, in line with ICH guidelines, 
an exploratory small-scale toxicology study to be carried out in Phase I, that will demonstrate the safety of use 
of BITT-1492 for a wider IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in Phase II. As part of the PhaseII 
BITT will also test the suitability of BITT-1492 production process for cGMP standard compliance. At the end of 
the SBIR project, BITT will be ready to advance BITT-1492 to clinical testing for which a combination of Venture 
Capital seed funds and SBIR PhaseIIb are expected to be leveraged. The successful completion of this project 
and initial clinical testing evidence will help to secure the already expressed interest of pharmaceutical 
companies with whom BITT will engage to complete late-stage clinical testing and launch BITT-1492 into 
international markets."

10922122,"Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a serious condition of low cardiac output with a 40-50% mortality. In severe CS,
hypoperfusion causes multi-organ failure and high left ventricle (LV) preload/wall stress exacerbates cardiac
injury/prevents recovery. Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is needed to restore perfusion and
unload the LV, bridging the CS patient to recovery, long-term LV assist device (LVAD), or heart transplant.
Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is most often used in severe CS, but it fails to unload LV
in > 50% of these patients with no improved outcomes. Minimally invasive, percutaneous MCS devices also do
not improve severe CS outcomes since they do not completely restore the circulation. Non-percutaneous MCS
devices provide total support but require open chest surgery and are not ambulation friendly. Impella 5.5 has
become the preferred MCS device for CS. Yet, patients with an Impella 5.5 must stay in ICU with very limited
ambulation. Thus, a big market gap exists for an ideal temporary MCS device that: 1) is minimally invasive, 2)
provides total LV support, and 3) enables easy ambulation. Our goal is to develop a new temporary MCS
system that provides total LV support via a minimally invasive technique with easy ambulation, enabling patient
discharge for at-home MCS. Our device will provide one month MCS (potential for up to 3 months) to bridge
severe CS patient to further treatment, recovery, durable VAD, or heart transplant. Our enabling technology
is a single port, pulsatile ventricular assist device (sppVAD) system that includes valved single lumen cannula
(VSLC), valveless single port diaphragm displacement pump (spDDP), and compact/portable console. Our
sppVAD system has following novel design:1) One VSLC for withdrawal and infusion; 2) single lumen design
doubles usable area to reduce circuit blood resistance for >6 L/min pumping; 3) One transapical to aorta
cannulation for minimally invasive installation; 4) Only one port reduces pump size for easy ambulation; 5)
Simple valveless pump geometry for better durability and 1-month MCS. In the Phase I SBIR, our sppVAD
system achieved >6 L/min pulsatile flow in bench test and 6 hr total LV unloading in sheep. Specific Aim 1:
Optimize and fabricate VSLC, valveless spDDP, and compact/portable console for the sppVAD system.
The VSLC will be made of reinforced polyurethane (PU). Inlet valves will be in LV for blood withdrawal. A tri-
leaflet outlet valve on VSLC tip will be in aorta for blood delivery. The spDDP will be made of polycarbonate
with a PU diaphragm. A compact/portable console will also be developed. Specific Aim 2: Bench test the
sppVAD system for performance, durability, and hemocompatibility. The sppVAD system will be tested in
mock loop for performance/durability and in an in vitro loop with bovine blood to quantify hemolysis. Specific
Aim 3: Perform 4-week preclinical testing of sppVAD system in sheep. A near commercial quality sppVAD
system will be tested in sheep (n=10) for safety/biocompatibility/reliability. Our novel sppVAD system fills a
large unmet need for ambulatory, at-home temporary total LV support to improve patient outcomes."
10918651,"TARGETING SIGNALING BETWEEN GLIOBLASTOMA AND THE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE NICHE
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and proliferative primary brain tumor in adults. It remains a
therapeutic challenge despite current treatment strategies that include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
Due to the tumor's high invasiveness, complete surgical resection is often impossible, leading to an almost
100% recurrence rate. Brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC), a subpopulation of undifferentiated cells within GBM,
are responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance, exhibiting self-renewing and pluripotent properties in vivo,
similar to those of Neural Progenitor Cells (NPC). Recent studies by our group and others have demonstrated
that GBMs located in proximity to the lateral ventricles (LV) exhibit multiple factors that negatively impact
patient survival, including increased proliferation and recurrence at distant locations. The underlying reasons
for these worse outcomes in LV-proximal GBMs are not well understood but may involve the influence
of the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche in the LV. Leveraging a GBM animal model that
recapitulates the effects of LV-proximity on tumor malignancy, we have observed that neural progenitor cells
(NPC) increase the proliferation and migration capacity of GBM-derived BTIC. Additionally, using image-guided
biopsies of brain tumor samples in patients, we have identified intratumoral transcriptional differences induced
by LV-proximity. Thus, we propose to investigate the specific protein components that drive the increased
malignancy of LV-proximal tumors, utilizing novel cell-specific proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. The
completion of this study will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction between
brain tumors and the neurogenic niche in the SVZ. Ultimately, our findings will identify novel therapeutic targets
to improve the survival of patients with GBM."
10920288,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Frontotemporal dementia, often classified as Alzheimer’s disease related dementia, is a devastating disease
with a common onset between the ages of 40 to 65 that affects estimated >50,000 people just in the US. The
disease is a result of progressive degeneration of frontal and temporal lobes of the brain that can result in wide
variety of devastating symptoms including severe behavioral changes, speech and language problems, motor
disorders, and survival of 3-12 years, but no therapies slowing the progression of this age-related
neurodegenerative disease are available.
 We propose undertaking a project to rapidly discover a novel oligonucleotide therapeutic for direct modulation
of a genetically validated target involved in pathologic neuroinflammation. Microglia-driven neuroinflammation
has emerged as a critical pathologic mechanism in FTD and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases. We
found that our target expression level is significantly increased in FTD-ALS, which is the most severe version of
FTD. Consistently with published literature from other neurodegenerative diseases, we find that the lower
expression of the genetic target is correlated with longer patient survival, and its hypomorphic gene variant is
associated with late disease onset. This project leverages our high-throughput iPSC platform with diverse genetic
models of FTD to provide robust functional evidence for further development of the candidate drug.
 Successful completion of the proposed drug discovery project will deliver a candidate therapeutic for FTD
that will be ready for in vivo studies. The mission of our company is to efficiently deliver novel therapeutics to
patients with devastating age-related diseases using our lean company model and high-throughput, automated
drug discovery platform anchored in human genomic data paired with clinical measurements."
10918728,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project seeks to develop a novel disease-modifying compound for AD (AD) by targeting the underlying
mechanism of synapse loss. Synapse loss is tightly correlated with cognitive decline and is triggered initially by
amyloid-β peptide oligomer accumulation. Soluble amyloid-β oligomers bind to Prion Protein, thereby engaging
mGluR5 as a co-receptor, and activating PTK2B (Pyk2) and Fyn kinases to couple with Tau pathology and
synapse loss. Genetic knockout studies in rodents have shown that knockout of mGluR5 prevents disease onset,
and our target sits directly upstream of PTK2B, a GWAS hit in AD. These features provide strong evidence of
mGluR5 as a promising therapeutic target for developing novel Alzheimer’s treatments.
Allyx Therapeutics has obtained an exclusive license for use of BMS-984923 in neurodegenerative diseases
from Bristol Meyers Squibb and Yale University. Preliminary studies demonstrate robust efficacy of this small
molecule treatment in multiple preclinical mouse AD models. Drug treatment recovers synapse density, restores
hippocampal activity, and returns memory performance to normal levels. Pre-clinical development has
characterized a highly drug-like profile allowing for the recent approval of the BMS-984923 commercial IND for
the initiation of first time in human clinical studies. Phase 1 clinical studies demonstrate a robust safety profile
and complete receptor occupancy at low doses indicating a favorable drug profile for advancement into Phase
2 proof of concept studies. The overall goal is to develop disease-modifying oral drug effective to slow, halt or
partially reverse AD progression both in the MCI state and in mild dementia."
10918729,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the maternal
UBE3A and characterized by severe developmental delay. Current treatment only helps manage
symptoms and cannot meet clinical need to effectively treat AS. The expression of Ube3a in
neurons can be activated through inhibition of non-coding antisense RNA of UBE3A (UBE3A-
ATS). Genome editing strategy targeting UBE3A-ATS is a promising therapeutic approach for AS.
AAV is the most widely used vector for genome editing. However, AAV presents potential safety
concerns of immunogenicity and off-target effects. Thus, there is a clear unmet need for novel
nonviral delivery technologies for safe and efficient delivery of the CRISPR machinery to neurons
for AS treatment. In this application, Couragene proposes to develop a novel, chemically modified
ribonucleoprotein (cRNP) complexed with Cas9 protein and gRNA for delivery of CRISPR
mediated gene editing to the brain for treatment of AS. cRNPs have been previously shown to
enable brain-wide genome editing and achieve long-term persistent therapeutic benefits in AS
mice through single intrathecal (IT) administration. The proposed project will focus on formulation
optimization of the cRNP for delivery of genome editing to neuronal cells in vitro in Aim 1, seeking
to achieve over 70% editing efficiency in primary AS neuronal cells. The leading cRNP formulation
will then be characterized in Aim 2 to determine cRNP-based genome editing delivery efficiency
and safety in Ube3a-YFP AS reporter mice. We aim to achieve brain-wide genome editing with
over 50% neuronal editing efficiency without significant toxicity through single intrathecal injection
in AS mouse. The successful completion of the proposed work will build a solid foundation for
Phase II projects where further biodistribution and phenotypic rescue evaluation in Ube3a
maternal deficiency mice, off-target study and IND-enabling studies with potential partners will
take place. The projects will eventually result in a nonviral genome editing therapy with
Couragene’s innovative chemically modified ribonucleoprotein cRNP technology, greatly
enhancing the clinical treatment for patients with AS."

10921058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 HIV is a chronic infection requiring long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) to halt viral replication and
prevent disease progression. Despite highly effective ART, issues remain with medication access, adherence,
and tolerability. When ART is stopped, the virus rebounds from a reservoir of long-lived infected cells with
resumption of disease progression. Exceptions to this natural disease course are “Elite Controllers” who
spontaneously suppress viral replication by highly functional HIV-specific T-cells. To achieve the robust immune
responses observed in Elite Controllers, we have generated HIV-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CD4CAR)
T cells that redirect the specificity of T cells to recognize highly conserved regions of HIV. Using our validated
non-human primate (NHP) model of chronic HIV infection, we have shown that CD4CAR T cells induce long-
term viral remission following ART interruption in a subset of NHPs. Our data suggest that long-term CD4CAR
T-cell responses will be essential to advance this therapy broadly for people living with HIV (PLWH).
 We are currently investigating strategies to extend CD4CAR T-cell persistence in vivo. Unlike in cancer,
CAR T cells for HIV must overcome abundant soluble antigen in the form of circulating virus. Our preliminary
data highlight how soluble antigen can inhibit CD4CAR T-cell killing of target cells and promote a dysfunctional
immunophenotype. We hypothesize that soluble antigen must be overcome to achieve comparable success as
observed for cancer. In this proposal, we will thoroughly characterize and overcome the effect of soluble antigen
on CD4CAR T-cell function using our new ex vivo models of viremia to validate next-generation CD4CAR
constructs. We will also extend the persistence of CD4CAR T cells using the immunostimulatory IL15 cytokine,
which can boost HIV-specific endogenous T-cell and cancer-specific CAR T-cell responses. Our preliminary data
confirm the potential for IL15 to enhance the cytotoxicity and survival of CD4CAR T cells. In this proposal, we
will compare a series of IL15-armored CD4CAR T-cell strategies to enhance long-term persistence and durable
cytotoxicity. Finally, we will combine our strategies to generate potent armored CD4CAR T cells with improved
function and persistence during viremia, which we will validate and test in our NHP model of chronic HIV infection.
 Through the mentored research experiences outlined in this K08 proposal, Dr. Bui will develop expertise
in gene therapy and adoptive cellular therapies for the treatment of HIV, which is aligned with his future career
goal to become an independent physician-scientist advancing immunotherapies for infectious diseases. The

10923999,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In eukaryotes, ribonucleotides are frequently incorporated into DNA during replication (1 ribonucleotide per every
1000-5000 deoxyribonucleotides). Canonically, RNase H2 is the protein responsible for the removal of these
embedded ribonucleotides. However, it has been recently shown that topoisomerase 1 (Top1) also has its own
genomic ribonucleotide processing activity. When this processing occurs in specific short repeat sequences, it
can lead to 2-7 bp deletions. These deletions are the result of two sequential nicks by Top1 that releases a small
single-stranded DNA segment and is then followed by a strand slippage and ligation across the formed gap.
These deletions have been shown to be biased towards the non-transcribed strand (NTS) of highly transcribed
genes, but the reasoning for this strand specificity is yet to be elucidated. With the help of our recent preliminary
data, we propose that this strand specificity for Top1 activity is due to the formation of DNA topological structures,
specifically negative supercoils, behind the RNA polymerase that bias the initial cleavage by Top1. This would
re-define the way we think about Top1-mediated DNA relaxation by limiting the cleavage of Top1 mainly towards
the NTS during transcription. This limitation also allowed us to hypothesize about a possible biological implication
for Top1-catalyzed excision of ribonucleotides. When Top1 cleaves a ribonucleotide, it can generate a unique
nick lesion known as 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate (CP). The bias of Top1 cleavage at the NTS and the formation of
CPs lead us to hypothesize that this transient nick lesion could serve as a way of continually relieving
transcriptional torsional stress, as CPs would be forming at a strand that would potentially not interfere with
transcription, unlike nicks at the transcribing strand. We plan to investigate this by looking at mRNA expression
after depleting genomic ribonucleotides in yeast. This investigation will provide us with potential roles of
ribonucleotide incorporation in eukaryotes. Additionally, the processing of genomic ribonucleotides by Top1
produces PARP-trapping lesions, a chemotherapeutic target for BRCA1/BRCA2 deficient tumors. I will look at
the interactions that could lead to the trapping of PARP1 after ribonucleotide cleavage by Top1 and its link to the
ability of PARP1 to regulate CP formation (identified recently by us and shown in our preliminary data). The
presence of either CPs or adducts between DNA and Top1 are likely candidates for the recruitment of PARP1.
Overall, our findings will help clarify the relevance of ribonucleotide incorporation for transcriptional regulation by
providing insight into a novel mechanism of DNA relaxation by Top1 through the processing of those genomic
ribonucleotides. Our proposal will also aim to describe the regulation of CP formation by PARP1, and the
physiological relevance of the interaction between Top1, PARP1, and genomic ribonucleotides."
10932396,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The innermost compartments of the testes’ seminiferous tubules are shielded from the general circulation by
the molecular and cellular anatomy of Sertoli cells that form a highly effective blood-tissue barrier. The BTB
presents a hurdle to scientific efforts aimed at developing male-directed contraceptives or fertility-enhancing
therapeutics that target developing sperm cells uniquely locatedwithin the “adluminal” compartment of
seminiferous tubules. Additionally, the adluminal compartment of seminiferous tubules is an “immune
privileged site”, providing a safe harbor where pathogens escape both host immunity and anti-pathogenic
therapeutics. Thus, developing this specialized tool will provide unique resources needed for institutions to
improve the effectiveness of drugs targeting a broad spectrum of human health issues.
Our central hypothesis is based on the premise that novel methods for sampling tissues and fluids located
behind the BTB will be of great benefit to de-risk drug discovery programs focused on developing therapeutics
directed at viral diseases, cancer, parasites and contraception. Our long-term research goals are to expedite
the development of pharmaceuticals that will be effective against targets located within the adluminal
compartment of the testes. Our objective for the R61 phase of this project is to develop and validate
procedures by which we can sample and analyze fluid from the rat’s rete testis, behind its BTB. Sampling fluid
from behind the rat BTB will allow researchers to verify how effectively their test drugs are able to cross the
BTB and interact with targets located in the testes’ pharmacologically privileged sites. Furthermore, we will
identify and validate molecular reference standards that will be used to compare relative abilities of test
compounds to cross the BTB. Finally, we will determine the feasibility of adapting the rat procedure to a mouse
system. Our objective for the R33 phase of this project is to identify unique chemical structures and/or
scaffolds that will penetrate the BTB and to also establish and validate a robust sampling method in the mouse
since it is the predominant species used for efficacy models ranging from fertility/contraception, infectious
disease and cancer. Although similar in structure and function, rat and mouse BTB can differ significantly in a
host of factors such as transporter and macromolecule composition."

Delirium, a major cause of falls, can occur in as many as 50% of cancer patients undergoing stem cell 
transplantation, resulting in up to 14 times greater chance of dying. Delirium risk can be mitigated and many 
other outcomes of stem cell transplants can be improved through behavioral interventions delivered at the 
bedside through conversation, imagery, and audio. However, traditional means of delivering these 
interventions are very labor intensive, difficult to quality control, and difficult to cost-effectively scale to many 
patients. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop a technology-enabled bedside digital relational 
agent specifically programmed to enhance the well-being, safety, and outcomes of cancer patients undergoing 
inpatient stem cell transplantation, by supporting them through protocols in the following eight categories: Diet 
& Hydration, Physical Exercise, Incentive Spirometry, Orientation, Non-Pharmacological Pain & Anxiety 
Management, Psychosocial Support & Staff Communication, Sleep, and Toileting Assistance. We will then 
conduct a three-year clinical study, deploying this new intervention to over 200 adult patients across two 
oncology/hematology units, aiming to observe (compared to a randomized control group) statistically significant 
reductions in length of stay, incident delirium rate, fall rate, anxiety, depression, and loneliness, with improved 
overall patient satisfaction and rate of immune system recovery post-transplant. This proposal addresses the 
major National Cancer Institute portfolio areas of “Technologies for Cancer Control (Behavioral Health 
Interventions)” and “Digital Health (Mobile Health and Health Information Technology).”"

10923319,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Depression and anxiety are associated with alterations in brain networks supporting emotion processing and
regulation, including attention (dorsal attention [DAN], ventral attention [VAN]), arousal and focus (cingulo-
opercular [CON], saliency [SAL]), and self-regulation (default [DMN], frontoparietal [FPN]) networks. These
networks undergo substantial development during the preschool years, a critical stage for developing self-
regulation. Developing self-regulation involves learning how to distinguish specific negative emotions (e.g.,
sadness, fear, and anger). How caregivers react when their child expresses negative affect theoretically
shapes how the neural representations of negative emotions develop, however this has not been formally
tested. Further, a separate body of work shows that increased negative affect during the preschool period is a
risk factor for later depression and anxiety. Together, this suggests a reinforcement model linking these two
risk factors: increased expression of negative affect in the child elicits a caregiver response, which either
scaffolds emotion learning or not. If the caregiving response is consistently negative, this results in the brain
failing to develop separable concepts for distinct emotion categories, resulting in increased distress when
faced with these emotions in the future. The principal goal of this study is to test this reinforcement model
of how negative affect and caregiving interact to alter brain and emotional development, conferring
risk for depression and anxiety. In Aim 1, I will characterize emotion processing development (activation
and gaze to negative emotions) across the preschool period. In Aim 2, I will fit a reinforcement learning model,
testing negative caregiving as a moderator of developing distinct negative emotion concepts. Finally in Aim 3, I
will test if frequency of negative affect expression influences these associations. The department of Psychiatry
is highly supportive of my transition to faculty and has offered a faculty position—Assistant Professor on the
Investigator (tenure) Track—that is not contingent on the receipt of the DP5 grant and with 95% of my effort
dedicated to research and a startup package tailored to my needs. I am also more than prepared for early
independence. I have spent my entire research career independently studying the neurobiological etiology of

 In case of radiation accidents or nuclear warfare, exposure of the small intestine and colon to high-dose
irradiation results in delayed injury, manifested by an increase in fibrosis, that significantly impacts organ
function. There are no current FDA-approved medical countermeasures to prevent, mitigate, or treat delayed
radiation injury of the small intestine and colon. However, one major challenge for the development of such
therapies is to understand how fibrosis associated with DEARE (Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure)
is impacted by biological sex, as recent studies suggest that females may be more sensitive to delayed
radiation-induced fibrosis compared to males. Our long-term goal is to uncover the mechanisms underlying the
effects of biological sex on acute and long-term radiation injury of the GI tract. Type I IFN has been proposed
as a potential mitigator of acute radiation injury to the intestine by promoting epithelial regeneration.
Furthermore, Type I IFN is activated in the intestine and colon following acute radiation injury and is
persistently upregulated in our model of DEARE. In preliminary studies, we evaluated radiation-induced
delayed colonic fibrosis in male and female Irgm1-/- mice that are known to potently activate Type I IFN and
found that germline Irgm1 deletion results in substantially greater colonic fibrosis in females compared to
males. Therefore, in this application, we hypothesize that Type I Interferon signaling, while preventing acute
radiation injury to the GI tract, promotes long-term intestinal fibrosis to a greater degree in females vs. males.
We will test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the molecular
mechanisms of sex-dependent, Type I Interferon signaling in radiation-induced fibrosis. Aim 2: To determine
the cellular origins of sex-dependent, radiation-induced fibrosis. Aim 3: To determine the efficacy of FDA
approved Type I Interferon inhibitors to prevent the development of radiation-induced intestinal fibrosis in
females vs. males. Together, these studies will reveal novel mechanisms by which activation of Type I
Interferon promotes the development of chronic submucosal fibrosis in the gastrointestinal tract in sex-
dependent manner, which is a major complication of survival from gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome
(GI-ARS). These results will inform the future development of mitigators of DEARE in female and male
populations."

Flow Cytometry, Mass Cytometry, Cell Sorting, and Imaging are essential tools for a wide range of methodologies
aimed at understanding complex single cell proteomic and genomic cancer research. The instrumentation
involved is large, complex, and can be difficult to maintain and operate. As such, a targeted core facility is critical
for a Comprehensive Cancer Center such as MD Anderson. The FCCIF, est. 1982, provides these services.
Since the last CCSG renewal (2012) 404 cancer center members from all 16 cancer center programs have used
the facility and produced 604 publications. Many of the hot topics in cancer biology currently stem from immune
cell interaction with the tumor cell; immunephenotyping is an in demand field of research that requiring a unique
high plex assay. This requires a specialized imaging or cytometry approach and the FCCIF has specifically
acquired two different platforms because of their diversity and flexibility. These platforms are the Vectra
Multispectral imaging system and the CyTOF (suspension and imaging) Mass Cytometers. The FCCIF provides
a common source of state-of-the-art expertise and technical skills to support the varied research efforts of MD
Anderson investigators. The FCCIF provides a comprehensive service to all of the institutional investigators
regardless of prior expertise. Dr. Jared K. Burks (author of this R50, co-Director of the FCCIF-NC) provides
critical services including: 1) education, 2) consultation on needed technological approach, 3) training on
equipment use, analytics, and proper experimental design. I identify and acquire novel technologies for use by
MDACC investigators and I provide support in a manner to ensure success and mitigate pitfalls. I am expected
to develop new strategies and technologies to meet the research needs of our faculty. A few examples of what
I have currently been working on is the Vectra Polaris Multispectral Microscope, Helios and Hyperion Suspension
and Imaging CyTOFs. The Polaris has operated on average 13.5 hours per day for the last year. The CyTOFs
are reporting 5090% growth since the last CCSG renewal. These results stem from mitigating the pitfalls, making
the technologies approachable and affordable, and supporting the researchers throughout the process all the
way to publication. Collaborations, both academic and industry, have resulted to develop or test novel
applications. The models we have created to support these technologies have and will continue to be shared
with others operating the technologies. We are highly involved with both developing and standardizing new
technologies for use at MD Anderson and with our facilities and researchers implementing them worldwide."
10923832,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to address a fundamental gap in knowledge on how phagophores are closed to form
double membrane autophagosomes. During macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy), crescent-shaped
phagophores elongate around cytoplasmic material and seal to generate double-membrane autophagosomes
that fuse with lysosomes for cargo degradation. As the phagophore rim narrows, the membranes must undergo
fission to separate the inner and outer membranes in a process that bears resemblance to endosomal sorting
complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-mediated membrane scission. Using our elegant HaloTag-LC3
autophagosome completion assay, we provided the first experimental evidence for the ESCRT machinery in
mammalian phagophore closure and identified the ESCRT-I subunit VPS37A as critical factor for the
recruitment of downstream ESCRTs to the phagophore. Notably, we found that the N-terminal putative
ubiquitin E2 variant (PUEV) domain of VPS37A is uniquely required for autophagosome closure but is
dispensable for other ESCRT-mediated membrane abscission processes, including endosome receptor sorting
and cytokinesis. Compartment-specific targeting factors initiate the sequential recruitment of the four ESCRT
complexes (ESCRT-I, -II, -III and VPS4) to the membrane scission site. While the phagophore-specific
targeting factors for the VPS37A-containing ESCRT-I complex are unknown, our preliminary study has
revealed that VPS37A PUEV interacts with highly curved membranes containing anionic lipids and lipid
packing defects, which are all features of the phagophore rim. We hypothesize that the PUEV selectively
interacts with highly curved phagophore membranes to target ESCRT-I to the phagophore. Furthermore, our
preliminary work has revealed that ESCRT recruitment to phagophores requires protein ubiquitylation and the
LC3/GABARAP conjugation machinery, leading us to believe that the stabilization of membrane-associated
ESCRT-I requires additional interactions with phagophore-associated ubiquitylated cargo. We are in an ideal
position to test our hypotheses in the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine how VPS37A targets ESCRT-I
to phagophores and directs the assembly of downstream ESCRTs during autophagosome biogenesis; (2) to
identify phagophore-specific targeting factors for ESCRT-I during autophagy. As autophagy is involved in
numerous physiological and pathological processes, these studies will have far-reaching implications for
human health and disease."

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are the second most common malignancy of the pancreas, with an
overall survival of 3.6 years and successful surgery the only treatment offering potential for cure. However,
around 40-95% of pNETs are metastatic at the time of initial diagnosis, with local recurrence within the
resection bed as the norm. Furthermore, patients with liver metastases from pNETs often have debilitating
symptoms such as uncontrollable diarrhea, flushing, skin rashes, and heart failure. There are few systemic
therapies that have proven to be clinically useful, and those that have still bear widely variable response rates
and have poor side effect profiles. The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of Notch2 in the
proliferation, metastasis, and hormone-secreting phenotype of NETs, and evaluate Notch2 as a
predictor of patient outcomes. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that overexpression of Notch2 results
in an increase of the proliferative rate of NET cells, while decreasing their hormone secretion. Our data also
suggest that Notch2 is upregulated in metastatic pNETs compared to primary tumors. Seminal data from one
of the largest genomic studies to date on pNETs has also identified Notch2 as a key master-regulator of pNET
metastasis, representing a key convergence of dependencies required for disease progression and the
establishment of metastasis. Therefore, it is my hypothesis that Notch2 functions in an oncogenic role in
NETs and drives tumor progression, resulting in a more aggressive phenotype and portending worse
patient prognosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will conduct phenotypic characterization (proliferation,
hormone production, migration) on Notch2-overexpressing pNET cell lines that have been transiently and
stably transfected. We will similarly evaluate pNET cell lines with Notch2 knockdown via siRNA, as well as
stable knockout pNET cell lines generated using CRISPR-Cas9. We will then conduct similar studies in vivo
using a liver metastasis mouse model whereby Notch2-overexpressing and Notch2 pNET cell lines are injected
into athymic mice. Using this model, we will evaluate tumor growth and metastasis via microCT, in addition to
hormone secretion over a 16-week period. We will then conduct endpoint analysis of tumors and mouse
organs. Lastly, we will immunohistochemically analyze the expression of Notch2 using pNET tissue
microarrays derived from human patients that have undergone surgical resection at the University of Alabama
at Birmingham and evaluate the relationships between the expression of Notch2, Notch2 pathway
components, and various patient outcome measures. This study will yield valuable information on the effects of
Notch2 in pNETs that can help to guide future targeted therapeutic efforts and inform an understanding of
pNET biology."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) are unrivaled in their lethality. PDAs have the highest 1-
year, 5-year, and 10-year mortalities of any cancer and are expected to become the second-leading
cause of cancer-related death by 2030. An invasive PDA represents the coordinated evolution of cell-
intrinsic and extrinsic processes and capabilities that subvert and repurpose the dictums of normal
tissue composition, architecture, and physiology to foster unbridled growth and colonization. This new
organizational entity is constructed largely at the behest of the mutated epithelial cell. The resulting
PDA neo-organ contains a minority of tumor epithelial cells amidst a heterogeneous sea of non-
epithelial cells; a complex interstitial stew of proteins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, together
with both freely mobile and complexed water; and a paucity of vessels that otherwise resemble a
normal vasculature in lacking fenestrae or interendothelial junctions, but that are collapsed under
intense interstitial pressures. We have undertaken a systematic exploration of the cell autonomous and
non-cell autonomous processes that drive PDA pathogenesis and resistance. We have developed
genetically engineered animal models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical syndrome, metastatic
behavior, histopathology and molecular features of the human disease as primary platforms to both
uncover critical principles of disease biology and to rigorously test strategies to overcome them.
Through such investigations we have identified unusually high concentrations of intratumoral
hyaluronan (HA) as the primary culprit in the extraordinarily elevated interstitial pressures in PDA that,
in turn, cause the vascular collapse and hypoperfusion characteristic of this disease. The stromal
barrier to perfusion also serves as a primary mechanism of drug resistance in limiting the penetration of
systemically delivered agents. We have additionally identified multiple mechanisms of immune
suppression that prevent the development of an endogenous effector T cell response. Collectively,
these unique aspects of stromal biology in PDA conspire to create a drug- and immune-privileged
sanctuary for unimpeded growth of the pancreas cancer cell. Very recently, we have elaborated
strategies to overcome critical aspects of these physical and immunological barriers to therapy
revealing a perhaps unexpected degree of vulnerability once the barriers are breached. We describe a
series of continuing investigations into this overarching strategy of stromal re-engineering to build upon
the significant inroads made – and the important lessons learned – in the hopes of radically
transforming the approach and prognosis for this formidable disease."
10923876,"Project Summary
 The goal of this project is to determine how ciliopathy-related mutations contribute to ciliary
pathophysiology. Ciliopathies are disorders rooted in ciliary dysfunction and exhibit overlapping clinical
features, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, polydactyly, retinal dystrophy, and progressive
involvement of the kidney and liver. While individually rare, ciliopathies combined affect 1/500 individuals and
each of the ~30 distinct ciliopathies is caused by dysfunction of a specific protein network related to the cilium,
although the precise cellular mechanisms remain elusive. The primary cilium is an antenna-like projection
found on nearly every cell; it extends from the cell body, where it receives and interprets signals, thus allowing
cells to respond to their environment. Cilia are partitioned from the cellular cytoplasm by the transition zone
that regulates protein trafficking. A dedicated active transport system, intraflagellar transport, moves proteins
bound for the cilium across this barrier and works in conjunction with multiple methods for protein retention and
selective egress. The proteins involved in this selective protein transport are implicated in a range of
ciliopathies, indicating that aberrant ciliary protein content likely contributes to the etiology of these disorders.
 I will use my novel human cilia isolation protocol and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry approach to
assess global ciliary protein composition, defining differences between controls and cells harboring ciliopathy-
associated hypomorphic mutations. This work will provide a comprehensive, unbiased catalog of mislocalized
proteins in Joubert (K99) and Bardet-Biedl (R00) syndromes, thus providing a rich resource for future work to
dissect the protein networks involved in ciliopathies. In a complementary approach, I will determine how
ciliopathy-associated mutations affect the dynamics of protein trafficking by endogenously tagging key
ciliopathy proteins and following their movement using live-cell microscopy. This work will answer critical
questions about the impact of ciliopathy-associated mutations on entry into, retention within, and exit from cilia.
This application proposes innovative techniques that are easily extendable to other proteins/ciliopathies, and
importantly, investigates protein content and dynamics in the human disease context rather than with null
mutations in animal models. Together, this work will shed light on the etiology of ciliopathies and catalyze the
development of future therapies."
10918789,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Although the detection of gene expression by quantitative PCR, bulk or single cell RNA sequencing represents
a cornerstone of biological inquiry, these approaches are limited in their ability to measure transcriptional
dynamics over time and throughout the spatial heterogeneity of tissues, and to detect low-abundance
transcripts including those from cytokines. Cytokine expression shapes the infiltration and activity of immune
cells in tumors and tissues and represents an important correlate of response to immunotherapy. However,
cytokine expression is context-dependent, pleiotropic, dynamic and asynchronous. As such, it is particularly
poorly suited to single ‘snapshot’ measurements in time, or the detection of a single or even a few
inflammatory mediators in isolation. To address these challenges, we will combine advances in CRISPR-
mediated transcriptional activation technology with genetically-encoded set reporting, to fluorescently report
the transcriptional activity of 9 or more cytokines simultaneously, dynamically and in situ in tissues. We have
previously validated the core capability of our system to report single gene expression in preliminary studies
and will now optimize its detection capabilities and implement a Cre-Lox-based randomized fluorescent
reporter set-encoding strategy to multiplex detection. If successful, our study will establish a novel approach to
multiplexed and high-sensitivity CRISPR-based detection of gene expression. It will also produce tools and
reagents that can be directly applied to interrogate the basis for tumor microenvironment inflammation and can
be adapted for functional genomic and in vivo studies."

The Wilmer Biostatistics Center (WBC) has been successful in providing study design and
analytic support to the Hopkins vision research community through its flexible structure that
combines the expertise of Wilmer biostatisticians and epidemiologists with consultants at
Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The WBC
has facilitated interdisciplinary collaboration across schools and across institutions through
funding that supports outside consultants. It has also promoted productivity by providing
statistical resources to faculty in a timely and cost-efficient manner. As our researchers become
more successful and expand their research portfolios, the WBC is committed to innovating to
provide more expansive sustainable services through innovative enhancements. The WBC web
presence is expanding to provide more visibility and accessibility, and harnessing web-based
assessment tools to refine capture of metrics of success – information that will help the WBC
grow and improve. The WBC is going beyond providing analytic services to train Wilmer
researchers to be savvy consumers of statistical output. The goal of the WBC is to grow and
adapt with Wilmer researchers to provide expert reliable analytic services and consulting as well
as push frontiers of research in Wilmer through education initiatives, collaboration facilitation,
methodological development and capacity building. In the current proposed funding period, the
center will 1) continue to provide expert and specialized biostatistics and epidemiology services

bioinformatics services to many research labs at Hopkins University Medical
School. In this funding cycle, we plan to continue to perform bioinformatics
analysis for the projects initiated by the researchers at Johns Hopkins, provide
educational bioinformatics course for PIs, postdocs and students, and support
the grant applications for the researchers. One new direction we plan to pursue is
single cell data analysis, since more and more labs at Hopkins are starting to
employ single cell sequencing for their projects. We will also provide
bioinformatics seminar series to give tutorials on basic bioinformatics analytic
tools, including single cell data analysis."
10925208,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The role of the Administrative Core is to help the OHSU Casey Eye Institute P30 Ophthalmology Core Facility
(1) provide support for NEI-funded investigators to help them achieve their current research goals, tap into new
experimental approaches and develop and successfully obtain ongoing funding; (2) take full advantage of the
broad, “bench to bedside” vision research infrastructure at OHSU by creating and strengthening collaborations
between basic, clinical and translational vision researchers; and (3) continue to support the academic
advancement of junior investigators as they pursue independent research careers. Four service cores will be
provided, three of which will be directed by co-PIs to provide a broader level of support and provide mid-career
investigators with experience in research administration. An Executive Committee consisting of overall PI John
Morrison and core PI’s will, with support from Casey administrators, establish allocation of resources, monitor
core access, productivity and budgeting and consider emerging research opportunities and technologies. This
committee will meet regularly twice a year but will maintain ongoing, informal communications. Executive
committee meetings will be attended by Brad Noren, Casey Grants Manager, and Nathan Lucia, Finance
Manager, to help provide input on grant regulatory and budgeting issues and avoid preventable lapses or cost
overruns. Support of junior investigators includes a Grants Mentorship Program instituted and run by Dr. Kate
Keller, co-PI of the Genetic Models of Ocular Disease and Biostatistics core. An Oversight Committee will consist
of Dr. Morrison, senior Casey leadership (Drs. Lauer, Chiang and Wilson) and two senior members of OHSU

Bone metastasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. It is closely linked to advanced
skeletal aging, which is driven by the accumulation of aged (senescent) cells that secrete proinflammatory
molecules. Pharmacologically delaying bone aging remains the most effective preventive strategy against bone
metastasis. Osteoporosis drugs effectively impede bone aging and metastasis, but their benefits are transient.
Senolytic drugs are a new class of drugs that have shown compelling preclinical evidence in delaying skeletal
aging. However, their clinical adoption has been slow due to the heterogeneous cellular senescence and tissue-
specific efficacy. This proposal aims to develop and validate demineralized bone paper (DBP)-based human
bone metabolic and senolytic assays that support bone-targeting drug discovery and treatment regimens.
 DBP is an osteoid-inspired thin slice of demineralized compact bone matrix that preserves the intrinsic
collagen structure of bone while remaining accessible for microscopic imaging. DBP can be produced in large
quantities and attach stably to tissue culture plastic. This feature effectively enables DBP to receive mechanical
stress transmitted via vibration. Attaching DBP in a standard 96-well plate provides a unique opportunity to
develop standardized, functional, and analytical human bone models and phenotypic assays.
 In Aim 1, we will develop humanized bone metabolic assays. We will humanize DBP-based bone models
with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and human CD14+ monocytes, mimicking bone
remodeling cycles. Next, we will create anabolic and catabolic assays using the models and validate with known
agents. Finally, we will test whether the models can recapitulate osteoporosis treatment outcomes using
Denosumab and Zoledronate.
 In Aim 2, we will develop humanized bone senolytic assays. We will first introduce pre-senescent osteoblasts
and co-culture with human CD14+ monocytes to create an aged bone model. Next, we will validate that senescent
models increase osteoclast differentiation and mineral resorption. We will then test a model senolytic drug
therapy (Dasatinib and Quercetin) to mitigate negative impacts. Finally, we will investigate whether vibrational
mechanoculture affects senolytic drug responses.
 The proposed DBP-based models will provide predictive bone assays for drug screening, which could
significantly impact the field by accelerating the identification of new anti-bone-aging drugs and improved
treatment strategies. Overall, this proposal is a significant contribution to the field of bone research and has the
potential to make a major impact on the lives of cancer survivors."

RestorEar Devices LLC aims to develop and test application of mild therapeutic hypothermia to mitigate noise-
induced hearing loss (NIHL). NIHL is global public health risk and is an impairment resulting from irreversible
damage caused to the sensitive structures and neural elements in the cochlea. A Center for Disease Control and
Prevention report highlights that 24% of adults and 17% of teenagers in the United States experience hearing loss
in one or both ears from exposure to occupational or recreational loud sound. NIHL has a high prevalence among
members of the armed forces and firefighters who are occupationally at-risk. Globally, occupational noise
exposure is responsible for 16% of disabling hearing loss (over 600 million people) with significant lifetime costs
per person in the US alone. Preliminary and prior published results show that controlled and localized therapeutic
hypothermia provided to the inner ear post-noise or surgical trauma conserves significant residual hearing and
preserves sensitive neural structures. Over the past 3 years, the University of Miami team has also shown noise-
induced changes in hearing and balance functions in at-risk groups of firefighters. With the prior Phase I SBIR
award, RestorEar Devices LLC designed, built and tested systems and protocols to deliver mild therapeutic
hypothermia non-invasively to the inner ear. We met all of the milestones outlined, including testing the efficacy
of our devices for human application using computational models of heat transfer and studies from cadaveric
temporal bones. We are now ready to translate one such device, ReBoundTM, to practice. This Phase II SBIR
proposal will test safety and efficacy of ReBound-delivered mild therapeutic hypothermia treatment in mitigating
noise-induced hearing loss in firefighters. In collaboration with the University of Miami and South Florida fire
services, we have designed a clinical study to test this therapy in occupationally at-risk firefighters. Subjective
and functional assessments repeated over time will enable evaluation of the protective effects of mild therapeutic
hypothermia following noise exposure. Considering that the prevalence of hearing loss is expected to increase
significantly in the next few decades, these human clinical studies will support establishing therapeutic
hypothermia for hearing protection."

The Pathology Core is responsible for overseeing the realm of human tissue, which is ultimately the life 
blood of the translational projects proposed in this DF/HCC Ovarian Spore application. The primary mission of 
the Pathology Core is to ground the projects in the visual realities of tissue cyto-morphology as the individual 
project directors explore new therapies and biomarkers of therapeutic response. The first aim of this core is to 
ensure that the projects are in compliance with IRB-approved protocols. The second aim will be to ensure 
access to the highest quality tissue. This task is multifaceted and entails close coordination between core 
investigators and personnel involved in consenting patients, delivering tissues to the Frozen Section room for 
allocation, and transporting the tissue to the proper destination. In this setting, quality of service pertains to 
both the condition of the tissue and the precision with which the tissue is analyzed to ensure that the proper 
cellular components are selected for study. The third aim for this core will be to provide expert histopathologic 
interpretation when needed and aid in experimental design and execution when tissue is utilized. All of these 
aims will be executed in the context of each individual project and other cores. In Project 1 the core will be 
involved in tissue allocation for sequencing, organoid or patient-derived xenograft generation, and paraffin 
embedding and sectioning. The core will aid in antibody optimization, immunohistochemical staining of tissue 
sections, and interpretation of results obtained on tissue in the context of multiple clinical trials. In Project 2, 
involving a vaccine trial, critical tasks will include allocation of fresh tissue for all activities surrounding vaccine 
generation and organoid generation as well as for generating paraffin embedded sections. The core will help to 
assess immune response at the tissue level through multi-plex immunofluorescence analysis to help maximize 
the information that can be gleaned. In Project 3, the core will aid with fresh, frozen, and fixed tissue 
acquisition and allocation to allow for the varied analyses to be performed in the context of a clinical trial. 
Moreover, the core investigators must be ever cognizant of maintaining the tissue banks at each site and 
providing tissue for the Organoid, model organisms, and biomarkers core as well as aiding the biostatistics 
core in interpretation of immunohistochemical results with respect to patient outcomes. Amidst this panoply of 
diverse tasks, the core investigators must maintain an organized hierarchy of task assignment and carefully set 
priorities. This will be achieved by experienced pathologist-investigators who will interact regularly and 
effectively to integrate the work being done across multiple institutions and develop protocols and procedures 
with established safeguards of quality assurance. Finally, this integrated Pathology Core will be dynamic, with 
attention to weaknesses in the data interpretation and consideration of innovative approaches prompted by 
either necessity or opportunity."

 The overall objective of this project is for OncoArendi Therapeutics (OAT) to develop a myocardin-related
transcription factor (MRTF) pathway inhibitor as a novel, disease-modifying oral medicine for
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), with superior medical benefit and improved safety and tolerability
compared to current treatments. The main goal of this Phase I proposal is the selection of a compound to
enter IND-enabling studies.
 IPF is a chronic, progressive and fatal fibrotic lung disease, with a median survival of 3-5 years after
diagnosis. Current treatment options for IPF are limited with minimal efficacy and significant tolerability issues.
It is estimated that about 5 million people worldwide suffer from IPF. Thus, IPF represents a serious, common
disease with a massive unmet medical need for new medicines that will improve morbidity and mortality.
 Literature reports have provided evidence that the MRTF pathway is critical to the initiation and progression
of fibrosis, and underpins the various processes that are responsible for fibrosis. One of the current standard-
of-care treatments for IPF, pirfenidone, inhibits MRFT activation, albeit in very high concentrations. Thus,
selective and potent MRTF pathway inhibitors offer an innovative strategy to attenuate fibrosis. OAT has
identified MRTF pathway inhibitors, with the most potent compound, OAT-5116, having an IC50 of 50 nM in the
primary screening assay, involving inhibition of MRTF/SRF dependent luciferase assay on transfected HEK293
T cells. OAT-5116 is >1000-fold more potent than pirfenidone (IC50 >100 µM) in this assay. The two key Aims
of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1: Lead Optimization to identify a Clinical Development Candidate
(CDC). A detailed Medicinal Chemistry strategy has been developed to synthesize and test novel analogs of
the current chemical pharmacophore, and address the developability liabilities of the lead compound, OAT-
5116, including poor oral pharmacokinetic profile in rodents, high plasma protein binding, and hERG potassium
channel inhibition. All the relevant in vitro and in vivo biological and DMPK assays have been established.
The ultimate goal of these studies is the selection of a CDC compound with the appropriate biological,
chemical, DMPK and developability characteristics to progress into IND-enabling studies. Specific Aim 2:
Effects of the CDC in the Bleomycin-induced Model of IPF in Mouse. The dose-response effects of oral
administration of the CDC compound will be examined in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model in
mouse, the gold-standard rodent model of IPF. The compound will be administered using a therapeutic
treatment paradigm and its effects will be compared with those of oral pirfenidone, a current treatment for IPF.
 The results from this Phase I application will expand the scientific rationale for an MRTF pathway
inhibitor as an innovative, disease-modifying oral therapy for IPF, and lay the foundation for the future clinical
development of the optimized compound that OAT selects for progression to IND-enabling studies."
10915509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emotion dysregulation is transdiagnostic, integral to most affective and disruptive behavior disorders, and is
associated with impaired functioning across domains from health to academics. The study of dysregulation of
negative affect, or irritability, has resulted in a better understanding of how it predicts later impairment and
general psychopathology and has identified neural correlates. However, there has been less focus on
dysregulation of positive affect, despite recent evidence suggesting it contributes to the development of
psychopathology, particularly externalizing symptoms, and impairment across domains from general to social
functioning. Dysregulated positive affect may not only confer independent risk, but is likely to have separate
underlying neural correlates, as positive and negative emotional valence systems are different domains in the
Research Domains Criteria. While surgency, the temperamental measure of high positive affect, has been
related to increased aggression and externalizing symptoms in infants and young children, how this relates to
clinical dysregulation of positive affect, or excitability, is unknown. Moreover, the relationships between surgency
and excitability with psychopathology and impairment have been largely unstudied in young children. This
proposal addresses these gaps in understanding by studying the overlapping and separable contributions of
surgency (normative high positive affect), excitability (clinically related dysregulated positive affect), and
irritability (clinically related dysregulated negative affect) to symptoms of psychopathology and impairment in
school age children. Additionally, this proposal will assess the overlap and distinctions in brain-behavior
relationships between dysregulation in positive and negative affect. Specifically, 100 7-10-year-old children
enriched for emotion dysregulation will be assessed using a research diagnostic interview and parent and self-
report measures of emotional and general functioning at baseline and after one year. At baseline, children will
undergo functional MRI scans during emotion response and regulation tasks. Consistent with the NIMH Strategic
plan, particularly Strategy Objective 2, to “chart mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how
to intervene,” understanding the separable contributions of surgency, excitability, and irritability to risk trajectories
and elucidating the neural correlates of such can provide meaningful targets for early identification and
intervention in multiple disorders. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts in emotion regulation and
development, developmental psychology and psychopathology, and longitudinal and statistical methodology, the
training provided through this proposal will facilitate the applicant gaining expertise in fMRI methods for studying
affective processing, dimensional constructs in developmental psychopathology, and longitudinal design and
analysis. This training will provide the foundational components of the applicant's long-term goals of
understanding the neural and behavioral development of emotion dysregulation, specifically excitability, to inform
early identification and interventions for improving emotion regulation prior to significant impairment."

Childhood trajectories of high or increasing internalizing and externalizing symptoms appear to mutually re-
enforce one each other and be associated with the emergence and exacerbation of pathology in early adolescence
and early adulthood. They have been linked with alterations in neural networks underlying emotional

from irrelevant emotional stimuli. Although, these neural networks undergo maturational changes during
adolescence, their development in relation to improvements in emotional interference resistance has yet to be
well characterized. Examining neural activity to emotional distracters during working memory provides rich
information about the temporal sequence of emotional interference resistance. Emotional distracters recruit an
extended affective visual system (AVS) comprised of the occipital-temporal cortex, medial temporal
lobe/amygdala, ventrolateral (vl), ventromedial (vm), and dorsomedial (dm) prefrontal cortex (PFC); and
modulate early neural activity within the AVS, as evidenced by greater magnitude of event-related potentials
(ERPs) (i.e., N1, P1, and LPP). The vlPFC and vmPFC and their connections to the amygdala, facilitated by the
uncinate fasciculi (UF) white matter tracts, play a central role in emotional interference resistance. What remains
unclear is how development of AVS regions as well as the structural and functional connectivity within the AVS
promotes emotional interference resistance and contributes to trajectories of psychopathology common to
internalizing and externalizing disorders. We address these questions through the following Aims: 1) characterize
the neurodevelopment of emotional interference resistance in adolescence through adulthood; 2) characterize
the neurodevelopment of the temporal dynamics of neural activity during processing of emotional distracters; 3)
examine how deviations in neurodevelopment of emotional interference resistance create a vulnerability to life
stress to predict increasing trajectories of internalizing/externalizing symptoms; and (4) characterize
relationships among developmental changes in multimodal neuroimaging indices and trajectories of
internalizing/externalizing symptoms. We will recruit a sample of 210 10-25 year-olds (78% White, 13% Black,
4% Asian, 2% Latinx, 3% Multiracial) in an accelerated longitudinal design, with 30 participants (50%M/F, 2/3
at high risk based on parental diagnosis of an internalizing and/or externalizing disorder and elevated current
internalizing and/or externalizing symptoms) in each age range (10-11, 12-13, 14-15, 16-17, 18-19, 20-22, and 23-
25) followed longitudinally every 9 months to provide five assessments of internalizing and/or externalizing
symptoms, and every 18 months to provide three neural assessments. We will use multimodal neuroimaging to
investigate the neurodevelopment of resisting emotional interference using an emotional delay working memory
task. Findings will clarify neurodevelopment of emotional interference resistance and inform targeted early
intervention strategies designed to maximally strengthen the identified neural networks."

Despite the high prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the recommended annual ophthalmic exam for diabetic
patients has a very low compliance rate, only around 43%. Many patients do not seek proper medical attention
because DR is asymptomatic in the early stage, and thus they miss the most effective period to halt DR
progression and prevent vision loss. Moreover, ophthalmic equipment for DR exams is predominantly limited to
urban areas, restricting access by patients in rural communities with limited incomes. All of these issues create
an urgent need for cost-effective, widely-available approaches that enable early detection of DR.
Our long-term goal is to develop a non-image-based, artificial intelligence (AI) tool for primary care physicians to
assess patients' risk for DR using comorbidity data and routine lab results, which are widely available. It will help
physicians recommend ophthalmic exams and individual screening frequency for at-risk patients confidently.
The accuracy of our approach is close to the fundus-image-based DR detection tools, and it is much easier to
use and more cost-effective. Preliminary studies demonstrated the feasibility of detecting DR with 90% accuracy.
Our approach is promising to increase the compliance rate of the recommended ophthalmic exams among
asymptotic patients, break the barrier to ubiquitous diabetic eye care in rural communities, and save thousands
of people from blindness. If successful, our approach has the potential to transform future DR care from reactive
to proactive. It will identify the causative and clinically modifiable factors of DR. This will lead to a proactive DR
prevention and management tool to reduce avoidable DR and defray healthcare costs.
As the next step in pursuing our long-term goal, we will develop predictive models for DR and extract training
data from Cerner Health Facts, a comprehensive, relational database of real-world, de-identified, HIPAA-
compliant patient data. However, similar to other electronic-health-record (EHR) databases, its quality suffers
from missing values, imbalanced and unlabeled data. In addition, although EHR data are multi-dimensional, due
to technical challenges, they are often examined in two-view features (either longitudinal or cross-sectional).
Thus the high order statistics (correlation information) are not well utilized in healthcare analytics.
Tensor information is important to optimize medical decision making and provides a unique angle to address the
problems of missing, imbalanced, or unlabeled data. The progression of a disease or the outcome of treatment
not only depends on the patient's current health conditions, but also his or her medical history. To realize the full
potential of EHR data, this project will study novel imputation, augmentation, classification, and machine learning
techniques by simultaneously handling the longitudinal information. The methodology developed from this study
will help improve the quality of EHR data and the accuracy of the predictive models for a wide range of diseases.

Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness among American adults,
many diabetic patients do not comply with the recommended ophthalmic exams because DR is
asymptomatic in the early stages, and thus patients miss the most effective period to halt DR

10915549,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Dizziness in the emergency department (ED) is a common problem with many opportunities to implement
efficient and evidenced-based practices. In DIZZTINCT-1, we developed and evaluated an implementation
strategy that focused on increasing the performance of the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT) and canalith repositioning
maneuver (CRM) in the ED by applying a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) -centric approach. We
found that the strategy substantially increased DHT and CRM performance. In implementation fidelity
interviews, providers who started using the DHT and CRM typically reported positive experiences, as reflect by
the following quote: “He immediately felt better and walked out about 20 minutes later…it was awesome.”
There was also a decrease in the use of head CTs, which are typically unnecessary with a BPPV-centric
approach. Importantly, the decrease in head CTs did not lead to an increase in stroke misdiagnosis.
DIZZTINCT-1, however, is limited in its potential to scale-up because it used investigator led education
sessions, cash incentives, and did not have adequate engagement at nonacademic facilities. We learned
about important revisions to the strategy that could increase generalizability and more routine provider use,
particularly at nonacademic EDs. In DIZZTINCT-2, we will enhance and refine the strategy in four ways. First,
the education sessions will be more generalizable because we will utilize local providers and an online CME
program. Second, we will broaden the target providers to include nurses since we learned that nurses can play
a major role in implementing the BPPV-centric approach. Third, we will respond to provider requests to expand
the topic to include best practices for assessing stroke risk in dizziness visits and evidence-based diagnosis &
management for vestibular neuritis. Expanding the topic could both increase exposures to the BPPV-centric
resources and create more opportunities for best practices. Fourth, we will add patient-oriented resources,
which also responds to providers’ requests and increases opportunities for best management. For DIZZTINCT-
2, we have partnered with Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to test the strategy. KPSC has 12
EDs and ~40,000 annual dizziness visits. DIZZTINCT-2 will use a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness
trial of a stepped wedge randomized trial for the ED implementation strategy and an embedded randomized
patient-level dissemination strategy. We have the following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the impact of
the revised and enhanced BPPV-centric implementation strategy on DHT/CRM performance in dizziness visits,
at academic and nonacademic EDs, using a randomized stepped wedge design. Aim 2. To evaluate clinical
outcomes associated with the implementation strategy using both a stepped wedge ED-level strategy and an
embedded randomized clinical trial of a patient-level dissemination strategy. DIZZTINCT-2 is the first study to
apply and evaluate a broad strategy to enhance optimal care in dizziness visits, to focus on nonacademic EDs,
and to measure both implementation and patient outcomes."
10915551,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The accumulation of epidemiologic evidence on the roles that policies, systems and environments (PSE)
play in influencing health behaviors such as eating and physical activity has led to increased interest in
applying the socio-ecological framework and community-engaged approaches to the development of “multi-
level interventions” targeting at-risk communities. Evaluation of such innovative interventions, often to address
social determinants of health and reduce health disparities, is often challenged as it may be impractical to use
the `gold-standard' cluster randomized trial design. Further, the social and behavioral science theories that
provide the foundation for the development of interventions may be overlooked when efforts are made to scale-
up an intervention. Systems science methods, which have been used to investigate complex causal
mechanisms, have been proposed as an alternative for evaluating such interventions. However, their
application, which typically involves computational modeling, requires researchers from disparate disciplines to
integrate their knowledge and skills at a level that can be difficult to attain.
 The proposed summer research education program aims to create a learning environment that will support
the training of researchers from diverse disciplines to collaborate effectively with each other and with
community stakeholders, with the goal of accelerating the translation of research into practice. Specifically,
over three summers, it will (i) provide 75 researchers (pre-docs, postdocs, investigators) interested in
addressing social determinants of health, with the basic knowledge and skills necessary for applying systems
science and data science methods, while also (ii) providing more advanced knowledge and skills to apply
either of these methods as well as foundational knowledge of social and behavioral science theories and
approaches, to researchers in quantitative methods-focused disciplines (such as math, computer science,
biostatistics). In addition, this program will also (iii) provide a three-week practicum to 30 of the 75 trainees who
are interested in gaining hands-on experience in working with large datasets.
 The proposed program will consist of two components: (i) a 3-week curriculum consisting of virtual didactic
sessions with learning activities; and (ii) a 3-week practicum for a subset of trainees who will work closely with
each other to build and refine agent-based models and interpret results for policy-makers with the engagement
of stakeholders. The recruitment and selection plan will be developed with an equity lens, and with an Advisory
Committee providing guidance and oversight. To create the learning environment for this training program, we
will select applicants to create a cohort that is also diverse in academic background and lived experiences."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 54 children and exhibits
significant phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in UBE3B, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
have been identified in patients presenting with intellectual disability, lack of speech, and ASD. The specific
mechanism through which disruption of UBE3B, and subsequent dysregulation of its substrates, leads to
neurodevelopmental abnormalities is unknown. Our group has previously shown that a Ube3b constitutive
knockout mouse model exhibits a complete loss of vocalization and defects in nest building, as well as reduced
dendritic complexity, length, and spine density. In this proposal, I will investigate the neuronal function of UBE3B
by characterizing changes in neuronal activity following loss of UBE3B and identifying its neuronal substrates. I
will apply complimentary electrophysiological and biochemical approaches using a brain-specific conditional
Ube3b knockout mouse model (cKOnestin). I will characterize the electrophysiological properties of cortical
neurons from cKOnestin mice, by evaluating their basal properties, including intrinsic excitability and rheobase
current, and both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, I will identify the neuronal substrates
of UBE3B through analysis of protein levels, protein-protein interactions, and ubiquitination status. I will also
assess the UBE3B-mediated modifications of substrates, including the site of ubiquitination and the ubiquitin
chain topology. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide new insights into the interplay of
ubiquitin signaling and neurodevelopment, as well as advance our knowledge of the specific pathogenic
mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.
 The exceptional research environment at UT Southwestern Medical Center, combined with the collective
expertise of the mentorship team, will provide excellent training. Goals for this fellowship training include
becoming knowledgeable in the relevant literature and attaining proficiency in both experimental procedures and
communicating scientific information to varied audiences. The skills obtained through these goals will build the
foundation for an independent and successful lead investigator in scientific research."

MarPam Pharma is developing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell treatment that targets viral reservoirs
for durable remission of HIV without the need for antiretroviral therapies (ART). This treatment is an HIV-specific
CAR (specifically, CD4-MBL-CAR) T cell therapy that employs the CXCR5 chemokine receptor as a homing
device to direct anti-HIV killer T cells into “hidden” viral reservoirs in B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid tissue,
so that they can kill HIV-producing cells where the majority of viral replication occurs. Using the best in vivo
nonhuman primate (NHP) model of HIV, we developed CAR/CXCR5-T cells that show successful homing to B
cell follicles, evidence of direct contact with viral RNA+ infected cells, markedly decreased virus in B cell follicles,
and decreased viral loads in CAR/CXCR5-T cell treated ART-suppressed Simian immunodeficiency virus-
infected NHPs compared to controls. Our human CAR/CXCR5-T cells also show CXCR5-driven migratory and
anti-HIV killing characteristics in vitro, showing promise as a treatment for people living with HIV. FDA-approved
CAR-T cell therapies are successful in treating various cancers; however, the processes to produce the CAR-
T cells are complex, involving leukapheresis and ex-vivo manipulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
prior to reinfusion back to the patient. Thus, recent efforts are focused on developing universal, off-the-shelf in
vivo-produced CAR-T cell therapies, including the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery systems.
Since the process to produce an off-the-shelf AAV gene therapy is a fraction of the complexity of ex-vivo
production of CAR-T cells individualized for each patient, the expectation is that AAV gene therapy to produce
CAR/CXCR5-T cells will eventually prove to be less costly than current life-long therapy for HIV, which is
estimated at over $500,000. To develop an off-the-shelf in vivo CAR/CXCR5-T cell product, this proposal seeks
to perform the necessary first steps of producing receptor-targeted, AAV-directed CAR-T cells (second
generation [2G] -CAR/CXCR5-T cells) in vitro and assessing their targeted efficacy against HIV. Using our
intellectual property-protected technology to assemble AAV composites for receptor-targeted gene delivery, we
propose in vitro proof-of-concept studies to produce receptor-targeted, AAV-directed 2G-CAR/CXCR5-T cells
using AAV composites containing anti-CD5 monoclonal antibody (CD5mab) and carrying a 2G-CAR/CXCR5
DNA payload. As T cells specifically express CD5 on their cell surface, AAV-CD5mab composites carrying 2G-
CAR/CXCR5 DNA payload (AAV-CD5mab-2G-CAR/CXCR5) are expected to specifically bind CD5 on T cells
and transduce them, thereby producing functional 2G-CAR/CXCR5-T cells that home to B cell follicles in vivo.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the groundwork not only for Phase II IND-enabling studies
for in vivo HIV 2G-CAR/CXCR5-T cells, but also for other therapeutic areas that could benefit from off-the-shelf
in vivo production of CAR-T cells."
10920130,"Sequencing RNA modifications is challenging due to the existence of over 170 unique chemical
nucleotide alterations. tRNAs, constituting about 25% of cellular RNA and decoding 61 mRNA
codons, often have 8-14 modifications each. These modifications are central to functional
diversity, cellular regulation, and diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders.
Unbiased, comprehensive sequencing of RNA modifications is vital for understanding these
complex processes. Current techniques, including Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), depend
on complementary DNA (cDNA) intermediates, failing to capture the complete tRNA
modification profile. They often overlook or bias certain types, and are not suitable for tRNAs,
which have reverse-transcriptase-blocking nucleotide modifications. The heterogeneity of tRNA
modifications, with over 100 identified types showing varying modification levels, adds
complexity. Although nanopores show potential for sequencing all RNA modifications, training
over 170 different standard nucleotide modifications while preserving unique signature
electronic signals presents formidable challenges. Mass spectrometry (MS), despite its ability to
characterize RNA modifications without bias, has limitations. Conventional MS methods like
tandem MS (MS2) lose essential details about modified nucleotide location and co-occurrence,
and the complexity of its spectra obstructs high-throughput sequencing of intricate tRNAs. To
counter these challenges, we've developed next-generation mass spectrometry-based
sequencing (NGMS-Seq) methods. Utilizing two-dimensional (2D) mass-retention time ladders
instead of MS2 fragmentation, NGMS-Seq has demonstrated the potential to sequence specific
tRNAs de novo and simultaneously sequence and quantify all nucleotide modifications without
bias. In this application, our aims are to: 1) advance NGMS-Seq toward high throughput for
direct sequencing of various tRNA samples, including physiologically relevant ones, and 2)
enhance technologies to quantitatively map tRNA modifications site-specifically and track their
dynamic changes within a melanoma model. Our refined techniques, initially tailored for tRNA,
have the potential to extend to longer RNAs and small noncoding RNAs. Through our
commercialization initiatives, we aim to make NGMS-Seq widely accessible, providing
comprehensive RNA sequence and modification data, thereby offering vital insights into RNA-
associated diseases."

 The ultimate goal of the project is to develop the first disease-modifying (“curative”) and non-hormonal
therapeutic for endometriosis. Endometriosis is considered the greatest overlooked epidemic in women’s health,
affecting approximately 10% of women worldwide. It is a major cause of infertility and disability among
adolescents and women across all ethnicities. Shockingly, to date, there is no cure for this chronic and prevalent
disease that takes 6-10 years to be diagnosed. Currently, the management of endometriosis is through hormonal
treatment, pain therapies, or surgical interventions—which fail to reverse the disease or address the root cause—
are often insufficient. Hormone pills and GnRH antagonists (causing “medical menopause”) prescribed to
patients with endometriosis can induce many undesirable side effects. Many women who undergo endometriosis
excision will have recurrence within 5 years of surgery. Hysterectomies are recommended for women who do not
experience relief through less invasive methods. NICHD has made the development of a non-hormonal
therapeutic for endometriosis a high priority goal, which corresponds with the 2021-2025 NIH-wide strategic
plan and “bold prediction” of advancing one non-hormonal therapeutic for endometriosis to clinical trials. Our
group intends to accomplish this “bold prediction” with this Phase IIB SBIR application.
 Our team developed a novel therapeutic option for endometriosis by targeting a downstream component of
a pathway known to contribute to endometriosis pathogenesis, endometrial migration and invasion. We
successfully accomplished our milestones from both Phase I and II of our SBIR Fast-Track Grant. A lead
candidate was identified that has therapeutic efficacy with no observable toxicity. The lead candidate specifically
and selectively inhibits this downstream component and shows success in cell potency assays, apoptosis assays,
serum stability, membrane permeability, and vaginal absorption without irritation. In vivo, the lead candidate
importantly demonstrates endometriotic lesion regression accompanied by increased apoptosis, decreased
proliferation, and decreased downstream target genes without inducing toxicity or alterations in estrous cyclicity.
Thus, our lead candidate exhibits great potential to act as an endometriosis therapeutic to eliminate lesions.
Other molecules have regressed endometriosis progression in academic settings, but have off-target or upstream
pathway targets that make them undesirable therapeutics as undesired side effects are induced.
 During Phase IIB, we will determine a minimal efficacious dose of the lead therapeutic, optimize
formulations of the lead candidate, and finish IND-enabling toxicology studies for submission of an IND package
to the FDA. By doing so, we will develop a non-hormonal therapeutic that is disease-modifying; consequently,
due to the high unmet need for endometriosis therapeutics, successful completion of our aims will allow us to
submit our application to the FDA for IND allowance and commence clinical trials. Successful completion of this
project will give women suffering from endometriosis a curative solution to eliminating the disease."

Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 780,000 deaths annually. In the US,
a substantial burden of gastric cancer continues to be observed in American Indians (AI) in the Southwest and
Alaska Natives. The Navajo Nation, a tribe in the Southwest, is experiencing higher incidence of gastric cancer
compared to the general population in the region, possibly due to high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection and other contributing factors, like diet. H. pylori strains that vary in the production of virulence
factors have been credited with the causal link between H. pylori and gastric cancer. In particular, cytotoxin-
associated gene A (cagA) and its pathogenicity island function together to deliver CagA proteins into host cells
to promote inflammation and gastric cancer. Diets high in salt and processed meats, and low in fruits and
vegetables were further associated with altering the protective lining of the stomach and enhancing expression
of cagA. Thus, it is essential to understand the role of H. pylori and diet for gastric cancer prevention. While
various treatment options for H. pylori infection are available, they are not always successful due to patient
adherence and clinic level barriers, further leading to persistent infection and added expense. However,
treatment failures in the Navajo Nation are unknown. My approach allows me to leverage my previous
experience working with AI tribes to determine risk factors for gastric cancer and identify strategies to reduce
them. I will implement my research among adults using the Navajo healthcare system. My objectives are two-
fold. First, in the predoctoral F99 phase, I will determine the prevalence, virulence, and dietary correlates
of H. pylori infection among Navajo adults. Second, in the postdoctoral K00 phase, I will characterize risk
factors for H. pylori reinfection and patient experiences with H. pylori treatment. To achieve these
objectives, I will use my previous experience in conducting health assessments to execute a cross-sectional
study to measure H. pylori infection, cagA virulence gene status, and diet through health and diet surveys and
laboratory analysis of stool specimens (F99). Then, I will use my gained expertise in H. pylori and previous
experience with qualitative research to determine H. pylori reinfection risk and barriers to treatment adherence
using quantitative and qualitative research approaches (K00). I will test my hypotheses through the following
aims: AIM 1: Test that H. pylori infections, particularly with the cagA gene, are highly prevalent in Navajo adults
compared to other non-AI populations, and that diets high in salt, processed meats, and low in vegetables are
associated with H. pylori infection risk. AIM 2: Test that patient chronic health conditions are associated with H.
pylori reinfection risk, and obtain information about patient-level and institutional level barriers to treatment
adherence. My proposed research will elucidate an understanding of risk factors for gastric cancer among the
Navajo, a population experiencing a high disease burden, with the goal of developing interventions to improve
cancer outcomes, in alignment with the mission of the NCI and NIH."

The Culturally Augmented Learning In Biomedical Informatics Research (CALIBIR) program will address the
clear need to enhance diversity within the biomedical informatics and data science field, particularly the dearth
of underrepresented individuals pursuing graduate programs and careers in different areas of this field. The
CALIBIR program builds on the research strengths in biomedical informatics and data science and the existing
didactic training in biomedical informatics, engineering, statistics, and computer science topics at Wake Forest
School of Medicine and Wake Forest University. The Program Faculty (including the Program Directors) have
vast academic and professional experiences; a history of administration and collaboration on diversity-focused
research and training programs; and ongoing research and funding in the five research domains proposed for
CALIBIR training: Clinical Research Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare Informatics, Imaging
Informatics, and Translational Bioinformatics. Thus, we are well-positioned to offer a 10-week summer
research immersion experience to train and educate undergraduate and master’s level underrepresented
students and promote greater interest, exposure, and research experiences in biomedical informatics and data
science. The CALIBIR program will support mentored research training activities of 60 scholars (12 students
per summer). The program's overall goals are to: 1) increase underrepresented students' skills, preparation,
and commitment to participate in cutting-edge biomedical informatics research; 2) offer lectures and hands-on
demonstrations on state-of-the-art biomedical informatics techniques via a “Biomedical Informatics Boot
Camp”; 3) provide group seminars and networking events covering responsible conduct of research, scientific
dissemination, and professional development topics; 4) build trainee experience in scientific communication via
a journal club, writing workshop, and an abstract and oral presentation of their research; 5) cultivate influential
and long-lasting collaborative relationships between trainees and mentors to highlight the value of teamwork in
research and provide an accepting and inclusive environment that will positively impact students from diverse
backgrounds; and 6) encourage underrepresented students to pursue doctoral studies and careers in
biomedical informatics and data science fields through an experience that exemplifies the excitement and
challenges of clinically relevant investigations. The overarching goal of the CALIBIR program is to expand the
pool of underrepresented students who successfully complete a graduate degree in a biomedical informatics-
related field up to a PhD and increase the diversity of the biomedical informatics and data science workforce.
In sum, the CALIBIR program takes advantage of unique strengths, existing infrastructure, and long-standing
collaborations among diverse program faculty to ensure the successful creation and implementation of the
program. It offers several innovative approaches to provide both technical and professional preparation to
recruit and retain underrepresented students in the biomedical informatics and data science fields."

Pain and accompanying symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea, a condition defined by cramping-associated pain
during menstruation without identifiable pelvic pathology, are a true disturbance to daily activities and quality of
life. High prevalence of dysmenorrhea translates to over 855 million people suffering from this condition
worldwide. Severe symptoms of dysmenorrhea force up to 33% to miss school or work, resulting in 600 million
hours missed annually and an annual economic burden of over $2 billion in the U.S. Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormonal contraception (HC) are the first-line options for treating
dysmenorrhea, but with 20-25% of people not responding to NSAIDs and many finding the side effects of NSAID
and HC use to be unacceptable, the overall effectiveness of these therapies is limited. Thus, there remains an
urgent unmet medical need worldwide to develop a safe, effective, and accessible therapy for dysmenorrhea.
Recent clinical studies have shown that acupuncture-based nerve stimulation of a specific peripheral nerve can
be effective for treating dysmenorrhea symptoms. While promising for reducing pain and distress, acupuncture’s
low acceptability to patients and the need for scheduled care at the clinic prevent its potential widespread use
for dysmenorrhea treatment. To build on this work and address the need for a comprehensive therapy for
dysmenorrhea, TheraNova has developed the SoleStim Neuromodulation System, a portable, non-invasive
,Plantar Neuromodulation (PNM) device for non-invasive stimulation of peripheral nerves. The SoleStim
Neuromodulation System consists of standard, inexpensive gel electrodes and a small, battery-powered signal
generator. The goal of this proposal is to conduct a pilot clinical study to evaluate the potential of SoleStim as a
treatment for dysmenorrhea. We will conduct a 16-week, sham-controlled study in 33 participants with primary
dysmenorrhea. Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated via participant-reported daily pain scores and standard
dysmenorrhea surveys. For the first 8 weeks (Baseline Phase), participants will self-report on dysmenorrhea
symptoms to establish baseline values. Then, participants will be randomized (1:1) to the active or sham
treatment and self-administer daily treatment at home for the duration of the 8-week Treatment Phase while also
providing self-reports on dysmenorrhea symptoms. In this single study, we will evaluate metrics of feasibility
(Specific Aim 1) and acceptability (Specific Aim 2). After demonstrating feasibility in Phase I, we will conduct a
long-term pivotal clinical trial in Phase II to support FDA clearance and enable commercialization after Phase II."

 We propose to develop a chronically implantable, all optical, optogenetic nerve interface that can non-
invasively, optically neuromodulate individual axons of nerves in the parasympathetic or peripheral nervous
system. The proposed interface would benefit treatment of human disease and disabilities related to the
thoracic and abdominal organs and systems innervated by the cervical vagus nerve, such as epilepsy and
metabolic disorders. We propose to optically interface from afferent/efferent axons in these nerves with the
goal of modulating organs or brain circuits innervated by them. The bidirectional optical neural interface
technology will utilize the capabilities of optogenetics enabled through viral vector transfection of afferent
and/or efferent neurons with genetically targeted, optically activated reporter proteins and opsins.
 Our central premise is that we can use optics to communicate with axons in a nerve. For optical
approaches to work we need to convert action potentials into an optical signal. This can be done using
genetically encoded calcium indicators or other voltage sensitive proteins that change their fluorescent
properties upon action potential generation in a neuron. Because nerves do not naturally express optical
proteins, we will work with transgenic mice that express these proteins and use these mice models to refine
our system before making it available for other researchers to use.
We aim to develop a compact, bench-top optical system that can be shared with other research labs to provide
the unique ability of being able to interrogate specific fascicles and axons within the nerve. In the future, this
technology has potential for translation to human clinical applications. The technology in the proposal is
ambitious, but we have formed an outstanding team of cell biologists, neuroscientists, biomedical, electrical,
and mechanical engineers. The team has an excellent track record of successful collaborations on multiple

We aim to develop a compact, bench-top optical system that can be shared with other research labs to provide
the unique ability of being able to interrogate specific fascicles and axons within the nerve. In the future, this
technology has potential for translation to human clinical applications. The technology in the proposal is
ambitious, but we have formed an outstanding team of cell biologists, neuroscientists, biomedical, electrical,
and mechanical engineers. The team has an excellent track record of successful collaborations on multiple

10924694,"The search for an HIV cure has been among the highest HIV research priorities for several decades. While
much knowledge was gained regarding the persistent HIV reservoir, HIV eradication remains elusive. There is
an emerging consensus that the HIV reservoir is not a fixed assortment of epigenetically silenced proviruses
but rather a dynamic compendium of mostly defective proviruses. We recently showed that most infections in
primary human CD4+ T memory cell subsets result in non-productive, latent infections. These findings were
made possible thanks to our newly developed HIV vector system, which permits distinguishing and separating
primary human cells harboring non-productive and productive proviruses. Transcriptome analysis of specific
CD4+ T cell subsets identified transcript isoforms differentially expressed in the context of productive and non-
productive infections. We propose an integrated experimental approach that will systematically dissect non-
productive infections in primary human CD4+ T cells. First, we will analyze the proviral structure of non-
productive and productive infections (Specific Aim 1), which will include both integration site analysis as well as
detection of defective proviruses. We will identify and validate the transcriptional programs specific for
productive and non-productive infections using advanced bulk and single cell long read transcriptome analysis
approaches (Specific Aim 2). We will validate findings using genome editing tools and a panel of viral mutants
lacking functional accessory genes. Lastly, we will dissect the role of innate immune responses in the context
of non-productive infections (Specific Aim 3) by determining to what extent stimulation with gamma cytokines
or Type-1 interferon changes the propensity of CD4+ T cell subsets to support non-productive infections.
Collectively, the proposed studies will deliver insights into the interplay between non-productive HIV infections
and host cell environment pointing to the molecular mechanisms that drive non-productive infections in primary
human CD4+ T cells. The results obtained will also provide essential information on potential HIV latency
biomarkers and directly inform of innovative HIV cure strategies."

Cellular behavior is regulated by diverse signaling mechanisms that often depend on molecular dynamics
precisely organized in space and time. The transient positioning and kinetics of molecular events is lost in bulk
biochemical analysis and in single cell proteomics. Understanding such factors requires visualization and
quantitative analysis of molecular events in living cells and tissues, now made possible by combining molecular
probe design, high-resolution live cell microscopy and computational image analysis. However, combining these
diverse technology into a working whole for the quantitative analysis of live cell signaling networks remains
challenging. The proposed Center for Cell Signaling Analysis aims to democratize advanced methods that
put these tools in the hands of scientists who have not devoted their careers to imaging. We propose to develop
and disseminate a user-friendly and integrated pipeline that combines 1) biosensors, optogenetics and
chemogenetics 2) modular, high-speed, and high-resolution light-sheet microscopes, and 3) image analysis and
computational modeling to derive signaling network architecture, including the causality and kinetics of
connections. The Center will concentrate its integration effort between 3 Technology Development Projects:
 i) Optogenetics, chemogenetics, and biosensors based on alternate approaches with complementary
 capabilities and reduced perturbation of signaling.
 ii) Multiple modular, cost-effective, and high-resolution 3D light-sheet microscopes that can be
 assembled rapidly by non-experts and deliver ~220 and ~450 nm lateral and axial resolution. These
 will be designed to maximally leverage computer vision workflows, biosensors, and
optogenetics/chemogenetics.
 iii) A library of open-source Fiji-based plugins for the analysis of subcellular signal transduction in 2D
 and 3D live cell time-lapse data using advanced methods in statistical time series analysis.
Through our collaborative Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), we will iteratively refine and improve our probes,
imaging platforms and image analysis methods. We have identified 8 DBPs that address topics in immune cell
migration, immunological synapse function, mechanosensation, sarcomere formation, cancer dissemination and
drug resistance, synaptic plasticity, and ventral furrow ingression. We propose a strong dissemination
component that maximally leverages existing infrastructure, including imaging facilities with >3,000 users
located throughout the United States, the widely adopted Fiji software ecosystem, Addgene, GitHub, and Applied
Scientific Instrumentation. We will provide extensive training (in person, remote, and topic-driven courses) and
centrally organize the Center outputs on a comprehensive and continuously updated website."

Over the past nine years, the Collaboratory Coordinating Center (CC) has worked with the NIH to nurture 21
Demonstration Projects by providing leadership, resources, tools, training, and coordination of diverse
elements. Six of these trials were designed to speed scientific solutions for addressing the national opioid
public health crisis. The CC maintains expert Core Working Groups and committees; supports dissemination
and implementation efforts; and established the online Living Textbook of Pragmatic Clinical Trials to translate
learnings for the research community. The Collaboratory CC has created and disseminated guidance so that
investigators can work with health systems to embed their research in the delivery of health care, and use
routinely collected health care information as a core data source for the full spectrum of clinical research,
including randomized trials. The Collaboratory CC is also providing essential guidance to funders, reviewers,
institutional review boards (IRBs), and data safety monitoring boards regarding the ethical and regulatory
aspects of embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs).
In this next phase of work, we will build on lessons learned and new experiences gleaned from the next set of
Demonstration Projects to continue to refine the pragmatic trials model (Aims 1-3).
During the next funding period, the Collaboratory CC will have the following Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Work collaboratively with each Demonstration Project team supported through the
 Collaboratory program, including their partnering health care systems, to develop, test, and implement the
 proposed Demonstration Projects while providing technical, design, and coordination support.
 Specific Aim 2: Further develop and refine technical and policy guidelines and best practices for the
 effective conduct of research studies in partnership with health care systems.
 Specific Aim 3: Learn, develop, and disseminate the best strategies for conducting successful embedded
 pragmatic clinical trials by engaging health care systems—including those with less historical involvement in
 research studies—as research partners to improve health and care delivery."
10928731,"SUMMARY: Circular RNAs are an important class of RNAs that have fundamental cellular functions and
have the potential to be novel types of RNA-based therapeutics. Circular RNAs are difficult to synthesize
and purify due to low yields after gel extraction. Resolving these issues could be a major benefit to
academic and biotechnology research on circular RNA. The goal of this proposal is to make RNA synthesis
as simple as a DNA plasmid prep kit. To do this, we will develop two new high-impact, market-ready kits.
Our first kit is the “Chimerna In-cell circular RNA purification kit,” which uses our “Tornado” technology
for expressing RNAs as a circle. When used in E. coli, the Tornado technology results in the production of
RNA at high levels not previously seen with conventional linear RNAs. The stability of circular RNA allows it
to accumulate to high levels in E. coli, and also confers high stability in vitro and when transfected into
mammalian cells, thus mitigating the persistent degradation problem of conventional linear RNAs. We also
developed a new RNA-purification aptamer which we incorporate into our circles to achieve high purity with
a simple one-step elution protocol. Thus, our kit will overcome the problems of in vitro transcription: low
yield, complex enzymatic synthesis reaction, RNA degradation, and the problem of laborious RNA
purification. We will also prepare the Chimerna RNA labeling kit that repurposes a tRNA-modifying
enzyme for RNA labeling. This companion product, comprising the enzyme and suitable substrates, will
markedly enhance the ability to impart biotin, fluorescent dyes, cell-targeting moieties, and other useful tags
to RNA. In order to develop these new commercial products, our specific aims are: (1) To optimize a kit for
high-yield circular RNA synthesis and purification without in vitro transcription. We will optimize the E. coli
cell line, culturing conditions, dextran binding and elution conditions, and RNA storage conditions. We will
also establish protocols, manuals, reproducibility and stability conditions for kitting; (2) To develop an
approach for simple and efficient RNA labeling. We will optimize reaction labeling conditions and target
RNA sequences, develop protocols, manuals, and establish stability conditions that will allow us to create a
user-ready RNA labeling kit; (3) To develop a system for highly efficient elution of tag-free RNA circles from
dextran beads. We will perform pilot experiments to test a completely new RNA purification kit involving on-
bead RNA circularization and elution triggered by a small molecule. This system is highly simplified and
fast, with even fewer contaminants and produces RNA without any affinity tags. Taken together, this project
will result in the first kit for synthesizing circular RNA, an especially challenging but highly important type of
RNA. This technology is extended with our innovative RNA labeling kit, enabling researchers to label, tag,
or track RNAs for diverse applications. These new kits will markedly accelerate circular RNA research."
10928739,"Abstract: Data-Driven Sleep Biomarkers of Brain Health, Heart Health, and Mortality
Sleep state signals encode critical biological information about brain and cardiovascular health. However,
present approaches to polysomnography data (“sleep studies”) discard most of the collected information, instead
providing, using visual analysis and rules from the 1960s, relatively unsophisticated metrics (e.g., 30-second
sleep stages, apnea-hypopnea index). Visual scoring is also limited by interscorer inconsistencies. Recent
advances in computational science and Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) open the way for 1)
standard scoring with unparalleled precision and consistency; 2) new data-driven, quantitative measures. There
is a critical unmet need for new tools, algorithms and datasets that leverage recent advances in data science to
develop robust sleep-based biomarkers of brain and cardiovascular health.
We propose to create a Complete AI Sleep Report (CAISR) algorithm for all standard sleep measures, and a
progressively accumulating library of novel analytics. We are ideally positioned to close this gap. We will
assemble between our six collaborating institutions sleep data from >200K patients (35,000 already assembled),
we have experience curating large clinical physiology and electronic medical records data for research; we have
progress already underway with building a scalable public data sharing portal; we have deep expertise in basic
and translational sleep science; and we have an established record of successfully developing and validating
novel deep learning tools and algorithms to analyze sleep data.
Our long-term goal is to increase the value of sleep physiology data by replacing manual analysis by open-
source data-driven AI approaches. Our central hypothesis is that sleep signals carry measurable latent
information about mortality and brain and heart health. Our specific aims are: 1) Create an online public portal
with de-identified polysomnograms (PSG) and cross-sectional and longitudinal electronic health records (EHR)
data for >200K adult and pediatric patients; 2) Implement CAISR and validated that it generalizes across age,
sex, and race. CAISR will also be externally validated on >13,000 PSGs from public research cohorts; 3) Develop
AI algorithms that a) differentiate patients with vs. without existing brain and heart disease; b) predict primary
outcomes of all cause and cardiovascular mortality, and secondary outcomes of heart disease (coronary artery
disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension); and brain disease
(dementia, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage).
Completing these aims will lead to these expected outcomes: (1) sleep data across the lifespan, (2) sleep scoring
AI algorithms validated across age, sex, and ethnicity; (3) predictors of mortality and brain and heart health.
These outcomes will lead to new testable hypotheses, make sleep diagnostics more accessible to socially and
biologically underserved groups, and stimulate progress in data-driven sleep research."
10924715,"PROJECT SUMMARY
TB remains the leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons, with one in four deaths attributable to TB. While
the majority of healthy individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) control infection, co-infection
with HIV increases the risk of progressing to TB disease by over 20 fold. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) decreases
the incidence of ATB and remains the cornerstone of HIV care. However, the incidence of TB in HIV-co-infected
individuals remains four-to-seven-fold higher after ART than in HIV-uninfected people in TB-endemic settings,
regardless of the duration of ART or attainment of high CD4+ T cell counts. We have developed macaque models
of Mtb/HIV co-infection which utilize ART. Depending on the timing of ART-intervention, SIV replication in the
periphery as well as tissues is either effectively inhibited or not, recapitulating the whole spectrum of human
tissue-specific and clinical outcomes. This allows for detailed longitudinal and mechanistic studies that are not
possible in humans. Our data shows a clear role for indole 2,3, dioxygenase (IDO) in both the inhibition of
effective immunity to TB as well as in orchestrating chronic immune activation in SIV-infected macaques.
Blockade of IDO pathway improves the outcome of TB and HIV in singly infected macaques. Here, we will use
inhibition approaches in the RM models of Mtb/SIV/ART to test the hypothesis that this will improve anti-TB
immune responses, inhibit HIV-induced chronic immune activation, thus allowing the immune system to better
control the co-infection. Our proposed studies will provide unprecedented novel insights into the molecular
mechanisms that mediate reactivation of TB in the setting of HIV infection, and identify protective immune
mechanisms that will inform the development of new treatment regimens and vaccines for TB."
10925441,"Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of acute and chronic
infections. Antibiotic resistance is a growing challenge and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections are
more difficult to treat, resulting in increased burden for both patients and healthcare systems. S. aureus causes
the majority of skin infections in active-duty military and veterans, and skin colonization is a known precursor of
infection. How this pathogen colonizes the skin is unknown. In recent microscopy studies, S. aureus developed
biofilm communities during skin colonization and the quorum-sensing pathway was found to be activated. To
investigate this further, we developed a new mouse skin colonization model and determined the MRSA global
transcriptional response. Based on these RNAseq studies, our central hypothesis is that MRSA has a unique
expression program that supports adherence and survival in the skin environment. We will address the
innovative idea that MRSA specifically induces a select group of virulence factors to survive in the harsh skin
environment and evade innate defenses. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the MRSA skin adherence and
regulatory profile. We hypothesize that MRSA adapts to the skin environment by expressing a specific
subset of adhesins, toxins and exo-enzymes. We will evaluate the contributions of specific virulence factors
using in vitro adherence to human keratinocytes, skin explant colonization, wound healing assays and mouse
models of skin colonization. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of quorum-sensing and skin
upregulated factors to MRSA immune evasion. We hypothesize that MRSA evades skin immunity using
quorum-sensing regulated factors. Toward this end, we will define the role of urease in pH homeostasis and
biofilm development, and the function of SasF surface protein in skin fatty acid resistance. We will use our
developed human skin-like media to aid functional and regulatory studies on MRSA immune evasion factors. We
will also determine the contribution of quorum-sensing factors in resistance mechanisms to antimicrobial
peptides and skin fatty acids. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess the function of surface proteins in MRSA
dissemination from colonization. In preliminary studies, we discovered an important role for SasF in skin infection
and immune evasion. We hypothesize that MRSA strains with SasF have enhanced capacity to cause
systemic disease. We will determine the function of SasF in response to neutrophil challenge, and we will
evaluate the contribution of this protein to systemic dissemination in mouse models. Finally we will characterize
civilian and military MRSA strain collections for presence and function of SasF to determine whether this protein
is a biomarker of invasive disease. An improved understanding of how MRSA colonizes the skin and transitions
to infection could open avenues to developing therapeutic strategies for minimizing the skin infection burden."
10926851,"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) plays a pivotal role in transcription. Normal physiological processes
depend upon precise transcriptional controls, whereas transcriptional dysregulation is the basis of numerous
pathologies that include cancer. Pol II recruitment to specific promoters is regulated by multiple cofactors that
include the multi-subunit Mediator, which directly binds both to enhancer/promoter-bound
transcriptional activators and to Pol II to facilitate gene activation. Following initiation and promoter escape,
Pol II remains subject to regulation by multiple elongation factors, acting either at Pol II pause-release or
productive elongation steps. Pol II(G) is a recently described form of Pol II that contains the tightly
associated, metazoan-specific Gdown1 polypeptide along with the normal 12 subunits. Our genetic-
based studies of Pol II(G) have demonstrated that Gdown1 is essential for early embryonic development
and for cell-specific transcription in quiescent hepatocytes, in which heavy localization to gene bodies of
highly expressed liver-specific genes (e.g., albumin) is indicative of elongation functions and in which ablation
leads to downregulation of both liver-specific and lipid metabolism genes, cell cycle re-entry and (in the
absence of p53) a premalignant type of transformation. Studies in hepatocarcinoma and breast cancer cells
have also indicated a key role for Gdown1 in cell growth and in expression of lipid metabolism genes, which
are generally important for maintenance of cancer cell growth. Our biochemical studies have revealed that
the Pol II-associated Gdown1 conditionally represses basal (activator- and Mediator-independent)
transcription initiation by preventing association of TFIIB and TFIIF with Pol II, thereby establishing a potential
checkpoint and eliciting a strong requirement for activator-bound Mediator to overcome repression. Our
structural studies have defined Gdown1 interaction sites on Pol II and provided clues regarding Mediator
interactions that might facilitate its reversal of the conditionally repressed initiation capacity of Pol II(G),
although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. With the general objective of understanding the
molecular mechanisms of action of Pol II(G) in conjunction with its roles in breast cancer and hepatocarcinoma
cells, especially on Gdown1-regulated cell-specific and lipid metabolism genes, as a potential basis for new
cancer therapeutics, our specific aims are: (i) to investigate the mechanisms underlying Mediator-dependent
transcription initiation and post-initiation events by Pol II(G), including concomitant, newly described
interactions with general transcription factors and elongation factor TFIIS, using powerful in vitro transcription
and immobilized template assays and CX-MS and cryo-EM structural analyses of interacting complexes and (ii)
to investigate Gdown1 functions in hepatocarcinoma cells in promoter-proximal pausing, pause release and
transcriptional processivity using (a) a multiomics cell-based approach in conjunction with acute degradation of
Gdown1 and (b) biochemical (in vitro reconstitution of these processes with purified factors and recombinant
chromatin templates) and structural (CX-MS and cryo-EM) analyses of Pol II(G) elongation factor complexes."

is in the top 3 states nationwide for opioid prescriptions to pregnant mothers. Additionally, AR has the second
highest number of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the nation, thus making this an ideal site to study the effects
of opioid use in a state with other environmental stressors. Recruitment will be from a robust Women's Mental
Health Program, which saw 899 pregnant women with opioid use disorder last year, the general obstetrical clinic,
and the 64 bed academic Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at UAMS. Innovative strategies for recruitment will
include investigator attendance at prenatal classes and a Community Advisory Board, while retention will be
bolstered by frequent electronic communication, updated contact information, financial and scheduling
incentives. Follow-up will be performed at the Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute in a state of the
art Pediatric Clinical Research Unit. Compliance for follow-up is anticipated to be challenging for this trial, so
innovative strategies to encourage compliance will include monetary incentives, ease of scheduling, and case
managers to arrange free travel, meals, and other needs for participants. Parents will also be given results of their
psychological exams to encourage compliance. This project is well supported by the Translational Research
Institute (TRI), home of a Clinical and Translational Science Award. This site has extensive experience conducting
multicenter trials and is currently involved in two similar trials, which will be completed by the time this site will begin
enrolling patients assuring this site will be ready to begin enrollment after funding. This site also has extensive
experience in opioid research and will actively contribute to protocol development. Major strengths of this site
include experience in pk/pd modeling, a robust telemedicine program to bolster awareness of the study statewide,
and a Center for Implementation Science to implement evidence based weaning medication. This site has a large
diverse clinical population with an average of 3450 annual deliveries, approximately 10% of the state's annual
deliveries, with 273 opiate exposed neonates and 49 pharmacologically treated newborns annually. There are
53% white, 33% African American and 11% Hispanic mothers who deliver annually at UAMS. Public insurance
accounts for 81% and private insurance accounts for 16% of all newborn admissions. This site has an excellent
track record of participation in multicenter trials (12 trials are open currently) and a robust scholarly publication
record. The assembled group of researchers at this site will contribute to the analysis, interpretation, and
publication of results. The environment at this site is supportive of this initiative, and leadership will provide the
support, protected time, and the infrastructure to successfully complete the study."

 Ria Health is a nationally scaling early-stage telemedicine and technology company that
treats alcohol use disorder with a combination of objective measures of drinking (twice daily
breathalyzer measures through our app), physician-supervised medications, and group and
individual coaching - the Ria Treatment Platform. Ria has enrolled more than 4,500 patients,
is available in 45 states, and is covered by major insurers. Ria has accumulated more than
300K breathalyzer measures from enrolled patients that demonstrate a reduction in alcohol
use of 50% at 1 month and 75% at 12 months. Mean retention in treatment is 10 months.
 The incidence and burdens of alcohol-associated liver disease are growing. There are no
automated methods that screen specifically for early alcohol-associated liver disease. In this
project we will use a large electronic health record system (Epic at Stanford University
Health) to identify patients with elevated liver function tests who are at increased risk for
occult alcohol use disorder. A feasibility analysis of Epic records at Stanford identified
>56,460 adult patients with elevated liver function tests (AST, ALT, GGT) who could be
screened for this study. Patients with elevated liver function tests will be invited by an “honest
broker” to be screened for alcohol use disorder and, if alcohol use disorder is present, to
receive treatment through Ria.
 We hypothesize that patients with alcohol use disorder and elevated liver function tests
who would otherwise not seek treatment will be motivated to engage in treatment. We will
conduct a randomized wait-list controlled study in 124 subjects to demonstrate the efficacy of
the Ria Treatment Platform. A comprehensive set of outcome measures will be assessed, with
percent of subjects without heavy drinking in the final 4 weeks defined as the primary
outcome.
 The project has several innovative features. It is the first to use mass screening of a
large electronic health records system to identify potential cases of alcohol use disorder with
abnormal liver function tests and to engage them in treatment. Given the morbidity and
mortality of alcohol use disorder, new methods to identify and engage these patients earlier
are urgently needed. We will also conduct the first randomized controlled trial of the Ria
Treatment Platform, providing crucial validation for payers."
10923877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The slow growing nature of most prostate cancers (PCa) provides multiple windows of opportunity to block or
delay disease progression to significantly reduce patient suffering and mortality. This is especially true following
the failure of radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiation therapy (RT) of PCa prior to androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT; i.e., medical or surgical castration). Biochemical recurrent PCa is sensitively indicated by rising blood
prostate specific antigen (PSA). ADT is not curative and causes many serious adverse effects. Our goal is to
develop Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN, Korean Angelica) root ethanolic extract or its constituent(s) as a safer and
practical modality for PCa interception akin to secondary prevention to delay ADT or avoid it entirely. We
hypothesize that (1) the PCa interception efficacy of AGN and its pyranocoumarins in animal models is
extendable into human PCa patients, given sufficient AGN dosage and exposure duration; (2) multiple
mechanisms including immune surveillance and suppression of inflammation contribute to the clinical cancer
interception activity. The scientific premise is based on the presence of novel active pyranocoumarin compounds
distinct from those in soy, tea, fish oil, raspberries, mushrooms, and cannabis and reported broad spectrum anti-
cancer efficacy in animal cancer models. Moreover, we have demonstrated a) Oral bioavailability and favorable
pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics in rodents and in humans; b) Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and 3A4 first-pass
conversion of pyranocoumarins decursin (D) and decursinol angelate (DA) to their metabolite decursinol (DOH);
c) Proficient tissue retention of decursinol in mouse target prostate; d) Animal modeling of AGN and decursinol
showing independence of the androgen receptor axis, avoiding side effects of ADT drugs and making blood PSA
a reliable readout for cancer burden; e) AGN enhanced immune and decreased inflammatory gene signatures
in an animal PCa model; and f) A single AGN dose in human subjects increased natural killer [NK] mRNA
signature and decreased IL-8 chemokine mRNA in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We propose 3
specific aims in post-RP and post-RT patients with rising plasma PSA that is “clean” (due to prostate already
removed) and indicative of the biochemical recurrent PCa burden. Aim 1. Characterize pyranocoumarin PK dose
response proportionality to AGN supplement and food effects in 12 patients to probe any metabolic ceiling and
minimize food-herbal interaction. Aim 2. Evaluate safety and recurrent PCa (PSA)-interception efficacy of twice
daily AGN supplement in a Phase I/II trial with 36 patients. Aim 3. Measure acute- and repeated-dose PK metrics,
CYP 2C19 and 3A4 metabolizer status and changes of immune and inflammation biomarkers to correlate to PSA
outcomes. Impacts: The safety information and a favorable PSA response will guide future randomized control
trials to prevent or treat PCa and other cancers. The novel knowledge on PK dose response, repeated dose PK
behavior, CYP pharmacogenetics and the immune biomarkers not only fills in critical gaps for AGN supplements
in cancer patients, but also is exportable to disease prevention and therapy beyond oncology."

10918627,"Project Summary/Abstract
Research over the past decade has revealed the importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the control
of cardiac remodeling and heart failure. We have characterized a cardiac specific lncRNA in the control of
calcium handling in human and mouse cardiomyocytes. Knockout of this lncRNA causes dysregulation of
calcium handling in cardiomyocytes and impairs cardiac function. Knockout mice are susceptible to cardiac
arrhythmias caused by catecholaminergic challenging and premature death. In this project, we propose to (1)
determine mechanisms by which lncRNA regulates gene expression at the transcription level, (2) determine
how lncRNA regulates gene expression at the alternative splicing level, and (3) determine cardiac protection
conferred by lncRNA in response to pathological stresses. The results from this project have the potential to
facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for heart disease."
10919327,"There is no cure or disease-modifying therapy for patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease
(idPD) that carry no genetic mutations and have no family history of this devastating neurodegenerative
condition. Mark Therapeutics (MarkTx) is addressing the unmet needs of idPD patients by developing a
first-in-class disease-modifying gene therapy that can halt disease progression in this largest group of
Parkinson’s patients (~80% of all cases). MarkTx’s solution is to use an Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) gene
therapy tailored specifically to idPD patients, which will compensate for the epigenetic loss of expression of a
specific protein in these patients, restore critical cellular functions in dopaminergic (DA) neurons and halt their
pathological loss. Using our first experimental candidate (Mark101), we obtained proof-of-concept for efficacy
and safety of MarkTx’s gene therapy and demonstrated that one-time AAV-driven expression of functional
PLA2g6L protein can stop pathological loss of DA neurons in substantia nigra, and significantly slow progression
of motor dysfunction in preclinical idPD-like aging mouse model. Intellectual property of MarkTx is secured by 4
issued patents and an exclusive license from Boston University.
 MarkTx is seeking SBIR Phase I financing to perform feasibility studies and rigorous preclinical optimization
/validation of the improved candidates for Mark’s therapy. The specific Aims of Phase I are:
Aim 1: Optimization and initial testing of new (improved) AAV candidate constructs.
Aim 2: In vitro validation of therapeutic potential of best candidates in human DA neurons.
Aim 3: In vivo treatment optimization and validation of PLA2g6L delivery to DA neurons in live animals.
 MarkTx’s team has strong scientific and business experience and is fully qualified to achieve all the goals of
the current proposal. Successful completion of Phase I will identify the best therapeutic candidate(s) for MarkTx’s
gene therapy, validate their ability to express PLA2g6L and restore critical cellular function in DA neurons that is
being lost in idPD patients. Achievement of well-defined milestones will further de-risk MarkTx therapy and
ensure effective transition to SBIR Phase II. NINDS/SBIR funding is essential for development and eventual
commercialization of MarkTx’s highly promising, first-in-class disease-modifying gene therapy tailored
specifically for idPD patients. We strongly believe our innovative therapeutic approach to idPD will be a game-
changer and a major step towards ultimate victory in the fight against this currently incurable and devastating
disease in aging humans. The goals of MarkTx’s proposal fully align with the mission of the NINDS."
10915435,"Project Summary
The ability to establish and maintain subcellular organization is a fundamental design principle of biological
systems. We recently discovered that many jumbo phage establish surprisingly complex subcellular organization
involving a nucleus-like structure or “phage nucleus” that compartmentalizes phage replication within the host
cytoplasm. The phage nucleus carries out many functions previously only attributed to the eukaryotic nucleus
including segregation of key processes (DNA replication and repair, mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis and
metabolism) and selective protein import and mRNA export. However, the phage nucleus is structurally dissimilar
to the eukaryotic nucleus, being mainly composed of a single layer of a phage-encoded protein and lacking
evident openings for exchange with the cytoplasm instead of a double-layer lipid membrane containing prominent
pore complexes. We have identified the key protein that makes up the phage nucleus shell; however, the
components required to assemble a fully functional phage nucleus and their roles in this multipurpose structure
remain unknown. Here we aim to identify and characterize additional proteins that are required to construct a
fully functional phage nucleus to gain greater insight into the biology of these understudied viruses and the
underlying principles of subcellular compartmentalization previously observed almost exclusively in eukaryotes.
We will use an integrative approach that combines genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and in situ and in vitro

The proposed study aims to optimize and validate the Veris Cancer Care Platform for the needs of medically
underserved cancer patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy. The Veris Health platform is a remote patient
monitoring and communication system designed to bridge the gap between clinical visits and provide oncology
care teams with objective data during high-risk periods.
This study will specifically focus on optimizing the Veris Health platform for patients with language barriers,
limited access to technology, and socioeconomic disparities. By incorporating user-centered design and working
closely with community health centers, the research team will ensure that the platform is culturally and
linguistically appropriate, easy to use, and accessible for all patients.
The study will use a mixed-methods approach to validate the effectiveness of the optimized platform, including
quantitative data analysis and qualitative interviews with patients and healthcare providers. The goal is to
demonstrate the potential for the Veris Health platform to improve outcomes for vulnerable populations by
reducing hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and the economic burden of cancer care.
This study has the potential to lead to a marketable product that can be used by cancer patients across the
United States, regardless of their socioeconomic status, primary language, or access to technology. The Veris
Cancer Care Platform has already been successfully piloted in partnership with New Jersey Cancer Care and is
poised to make a significant impact in the field of remote patient monitoring for cancer care."

 This Phase I STTR project is a collaboration between PGXL Technologies, LLC
(Company) and the University of Louisville Research Foundation (University) to develop an
innovative urine collection kit used to detect obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients.
 PGXL Technologies is developing a US-Patented, non-invasive urine-based assay for
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. The test is comprised of a panel of four protein
biomarkers detected in urine. OSA occurs in up to 3% of children and as much as 10% of the
pediatric orthodontic population including 7% in adults. OSA can lead to disturbed sleep,
neurobehavioral problems, neurocognitive impairments, and hypertension in children and
adults. Diagnosis is primarily limited to in-clinic sleep studies because patient history and
physical examinations are not adequately able to differentiate OSA from primary snoring (PS).
Polysomnography (PSG) tests are administered in sleep studies and are the gold standard for
diagnosis, but they are highly expensive, require an overnight stay in a supervised sleep clinic,
are difficult for children as well as adults, and do not meet the need for efficient screening for
OSA. There is only one at-home sleep diagnostic that has been cleared by the FDA for use in
children and it requires attachment of wires and sensors overnight, which is challenging to
implement with children. There is an unmet need for a rapid and sensitive test for OSA that can
be used for potential diagnosis, patient monitoring as they undergo treatment, and screening of
broader populations.
 The Company is developing an immunoassay-based multiplex panel comprised of four
proteins (uromodulin, urocortin-3, orosomucoid-1, and kallikrein) associated with stress and
hypoxia detected in the urine of children with OSA. Preliminary published data indicates that this
set of markers provides a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.5% for OSA in
children. To confirm the efficacy of this test-panel with controlled studies we will require shipping
of urine samples to our testing facility after collection. Securing the integrity of the proteins
during shipping and storage is essential to our success. To address this challenge there is an
imminent need to develop a simple yet rigorous process for stabilizing the proteins during
specimen transport. In this Phase I STTR project we will use an innovative silica-based reagent
(BioCaRGOS) developed by our team and demonstrate that the reagent is compatible with our
immunoassay system and stabilizes the target proteins in urine under shipping conditions. This
proof-of-concept will enable the design of a rigorous urine collection kit required for our Phase II
clinical studies.
 Completion of these goals will enable advancement toward a laboratory developed test
using a novel method for stabilizing and processing of urine samples needed for routine
collection and provide an approach towards FDA clearance of a multiplexed high throughput
assay for OSA. Commercialization of these products will enable delivery of a critically needed
rapid test that can be administered by PGXL Technologies or licensed to CLIA-certified clinical
labs. This will fill a need for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective identification of OSA in children
and adults."
10923910,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Dystonia is a brain-based disorder that leads affected muscles to twist and spasm, contorting the sufferer
into painful and disabling positions. Dystonia afflicts 1 in 1000 people (the third-most common movement
disorder). It can occur in isolation or be a symptom of many other neurological disorders (eg, stroke, cerebral
palsy, Parkinson disease). Chronic pain, disability, and withdrawal from school or work are common, and in
severe cases, dystonia can be fatal. A shared electrophysiologic abnormality links many types of dystonia:
local and long-range disinhibition. This led to the hypothesis that impaired inhibition, and a related finding,
poorly-refined sensory feedback, leads to abnormal co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles,
producing the contorting movements of dystonia. However, impaired inhibition is only one step in a mechanistic
cascade that leads to dystonia – the underlying structural abnormalities that produce disinhibition are unknown.
 Structural abnormalities in neurological disorders point the way to improved therapies. This proposal will use
MRI to investigate brain regions that are potential anatomical substrates for impaired inhibition, with a larger
goal of identifying new targets for dystonia treatment and prevention. We will address two key gaps in current
dystonia knowledge: 1) the role of interhemispheric projections in regulating cortical motor activity (long-range
disinhibition); 2) the role of the striatal compartments, striosome and matrix, in inhibiting unwanted movements.
The study will employ novel structural, diffusion, and functional MRI techniques in two dystonia patient cohorts:
we will carry out our imaging assessments in the most common forms in adults, cervical dystonia, and children,
limb dystonia. These clinically-distinct populations will help determine which abnormalities are shared
(mechanisms generalizable to other dystonias) and which are specific to certain types of dystonia.
 The mission of this Mentored Career Development Award is to seek fundamental knowledge about the
brain’s inhibitory control of movement, and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of dystonia. This goal
parallels that of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: to investigate the neural
mechanisms of sensory and motor circuits that can be compromised by disease. The proposal is tailored to my
educational and training needs, ensuring that I will be prepared to succeed as an independent investigator
utilizing the tools of systems neuroscience. With this award, I will gain essential training in: 1) biostatistics and
network assessment tools such as principal component analysis, graph theoretical analysis, and causal
inference modeling; 2) the experimental design and implementation of functional MRI (fMRI), including both
task-based and resting state methods; 3) knowledge of the structure and connectivity of the striatum, pallidum,
and thalamus. I will benefit from an environment enriched in neuroimaging, movement disorders, and
neurodevelopmental expertise, where I can build a substantial foundation for a successful independent
research career devoted to improving the therapies available for treating dystonia."

Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening disease, occurring in up to 40% of cancer patients. About 40% of
BM patients have multiple (≥4) BMs (mBMs). Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), which has long been the
standard of care for mBMs patients, has shown pronounced impairment of neurocognitive functions. Stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) has improved tumor control and reduced negative effect on cognition function, compared to
WBRT. However, it has been historically reserved only for patients with <4 BMs. Recently, several clinical trials
reported strong evidence to support SRS for mBMs patients. National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines hence no longer restrict the number of BMs for SRS. However, the larger BM number in mBMs
patients substantially increases the complexity of treatment planning. Conventional manual forward planning to
manually determine plan parameters becomes cumbersome and impractical for mBMs. Modern inverse planning
methods can determine plan parameters by solving an optimization problem that is composed of multiple
objectives designed for various clinical or practical considerations, while the priorities among these objectives
affect the resulting plan quality. The physician’s preferences for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and
precisely conveyed to the planner, especially for mBMs patients due to the varying number, size, and locations
of BMs. Hence, the best physician-preferred plan is often achieved through extensive trial-and-error priority
tuning and several rounds of interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can
take up to hours, and plan quality may be suboptimal and can vary significantly, due to the varying levels of
physician and planner’s skills and physician-planner communication and cooperation, leading to deteriorated
clinical outcome. Inspired by the recent colossal advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL), on intelligent decision-making in
computer visions and robotics, we propose to develop an artificial intelligence driven automatic SRS treatment
planning system for effective management of mBMs (Aid-mBMs), learning a human-level intelligence on
treatment planning from human experts. We envision the system to have two deep neural networks: DNN-R that
acts as an AI-physician to predict the physician’s preferences for each individual patient, and DNN-P that acts
as an AI-planner to tune the priorities to achieve a plan of physician’s satisfaction. We will pursue two specific
aims. Aim 1. System prototype development: We will collect human expert planners’ priority-tuning actions and
develop DNN-R and DNN-P via interleaved DIRL-based reward function learning and DRL-based policy learning.
Aim 2. System improvement and end-to-end evaluation: We will perform a prospective study to improve our
system based on human expert’s further fine-tuning actions on the generated AI plans, and then evaluate the
feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our system. Upon completion, Aid-mBMs will provide high-quality and
efficient SRS treatment planning to benefit mBMs patients, especially those in resource-limited regions."

The goal of the ASU Biomarker Characterization Center is to improve ovarian and lung cancer screening through
the development of biologically-relevant circulating immune biomarkers. The scientific approach of our Center is
based on several fundamental principles. First, that altered cancer protein expression, structure, and post-
translational modifications induce host autoantibodies to create circulating biomarkers. Second, that alterations
in microbial antigen expression (such as respiratory pathogens) also induce immunity, often detected in benign
rather than malignant disease. Third, that the protein modifications, as well as the immune response to these
neoantigenic structures, are heterogeneous between people, and that serologic biomarkers may complement
circulating protein biomarkers. We will take a systems immunology approach to discover three types of
antibodies, anti-microbial antibodies, autoantibodies and anti-aberrant glycoprotein antibodies. Our proposal
builds on our extensive experiences with cancer biomarker discovery and immunoproteomics technology
development. Our previous results on autoantibody biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded phase 2
multicenter validation studies and led to a CLIA-certified commercial blood test. Our results have shown that
multiplexed panels of autoantibodies are required for adequate predictive value. With prior EDRN support, we
have developed a set of innovative immunoproteomics technologies, namely high-density nucleic acid
programmable protein array (HD-NAPPA), contra-capture protein array (CCPA) and multiplexed in solution
protein array (MISPA), that, together with the largest full-length human and microbial gene collection at our
DNASU plasmid repository, enable us to study antibodies against the full human proteome, microbial proteomes
and the human O-glycoproteome for antibody biomarker signatures in cancer. Our Meso Scale Diagnostics
(MSD) team has fielded over 3,000 instruments worldwide, and over 700 commercially available biomarker assay
kits. Our expertise at serologic assay development was selected by Operation Warp Speed to use the V-PLEX®
serology panels as the basis of its standard binding assays for immunogenicity assessments in all funded Phase
III clinical trials of COVID vaccines. We will use our MSD MultiArray platform to migrate the top serologic and
protein markers for their utility in our target clinical applications. We will collaborate with experts on lung and
ovarian cancer screening at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Boston University, MD Anderson Cancer
Center, and German Cancer Research Center, who will also provide access to high-quality well-characterized
samples to develop circulating biomarkers to enhance ovarian cancer screening or to distinguish benign from
malignant pulmonary nodules. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will perform Phase I discovery by
screening protein arrays with cancer patient and control sera for cancer or control-specific antibodies. Candidate
biomarkers for both lung and ovarian cancers will undergo Phase 2 validation."
10927278,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in men and the second most common cause of cancer death
in the United States. The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Prostate Working
Group (PWG) was formed in the year 2000 to address a wide range of questions about effective prostate
cancer control. The PWG studied the rapid increase in prostate cancer diagnoses after PSA screening started
in the late 1980s to estimate lead time and overdiagnosis associated with the test. The PWG studied the
decline in prostate cancer mortality that began in the early 1990s to quantify the plausible contributions of PSA
screening and changes in primary treatments. The PWG also studied how to interpret trends in racial
disparities in incidence and survival, how to manage men with low-risk disease on active surveillance, and how
to reconcile apparently discordant randomized trials of PSA screening and radical prostatectomy.
In recent years, technologies surrounding prostate cancer screening and treatment have evolved rapidly, and
opportunities to improve patient care using personalized data abound. Genetic testing can identify men at
increased risk for developing aggressive disease, new biomarkers and imaging tools can help men avoid
unnecessary biopsies, and new hormonal treatments can lengthen survival for men with advanced disease.
The objective of this application is to extend PWG models to evaluate optimal ways to utilize personalized data
to improve patient care while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve early
detection using novel stratification approaches and whether we can safely limit overtreatment and other harms
by tailored choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the United States
and in international cancer control settings with different resources and priorities.
Our specific aims are as follows. Aim 1: Precision early detection, including risk-stratified screening and biopsy
using genetic tests, novel biomarkers, and imaging technology. Aim 2: Precision active surveillance, including
adaptive biopsy intervals and imaging technology. Aim 3: Precision treatment, including type and timing of
initial and salvage therapies. Aim 4: Targeting screening, biopsy, and treatment policies to reduce racial
disparities. Aim 5: Prioritizing screening and treatment interventions in international settings. These aims are
highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 7 of the 9 targeted priority areas to
varying degrees. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with
clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration put us in
a strong position to answer critical and impactful questions about how best to control this most common cancer
in men."
10925214,"Microtubule-based kinesin and dynein motors drive a plethora of cellular processes, including
intracellular transport of cellular cargo, assembly and function of the mitotic spindle, and ciliary function. While
the chemical and physical properties of kinesins are well studied in vitro, much less is known about the specific
function and regulation of kinesin motors in cells. The KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP motor, subsequently referred to as
kinesin-2, drives intracellular transport of various cargos and is also essential for intraflagellar transport (IFT),
a specialized transport inside eukaryotic cilia. Cilia are protrusions of the plasma membrane that are
supported by a specialized microtubule structure called the axoneme. Primary cilia are solitary and immotile
cilia that sense various stimuli in a tissue-specific manner. They can, for instance, sense the presence of
morphogens during development, odorants in the nasal cavity, or the strength of urine flow in kidney tubules.
Given these essential sensory functions, it is not surprising that ciliary malfunction underlies many diseases
that are collectively classified as ciliopathies.
 During IFT, large protein assemblies called IFT trains are continuously transported within cilia. The
IFT trains are loaded with specific cargo at the ciliary base and subsequently recruit kinesin-2 motors for
transport along the axonemal microtubules to the tip of the cilium. There, the kinesin-2 motors are released,
specific cargo is unloaded, and the trains are remodeled for subsequent transport back to the ciliary base by
dynein-2. It is well established that the loss of any subunit of the kinesin-2 motor leads to the complete
absence of cilia, and interference with IFT leads to the disappearance of already established cilia. From
experiments with the single-celled flagellate Chlamydomonas we know that tubulin influx into cilia via IFT is
modulated as a function of cilium length. Based on this finding several recent models aimed at explaining the
impact of IFT on cilium length and cilium maintenance attribute high importance to the ciliary tubulin
concentration. However, the change in tubulin concentration in these models cannot explain all experimental
findings and it is likely that other aspects of IFT in addition to tubulin import are important for ciliary length and
structure. Thus, the importance of IFT for the ciliary structure and the regulation of kinesin-2 motor for IFT is
only incompletely understood, especially in mammalian systems. In this proposal, we will use a combination
of biochemical & cellular assays, protein & genome engineering, and high-resolution microscopy to study how
kinesin-2 is regulated for IFT and to delineate the impact of kinesin-2 driven IFT on the structure of mammalian
cilia. At the center of our approach are engineered kinesin proteins whose activity can be precisely regulated
in time and space externally by the investigator. The work laid out in this proposal will shed light on the function
and regulation of kinesin motors in mammalian cilia and thereby promote the development of therapies aimed
at alleviating or curing motor protein-associated human diseases."

HIV-1 reservoir cells are a small subset of CD4 T cells that harbor chromosomally integrated HIV-1 DNA, persist
life-long and represent the major barrier to a cure of HIV-1 infection. For a long time, proviruses in these cells
have been regarded as transcriptionally silent, which permits them to escape from host immune recognition and
to resist antiviral host immunity. However, recent studies enabled by single-genome and single-cell analytic
technologies have shown that these cells can frequently be transcriptionally active and vulnerable to host
immune responses. In line with this observation, our recent work suggested that viral reservoir cells may be
subject to immune-mediated host selection forces that promote the elimination of proviruses integrated in
permissive chromatin locations supporting active viral transcription, while proviruses in repressive
heterochromatin locations appear to have a selection advantage. The central hypothesis of this application is
that these naturally occurring immune selection mechanisms can be accelerated through specific immunological
interventions that exploit weaknesses and vulnerabilities of HIV-1 reservoir cells. To address this, we propose to
apply a panel of novel single-genome/single-cell analytic techniques to analyze HIV-1 reservoir cell evolution in
three recently-conducted clinical trials in which different interventional strategies were tested in ART-treated
persons. By leveraging existing samples from human interventional studies for such high-resolution analytic
approaches, we will be able to identify specific immunological pathways that may be able to effectively target
viral reservoir cells, and detect specific susceptibilities and vulnerabilities of the HIV-1 reservoir cell pool that can
be exploited in future, more targeted interventions. In specific aim 1, we will use novel single-cell phenotypic
profiling technologies to analyze the interplay between viral reservoir cells and autologous innate and adaptive
immune effector cells in the ACTIVATE study, a randomized-controlled study focusing on the combined
administration of Panobinostat (a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor) with pegylated IFN-α2a. In specific aim
2, we will perform single-cell chromosomal integration site monitoring and phenotyping profiling assays to study
HIV-1 reservoir cell evolution in the RIVER study, a randomized-controlled study in which a therapeutic T-cell
vaccine was administered in conjunction with vorinostat to individuals with acute HIV-1 infection. In specific aim
3, we will investigate immune selection pressure against HIV-1 reservoir cells in the “kitchen sink study”, a human
clinical trial focusing on co-administration of a therapeutic T cell vaccine in conjunction with broadly-neutralizing
antibodies and an innate immune modulator (TLR9 agonist). Together, these detailed investigations, involving a
series of cutting-edge, single-cell next-generation sequencing approaches, will permit to identify evolutionary
selection processes in the viral reservoir cell pool in response to interventional manipulations of human antiviral
immune activity and be highly informative for efforts to limit HIV-1 long-term persistence through clinical
interventions."

Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is the second most prevalent age-related disease, affecting a staggering 463 million
people worldwide. Its onset and progression are attributed to a progressive decline in β-cell function, where the
stressed β-cells resemble damaged (“loser”) cells that failed to undergo clearance by cell fitness competition
(CFC). In essence, CFC is a homeostatic process that embodies the constant monitoring for, and replacing of,
aged, injured, or dysfunctional cells in adult tissue with healthy fully functional (“winner”) cells. These β-cells
demonstrate a wide range of abnormalities, with the resultant metabolic stress correlating with an early loss of
β-cell glucose responsiveness prior to T2D onset. To date, different pharmacological approaches have focused
on increasing the insulin secretion of these dysfunctional -cells. We instead propose a model whereby β-cell
function is restored through the re-establishment of CFC.
Recent breakthrough studies from the Metanoia-UCLA collaboration demonstrated that hypoxia inducible factor-
1-alpha (HIF1) and its target 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) form a
signaling axis, which, when activated in the context of diabetes, remodels cellular metabolism to favor the survival
and block the removal of dysfunctional β-cells at the expense of β-cell function—mimicking the β-cell phenotype
in prediabetes. Using a novel “CFC” mouse model of diabetes, they were able to demonstrate that depletion of
PFKFB3 resulted in regeneration of functional β-cells.
Here, Metanoia will develop new composition entities (NCE) for PFKFB3 inhibition (Aim 2) and establish in vivo
proof-of-concept that pharmacologic targeting of PFKFB3 is able to restore CFC (Aim 1), thus triggering
functional -cell regeneration. This will include: (Aim 1.1) demonstrating that PFKFB3 targeting (depletion)
restores β-cell function, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, (Aim 1.2) determining the comparative efficacy
of PFKFB3 inhibitors to stably control glycemia alone and together with metformin vs. metformin alone, (Aim
1.3) establishing the durability of PFKFB3 inhibitor treatment; and by (Aim 2.1) designing new composition
entities (NCE) for PFKFB3 inhibition, and (Aim 2.2) performing simulation of molecular dynamics on select NCE
candidates.
In addition to the potential to significantly advance the current understanding of the underlying mechanism of
action of T2D, if successful, this study will lead to novel, patentable, first-in-class PFKFB3 inhibitor therapeutic
candidates that target the underlying mechanism of T2D. This treatment has potential to not only alter disease
trajectory in the short term, but also to be curative in the long term via islet enrichment with functional β-cells."

Heavy alcohol use has deleterious effects on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV clinical
outcomes, and indirectly affects health by damaging the couple relationships needed for social support,
economic survival, and well-being. Our formative research with HIV-affected couples in Malawi found that 50%
of alcohol drinkers met criteria for heavy alcohol use. Male peer pressure, desires for friendship, and coping
with poverty were common barriers to reducing consumption. Men expressed desires for an economic or peer-
based intervention to reduce alcohol use, and women were very concerned with how alcohol drains family
financial resources and causes conflict in the couple. Yet, there are currently no interventions that have jointly
addressed the economic and relationship context of drinking in sub-Saharan Africa. To fill this gap, we
developed Mlambe: a combined economic and relationship-strengthening intervention to address heavy
alcohol use among couples affected by HIV. The goal of Mlambe is to redirect funds spent on alcohol into
financial investments and to improve couple relationships and adherence to ART. We posit that engaging
couples to work together on alcohol use and financial goals—equipped with financial and communication
skills—will decrease alcohol use, and improve relationship dynamics and adherence to ART. Our pilot trial
demonstrated that Mlambe was highly feasible and acceptable for couples and showed promising impacts on
health and relationship dynamics. Given this strong preliminary evidence, we propose to conduct a full-scale
randomized controlled trial of Mlambe with couples in Malawi. The specific aims are: (1) to evaluate the
efficacy of Mlambe on our primary outcome of heavy alcohol use, defined as self-reported drinking combined
with an alcohol biomarker called PEth, and on secondary outcomes of viral suppression, adherence to ART,
and other alcohol use metrics; (2) to assess the effects of Mlambe on relationship dynamics (couple
communication, alcohol-specific partner support, and IPV) and explore whether they meditate Mlambe’s effects
on health outcomes; and (3) to compare the costs of each of the two study arms and the cost-effectiveness of
Mlambe. We hypothesize that heavy alcohol use will be reduced in Mlambe as compared to the control arm
and that all partners living with HIV will experience greater viral suppression regardless of drinking status. We
also anticipate that Mlambe will impact alcohol and HIV outcomes through the pathway of relationship
dynamics (e.g., better communication, less IPV). For the trial, we will enroll 250 HIV-affected couples with a
heavy alcohol user and randomize couples to either Mlambe or an enhanced usual care (EUC) control arm. A
cost analysis will be computed for each arm and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to make
comparisons between Mlambe and other strategies for reducing heavy alcohol use. Alcohol interventions for
people living with HIV in SSA may register large impacts by targeting the dyadic and economic context of
alcohol use to ultimately reduce the harms of drinking on relationships, poverty, and HIV health outcomes."

The Science of Child Mental Health Treatment”, 5 T32 MH073517-14 for 5 years for funding to recruit 3 new
postdoctoral fellows per year for a two-year mentored training experience (total 6 trainees per year). No
predoctoral trainees are proposed. The unique focus of this training program is on training researchers in
clinical translational intervention science for child mental disorders to prepare them to become independent
transdisciplinary investigators. Trainees will identify specific domains of mental illness and chose research
strategies that advance such research at a variety of levels—treatment mechanisms, biomarkers, efficacy
study methodology, and implementation science, touching on a large number of Objectives as outlined in the
NIMH Strategic Plan. General goals for the trainees will be to obtain a broad background in current issues in
child mental health treatment research; develop expertise in a scientific method for application to studies of
child treatment; complete significant independent research in a designated area of research; and develop skills
necessary for transitioning into an independent investigator. The program has been very successful, with the
majority of graduates retained and advancing in research, and some 50% of funded trainees coming from
under-represented minority backgrounds.
 Research training in this renewal will sharpen the program’s focus on clinical research, examining
disorder-related areas from a transdiagnostic framework—disruptive/impulsive/compulsive behaviors, autism
and neurodevelopmental disorders, pediatric emotional disorders including self-harm, and other
neuropsychiatric disorders. New emphases include training in “big data” science and research on mental
health disparities. The core training experience will occur within the trainee’s own research and in their close
interaction with primary and secondary mentors and preceptors, and the weekly T32 core seminar. In addition,
participation in individually tailored didactic coursework across the UCLA campus, training in the responsible
conduct of research, and supplementary coursework and experiences will provide broad and specific
knowledge in research approaches.
 The proposal consists of recruiting 3 new postdoctoral fellows/year with medical or doctoral degrees for
a 2-year experience. Postdoctoral trainees will possess training in a discipline relevant to human research and
child mental health treatment. The program will benefit from the breadth of active child treatment research at
UCLA and from the supplemental training available from a wide variety of departments, programs, research
units, and other training activities."

development programs that can allow them to enter the workforce. These challenges can be overcome, at least
in part, by establishing programs to disseminate vanguard scientific information, create diverse and inclusive

Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) is an inclusive, multi-
disciplinary and multicultural organization with a 45+ year history of interventions toward enhancing URM
participation in biomedical and behaviorally-related STEM (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics)
fields. As the largest minority serving scientific organization in the country, SACNAS aims to serve, educate,
promote, and prepare the next generation of successful URMs, particularly Hispanics and Native Americans, to
integrate them into the workforce and promote their advancement. The National Diversity in STEM Conference
has a long history of delivering high-quality programming. It provides a framework for the presentation of
innovative and original research, mentoring opportunities, trans-disciplinary panels, and professional
development workshops to URMs. Furthermore, the Conference will provide opportunities for discussions on
how we can best integrate and diversify biomedical and behavioral research, paying particular attention on how
to be inclusive of those most underserved and underrepresented. The three aims of this proposal are to: 1)
Support student participation at the Conference, 2) Support participation at the Conference of keynote

do not produce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and can be prepared as “off-the-shelf” products. During the
current project period, we have initiated a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of allo-CAR.CD19 NKTs
(NCT03774654) and have treated the first four patients. The therapy was well tolerated and produced objective
responses in three patients. However short persistence of CAR.CD19 NKTs in patient peripheral blood may
decrease durability of response. To protect the therapeutic NKTs from host-mediated rejection, we have
developed new CAR constructs that co-express artificial micro(mi)RNA (amiR), consisting of promoterless
miRNA frames with embedded shRNA sequences targeting B2M and the class II major histocompatibility
complex transactivator (CIITA). These CAR/amiR constructs produce a graded downregulation of HLA class-I
and class-II in CAR-NKTs making them resistant to allogenic T and NK cells. We have also found that CAR-NKT
therapeutic potency can be augmented by pharmacologic or transgenic regulation of LEF1 transcriptional activity,
which controls NKT cell functional fitness. We hypothesize that allo-CAR.CD19 NKTs will continue to be well
tolerated and effective against B-NHL; their therapeutic potency can be further increased via amiR-mediated
protection from immune rejection and via LEF1-mediated retention of their antitumor activity. The following three
specific aims will test our hypotheses: 1) to determine the safety, efficacy, and immunological activity of allo-
CAR.CD19 NKTs in B-NHL patients; 2) to produce cGMP allo-NKTs co-expressing CAR.CD19 with B2M and
CIITA amiRs and to determine the safety, efficacy, and immunological activity of allo-CAR.CD19/amiR NKTs in
B-NHL patients; 3) to evaluate the mechanism by which LEF1 controls NKT cell functional fitness and test the
therapeutic potency of NKTs co-expressing CAR.CD19 and LEF1 in pre-clinical B cell lymphoma models. The
ongoing and proposed studies are the first to rigorously evaluate the utility of NKTs as a novel cellular platform
for redirected “off-the-self” immunotherapy. If proven to be safe and effective, this approach will provide a
foundation for a cost-effective cell therapy platform for B-NHL and perhaps other types of cancer as well."

10926919,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this project we will improve the outcome and the accessibility of adoptive cell therapy with engineered CD5-
specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells in patients with refractory or relapsed T-cell lymphoma (r/r TCL).
These studies build on the promising results obtained in the Phase I clinical trial funded in the previous SPORE,
where autologous CD5 CAR T-cells produced robust clinical responses in 44% of patients with recalcitrant TCL,
enabling three out of nine patients to proceed with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
These responses were achieved by CAR T-cell products enriched for minimally differentiated T-cell subsets. We
will now overcome the remaining barriers to success and accessibility identified from our previous study, namely
the rapid loss of potency of ex vivo expanded CD5 CAR T-cells induced by tonic CAR signaling, low frequency
and poor fitness of patient-derived T-cells, and rapid disease progression due to lengthy manufacturing of
autologous cell products. We will use several complementary strategies to improve the clinical potency of CD5
CAR T-cell products and to enable patients to rapidly receive these products as banked (off the shelf) cells. In
clinical studies in Aim 1, we use pharmacologic inhibitors to reversibly inhibit tonic CAR signaling and the
resultant terminal differentiation of CD5 CAR T-cells during cGMP manufacturing, and evaluate CD5 CAR T-
cells generated from HSCT (i.e. normal) donors for patients whose disease relapsed after allogeneic HSCT. We
predict these improvements will preserve the beneficial undifferentiated T-cell subsets and thus improve
expansion and anti-lymphoma activity of CD5 CAR T-cell products; this hypothesis is supported by our early
clinical data. To further maximize clinical potency of CD5 CAR T-cells and expedite treatment of patients with
rapidly progressing disease, in Aim 2 we will develop banked CD5 CAR T-cells for off-the-shelf therapy.
Leveraging our latest preclinical findings, we will engineer these CD5 CAR T-cells to eliminate alloreactivity
(using TCR gene editing) and resist host immune rejection, by arming them with a novel alloimmune defense
receptor, ADR. These modifications should ensure the safety and functional persistence of allogeneic CD5 CAR
T-cells in patients. We will manufacture and bank highly potent, ADR-armed TCR-edited CD5 CAR T-cells in
Aim 3 and initiate a Phase I clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant TCL. Overall, these studies should
provide a safe and effective cell therapy for patients with r/r T-cell lymphoma who have few alternative options."
10926922,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The broad goal of Project 3 is to devise and implement novel strategies of effective, low-toxicity EBV-specific T
cell (EBVST) therapy for EBV-positive lymphomas; approximately 30% of all human lymphomas. The lymphoma
environment lacks the positive signaling required to maintain the anti-tumor activities of EBVSTs and instead
expresses inhibitory signals producing EBVST anergy. Our constitutive interleukin 7 receptor (C7R) not only
provides intrinsic cytokine signaling but activates an anti-apoptotic program that provides resistance to tumor
induced T-cell dysfunction. C7R produced expansion of GD2.CAR T-cells that was similar to lymphodepleting
chemotherapy (LD) in patients with neuroblastoma, and unlike LD, did not induce cytokine release syndrome
(CRS). C7R expression in EBVSTs produced more rapid clearance of autologous EBV-transformed B-cell
tumors in an NSG xenograft model and in Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that C7R will enhance the
expansion and persistence of EBVSTs in patients with lymphoma, will provide resistance to the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and provide a non-toxic alternative to LD.
EBV-reactivation produces exponential expansion of infused autologous EBVSTs and tumor clearance in
patients with EBV+ lymphoma. In Aim 2 we will clinically evaluate an EBV latency reversal agent, panobinostat
(PBST) to enhance the expansion and function of C7R-EBVSTs. PBST also has direct anti-lymphoma activity
by downregulating STAT5 and increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic caspases. These inhibitory activities
will be counteracted in EBVSTs by the C7R that upregulates STAT5. Thus, our second hypothesis (Aim 2) is
that PBST will simultaneously increase antigen stimulation of C7R-EBVST while selectively increasing
susceptibility of the tumor cells to C7R-EBVST killing.
The ideal therapy for EBV+ lymphoma would be off-the-shelf, partially-HLA matched C7R-EBVSTs that are
potent, immediately available, and relatively inexpensive. However, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and graft
rejection caused by alloreactive T-cells curtail the clinical efficacy of allogeneic cell therapies. Aim 3 will evaluate
CD30.CAR-modified C7R-EBVSTs to resolve both problems, EBVSTs have not produced GVHD in hundreds of
allogeneic recipients in the stem cell transplant setting, and since alloactivated T-cells upregulate CD30, they
should be eliminated by the CD30.CAR. Indeed banked CD30.CAR-EBVSTs have safely produced clinical
responses (3 complete), in 6 of 8 patients with CD30+lymphoma. However, CD30.CAR-EBVSTs did not persist.
Hence Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that C7R will enhance CD30.CAR-EBVST persistence and anti-tumor
activity in a murine allo-rejection model. These 3 hypotheses will be tested in the three specific Aims:
Aim 1. Can C7R enhance expansion, and long-term activity of EBVSTs in patients with EBV+ lymphoma?
Aim 2. Can panobinostat boost EBVST expansion and anti-tumor activity in patients?
Aim 3. Can CD30.CAR prevent rejection of C7R-EBVSTs in a murine allo-rejection model?"

L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine. The Regulatory Affairs
component collaborates with investigators to develop and submit all required regulatory documents, including
initial and revised submissions to the IRB, IBC, and FDA and the subsequent annual reports and adverse
event notifications as required. This core has extensive experience with IND submissions, successfully
submitting over 100 studies of complex biological agents on over 50 INDs: the completed studies have
enrolled over 1200 patients. The Study Co-ordination group arranges meetings of investigators, attending
physicians, research nurses and data managers; provides training on the standard operating procedures
(SOPs) for each protocol; and offers research coordinator support to ensure that clinical studies are conducted
safely, accurately and efficiently to GCP standards using the OnCore clinical trials management system. The
QC program will ensure that the standard operating procedures for protocol development, conduct of clinical
trials, data collection and management of clinical trials are followed. The QA program will audit each study
after the first patient is enrolled; subsequent audits are held in a randomized way to ensure that studies follow
Good Clinical Practices. Data Safety monitoring is provided through the DLDCCC Data Review Committee or
external DSMB operating under an NCI-approved data safety monitoring plan, which is responsible for
reviewing and evaluating toxicity and any other study-relevant safety-related data for clinical research studies.
Finally, the core provides comprehensive and centralized biostatistical support to projects including study
design, data analysis and data management for preclinical and clinical studies. Centralized biostatistical
support facilitates efficient use of these services and promotes collaboration between biostatisticians and
investigators in the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation of results for all projects. This ensures the
conduct of high-quality projects that incorporate appropriate and state-of-the-art statistical methods from their
design to their analysis."

More efficient processes for drug development make possible new effective therapies for rare cancers that have
unmet clinical needs. In the pharmaceutical industry, narrowing from 10,000 or more possible chemical entities
hits to a single FDA approved drug could take 11-16 years and cost $1-2B for that single drug. The earliest
stages of this process are Research & Development (R&D) and then Preclinical Research with animals. The
US expenditures for R&D and preclinical processes are $26B annually, equating to $474M per FDA-approved
drug. The first R&D step is fast and automated, but preclinical animal studies are comparatively slower and
more expensive. But what if R&D could “preview” animal studies and only refer the most promising compounds
for Preclinical research with mammalian models? We hypothesize that pharma can forego much of the
expense of failed mouse studies by pushing animal studies earlier into the discovery phase using our
shell-free quail xenograft assay – an assay that can be executed in a standard laboratory instead of a
vivarium, without the regulatory need for IACUC oversight and as a simple hardware + bioware Kit. To
product-engineer & streamline our proof of concept, easy-to use Kit, we will: (Aim 1A) Refine and test a CAM
Assay Hardware Product Line by optimizing throughput in restricting use of quail eggs of a specific weight
range we will determine; and comparing durability of an egg-cracking device manufactured with environmentally-
friendly materials versus aluminum. Completing this aim, we will achieve proof of concept for an optimized
hardware component of our kit. We will also: Aim 1B. Develop and test a prototype CAM Assay Bioware
Kit product line by developing a Bioware kit with shipping-safe, temperature appropriate packaging; refining
the assay protocol with careful attention to user time and total time required. A special effort will be made to
simplify the placement of the drug-delivery beads; defining reproducibility of the kit within an experiment and for
the same experiment across different weeks using a drug range dose-response experiment for a cancer cell line
xenograft; benchmarking the throughput for an experienced user vs a beginner user. Completing these sub-
aims, will have documented performance for a proof of concept bioware kit to be brought to beta-testing for drug
lead validation in early pharmaceutical R&D labs investigating cancer therapeutics."
10915821,"ABSTRACT
Over the past three decades, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of childhood obesity.
Childhood obesity leads to early onset of cardiovascular risk factors, and both obesity and cardiovascular risk
factors track into adulthood and contribute to the epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Developmental
Origins of Health and Disease theory posits that risk for obesity and CVD is, in part, programmed in utero. To
prevent this early entrenchment into obesity and CVD, identification of modifiable maternal factors during
pregnancy that later impact offspring risk in early childhood is essential. A surprising lack of research investigates
the role of prenatal sedentary behavior (SED), moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), and the
novel 24-hour behavior paradigm (the composition of SED, physical activity, and sleep) on these adverse
offspring outcomes. This is a critical research gap because there is strong physiological rationale that SED,
MVPA, and 24-hour behavior in pregnancy could influence offspring health, and these behaviors are modifiable
targets for intervention during pregnancy. The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the associations of SED
(Aim 1) and MVPA (Aim 2) across pregnancy with offspring obesity risk and CVD risk through 24 months. We
will also use novel statistical methods to determine the optimal 24-hour behavior compositions (Aim 3) during
pregnancy associated with reduced risk of these adverse offspring outcomes. We can achieve these aims by
leveraging our ongoing, multi-center cohort study Pregnancy 24/7 (R01 HL153095), where we are prospectively
measuring SED, physical activity, and sleep in 500 women in each trimester of pregnancy using state-of-the-art
monitors (activPAL3 micro and Actiwatch Spectrum Plus). Pregnancy 24/7 also assesses other relevant prenatal
exposures that may associate with offspring obesity and CVD risk, i.e., pre-pregnancy obesity, gestational weight
gain, diet, smoking, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In direct response to the NHLBI’s Notice of Special
Interest (NOT-HL-19-695), we propose to expand Pregnancy 24/7 by conducting a separate cohort study among
the offspring of its participants. In the Offspring Study, we propose to combine maternal exposure data from
Pregnancy 24/7 with new, comprehensive assessments of postnatal exposures, obesity, and CVD risk measures
in the child through 24 months via medical record abstraction, questionnaires, and an in-person study visit at 24
months. We hypothesize that offspring of women with higher SED or lower MVPA across pregnancy will have
more rapid increases in BMI Z-score (primary outcome), and greater adiposity, blood pressure, and pulse wave
velocity through 24 months. Further, we hypothesize that statistically reallocating time in SED to physical activity,
but not sleep (among adequate duration sleepers) will be associated with more optimal offspring outcomes. By
combining prenatal and postnatal exposure data, our approach uniquely allows us to isolate the effects of
pregnancy SED, MVPA, and 24-hr behavior on offspring obesity and CVD risk measures in early childhood. This
project will inform critically needed primordial prevention interventions to decrease the risk of obesity and CVD."
10916306,"Project 1 Summary/Abstract
Combining immunotherapy with other therapy regimens, particularly targeted therapy, is a highly active area of
exploration with the goal of improving anti-tumor efficacy and extending therapeutic benefits to more patients or
tumor types. As the first mutation-immune co-targeted therapy, the simultaneous combination of anti-PD-L1 with
BRAFV600MUT and MEK inhibitors (so-called “triplet” therapy) has been approved for patients with BRAFV600MUT
melanoma. However, the data on this triplet appear mixed, with other trials not meeting key endpoints,
suggesting that simultaneous combination is not optimal. Our recent work in syngeneic murine melanoma
models showed uniformly, across tumor models of distinct driver mutations and cancer histologies, that a
regimen of 1-week anti-PD-1/L1 (± anti-CTLA-4) pretreatment augments the efficacy of triplet therapy by
enhancing MAPKi durability and dramatically suppressing melanoma brain metastasis. The improved therapy
efficacy resulted from the promotion of pro-inflammatory polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the
elicitation of robust T cell clonal expansion and clonotypic convergence within the tumor-immune
microenvironment (TIME) induced by the anti-PD-1/L1 lead-in. This is consistent with observations in the clinical
trial data that prior immunotherapy before MAPKi is associated with improved progression-free survival. These
results highlight the vital role of the sequence/timing of each therapy component in the rational design of
combination therapies and also point to the need for a mechanistic understanding of the early-stage impact of
each combinatorial therapy component on the TIME.
However, the design of such sequential combination therapy trials is challenging because of the sheer number
of variables (sequence order, dosing, and timing) to be tested. The level of complexity calls for a predictive
framework to significantly reduce the parameter space and inform the identification of effective sequential
immunotherapy-targeted inhibitor combinations. Herein, we hypothesize that a spatiotemporal, multi-omics
analysis of early-stage (few days) monotherapy-induced changes in the TIME can provide deep insights
for greatly simplifying the design of immunotherapy-targeted inhibitor sequential combination trials. The
goal of Project 1 is to provide a data set that can be mined to inform the design of effective sequential combination
regimens. We will leverage state-of-the-art, spatial multi-omics tissue profiling tools to build a spatiotemporal
“movie” of the evolving TIME in established syngeneic melanoma tumor models, and their associated brain
metastases, after treatment with each of the combinatorial therapy components. The resultant spatiotemporal
multi-omic data will be analyzed to extract a number of highly informative TIME features from which agent-based
models (Project 2) for predicting effective sequential combination regimens can be constructed. Retrospective
studies of clinical tumor biopsies are proposed to validate the model findings."
10916309,"Project 2 Project Summary
Cutaneous melanoma became an early example for treatment with targeted therapy with the clinical
development of the first BRAFV600MUT-specific inhibitor (BRAFi), vemurafenib1. Resistance to BRAFi is common2,
and was initially ascribed to cancer cell intrinsic factors that reactivate MAPK pathway signaling3–7. BRAFi in
combination with MEKi8 was developed to combat such resistance, but only a quarter of patients treated with
this combination survive for five years9. In fact, recent data suggest that cancer cell-extrinsic factors, including
immune factors3,10–13, can play important roles in resistance development to MAPK pathway inhibitors, thus
highlighting the role of the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). Strikingly, in syngeneic melanoma models
that develop resistance against both MAPKi and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), lead-in ICB can ‘prime’
both the primary tumor and distal metastases for eradication when the ICB is subsequently combined with
MAPKi14. While this suggests that immune based strategies, such as ICB or adoptive cell therapy (ACT), can
serve as sequential combinatorial agents to prevent MAPKi resistance. However, it also significantly complicates
the design of candidate treatment regimens, since multiple sequences and sequence timings need to be tested.
This can make clinical trials design impractical. We propose to develop methods that apply iterative and active
learning to deep phenotyping with spatial and temporal multi-omics assays to yield predictive in silico models
that can provide guidance for designing sequential immunotherapy - targeted inhibitor combination therapies. .
A key element of Project 2 is the iterative development of multiscale Agent Based Models (ABMs) as a virtual
representation of the TIME. ABMs are initially constructed from existing data, including preliminary results from
biobanked tumor specimens and public omics data bases, and from our extensive experience within the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). They are then evolved through a systems biology-inspired iterative cycle of quantitative
experimentation, analysis, modeling, and validation, drawing from experimental data from both Projects 1 and 2."
10916312,"Outreach. Project Summary.
The ST-Analytics scientific program is designed to take a systems biology approach towards addressing the
question of how to effectively administer targeted-inhibitor – immunotherapy sequential combinations for the
treatment of solid tumors, with an emphasis on melanoma. ST Analytics incorporates state-of-the-art
experimental and computational programs advancing in close feedback with each other towards a robust
solution. The ST-Analytics Outreach Program is designed as a highly complementary program, with STEM
outreach goals that are aligned with the core scientific theme of the U54. The Outreach program takes advantage
of ISB’s ‘Systems Education Experiences’ teacher Educational Programs that promote systems approaches to
scientific problem solving through the development of educational modules that have provided positive STEM
learning experiences for millions of students worldwide, and in each of the 50 states. A strong emphasis is
placed on providing systems immuno-oncology internships and experiences to student populations traditionally
under-represented in the STEM fields. The basic approach is to integrate these interns with ST-Analytics
researchers to incorporate systems immuno-oncology concepts into two existing or in-development educational
modules, entitled Systems Medicine Module 3 - Personalizing Disease Treatments, and Gaining Insight through
Systems Thinking and Computational Modeling. While those modules are designed to meet Next Generation
Science Standards (NGSS), the professional educators who are tasked with implementing those standards often
do not have the proper background or supporting materials for the job. Thus, our outreach programs are also
designed to provide that background and support. For example, we provide research-based, reality-driven
professional development for more than 1,000 teachers and 80 district administrators annually, impacting over
two-thirds of students in Washington. Thus, the potential impact of an ST-Analytics outreach program is large,
and is achieved by leveraging extensive existing resources and relationships that extend throughout the state of
WA and up and down the U.S. west coast. A program that solicits creative engagement from all participants
within our proposed U54 program at all levels is described."
10916316,"Core 2. Imaging and Spatial Profiling Core Project Summary:
Central technologies of the ST-Analytics U54 program are tissue imaging and profiling platforms, including two
sets of tools for highly multiplex, multi-omic analysis of tumor tissue specimens including clinical archival FFPE
and lightly preserved frozen tissues, and associated image analysis & informatics software. These Core
resource technologies are used extensively by both ST Analytics Projects.
 The first spatial profiling tool is the well-established commercial Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP)
system, which permits analysis of regions of interest (ROIs) containing as few as 10-20 cells for detecting around
1000 genes or around 50 proteins (Lee 2017, Lu 2021). Adjacent slices from an FFPE block are prepared. The
first is subjected to H&E staining for pathological analysis, while the second is stained with fluorescent antibodies
to identify ROIs (for example, immune cell rich or cancer cell rich regions). Those ROIs are then interrogated at
the transcriptome or proteome level. We have extensive experience with this tool for analysis of FFPE preserved
patient tumor tissues (Lu 2021).
 The second profiling tools are those recently developed and reported by the Fan group (Deng 2021,
2021, Liu 2020). These powerful tools permit highly multiplex (up to 300-plex) proteomics and genome--wide
transcriptome mapping at a resolution of 10 micrometers in tissue slices prepared from FFPE blocks. They also
permit spatially resolved ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq type epigenetic profiling (Chen 2017; Chen 2018) at a similar
spatial resolution in lightly fixed tissue slices. In particular, this epigenetic profiling capacity is unique to these
tools. Similar to DSP, adjacent tissue slices can be H&E stained, and low-plex fluorescent imaging can be
employed on the same slice for identification of nuclei as well as immune rich and immune poor regions for
alignment validation. These methods can enable high throughput and cost-effective profiling of tissues, and
some technology development to that end is described. The Core will continue to develop new spatial profiling
tools to meet the emergent needs in the two projects as they advance in the next 5 years, thus serving as a
Technoloy Innovation Hub for the U54 center and for the CSBC consortium as well."

10916326,"The impact of sleep dysregulation on Autism Spectrum Disorder: Abstract
As many as 80% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience sleep disruptions. These
are among the most burdensome symptoms reported by parents of children with ASD. Insufficient
subjective sleep quality is associated with exacerbated severity of core ASD symptoms, including
repetitive behaviors, social and communication difficulties. However, the few objective sleep PSG
studies have not found significant effects. This likely reflects the small number of studies that utilized
PSG as an objective sleep measure, small sample sizes, or assessment in a laboratory setting rather
than in the child's home environment. Our own investigation of a larger sample using sleep PSG in
ASD subjects, in their home, found an increased SWS ratio in ASD and a lower REM sleep ratio
compared to typically developing (TD) children and adolescents. To address the critical question of
whether dysregulated sleep is central to the development and symptoms of ASD, we will test for
differences in sleep fragmentation (actigraphy), sleep architecture (PSG) and daytime, awake, resting
state EEG, in 150 individuals with ASD and 75 age and sex-matched TD controls, age 4-17. We will
examine if any observed sleep dysregulation is associated with the core symptoms, repetitive
behaviors, and cognitive function of ASD. We will also examine if sleep impairments are associated
with dysregulated daytime, resting state EEG in ASD compared to TD. In collaboration with Project 2,
we will examine if target engagement-induced normalization of sleep positively impacts these
symptoms. In collaboration with Projects 3 and 4, we will examine if the hypothesized impairments in
sleep fragmentation, sleep architecture and daytime awake, resting state EEG in ASD will be
recapitulated in our animal experiments of sleep in genetic models of ASD and if normalization of sleep
fragmentation, sleep architecture and daytime awake, resting EEG in our animal models of ASD will be
associated with improved social communication and cognition, and reduced repetitive behaviors in
these animal models. If we demonstrate that sleep fragmentation is responsible for the development of
some ASD traits and sleep normalization alleviates them, we will have demonstrated the potential
causality and importance of sleep in ASD."
10912067,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal solid tumor that is highly dependent on recruitment of new blood 
vessels and has no common genomic targets. As for most solid tumors, metastasis causes a disproportionate 
degree of morbidity and mortality. LIN28B – an RNA-binding protein expressed in tumors and in developing 
tissues – is essential for HCC development and elevated LIN28B expression in HCC correlates with an increased 
risk of death. We recently identified LIN28B as a novel driver of pancreatic cancer metastasis and propose in 
Aim 1 to use an integrated series of molecular, cellular, and animal experiments to determine if HCC metastasis 
is driven by LIN28B. In Aim 2, I propose to couple robust co-culture (HCC cell and endothelial cell) in vitro and 
in vivo models to define how LIN28B expression in HCC cells modulates its effect on endothelial cells, which in 
turn stimulate the HCC metastatic phenotype. In Aim 3, I will utilize our expertise in novel circulating tumor cell 
purification/analysis technologies and computational analysis of conventional and novel tissue staining 
technologies to characterize the metastasis-driving and endothelial regulatory roles of LIN28B using primary 
human circulating tumor cell and tumor tissue specimens. Collectively, this work will provide functional rationale
for the development of new therapies targeting the LIN28B pathway and linked vascular-regulatory pathways in 
HCC and for the development of novel matched biomarkers. The applicant, Dr. Joseph Franses, is an oncologist 
at the University of Chicago Cancer Center. He will spend 75% of his time performing translational research and 
25% in clinical practice caring for patients with cancer. He has outlined a five-year career development plan to 
meet his goal of becoming an independent investigator in translational research. Dr. Franses has assembled an 
Advisory Committee of internationally recognized experts to provide scientific and career mentorship. He has 
established collaborations with experts in cancer genomics, molecular biology, tumor animal modeling, and 
computational biology to provide experimental advice and specific training in the field. Dr. Franses will conduct 
this research and leverage the exceptional research and teaching environment at the University of Chicago 
Cancer Center. The University of Chicago harbors an outstanding research community and has a long track 
record for successful mentorship of independent physician-scientists. This will be an ideal environment for 
successful completion of these experiments and the realization of Dr. Franses’ career goal of becoming an 
independent physician-scientist dedicated to improving the care of patients with gastrointestinal cancers."
10918113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) are disproportionately represented throughout the criminal justice
system, the vast majority of whom are on probation and parole. Implementing evidence-based practices to
address the needs of justice-involved people with SMI requires an understanding of the multilevel factors that
impact intervention implementation in both the mental health and criminal justice systems and the expertise to
address these factors. Dr. Tonya Van Deinse’s proposed K01 training plan and research study, under the
expert guidance of an NIH-funded mentoring team, will provide her with intensive substantive and
methodological training and research experience to become a leading expert in implementing complex, cross-
agency interventions to address the needs of justice-involved people with SMI. Specialty mental health
probation (SMHP) is an evidence-informed intervention that aims to engage people with SMI in treatment and
divert them from the criminal justice system. Although high-fidelity SMHP can increase mental health and
substance use service engagement, improve mental health symptoms, and reduce rates of rearrest, jail days
and probation violations, effective implementation of SMHP is context-dependent and relies on inter-
organizational relationships between SMHP officers and mental health service providers. Specifically, SMHP
requires officers to increase treatment linkage and resource coordination and serve as boundary spanners who
bridge the interagency coordination and collaboration gap between probation officers and mental health
service providers. Given the importance of inter-organizational relationships in implementing SMHP, it is
necessary to assess the multilevel factors that impact its cross-agency implementation context and to develop
implementation strategies to enhance inter-organizational relationships. This proposal adapts an existing
implementation approach to enhance probation officers’ capacity for coordination, collaboration, and linking
probationers with SMI to treatment. This adapted implementation approach, to be called Networking to Engage
in Treatment: Working within Officer-Resource Collaboratives (NETWORC), will be developed and tested via
the following aims: (1) identify multi-level factors that inhibit SMHP officers’ capacity to link individuals with SMI
to treatment providers; (2) conduct a process evaluation of the NETWORC implementation approach; and (3)
evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the collaborative implementation toolkit.
Findings from this study will provide preliminary data about the feasibility and efficacy of the adapted
implementation strategy and will be used to develop Dr. Van Deinse’s subsequent R01, a pragmatic cluster
randomized trial using multilevel analyses to examine the impact of the implementation strategy on
probationer, officer, and inter-organizational levels."
10918300,"Summary
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in American men. Early-stage PCa
can be effectively ablated with surgery and/or radiation treatments. However, metastatic PCa remains a
challenge, and the standard treatment is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, a majority of PCa
patients develop resistance to ADT over a period of months to years, ultimately resulting in castration-resistant
PCa (CRPC) and widespread aggressive tumors. The mechanisms for this resistance are not fully understood,
but it has been shown that aggressive PCa tumors accumulate lipid droplets for fueling metastatic progression.
Thus, a key to overcoming ADT is to identify the driver genes of tumor metastasis, such as lipogenesis genes,
which may be promising targets for therapeutic intervention and a long-term cure. In preliminary studies, we
found that HOXB13, a prostate-specific homeodomain-containing transcription factor, is down-regulated in
CRPC as compared to primary PCa, and we found a previously uncharacterized role of HOXB13 in
transcriptional repression of lipogenesis. We identify a novel HOXB13-interacting protein, the histone
deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which closes target chromatin for gene repression. Of note, this interaction is
disrupted by HOXB13 G84E mutation that has been reported in familial PCa and associated with early-onset
PCa. Moreover, our data showed that HDAC3-regulated genes remarkably overlapped with HOXB13-regulated
genes. Like HOXB13, HDAC3 inhibits lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), and this is
accompanied by the removal of acetylation on key histones at target genes. Hence, our central hypothesis is
that HOXB13 recruits HDAC3 to repress lipogenic gene expression through epigenetic remodeling and that
FASN inhibitors (FASNi) will be effective in treating CRPC with low or G84E-mutant HOXB13. To test these
hypotheses, Aim 1 will examine the molecular mechanisms by which HOXB13 interacts and recruits HDAC3
protein to target chromatin to catalyze histone de-acetylation and repress lipogenic gene expression. We will
also investigate how this HOXB13/HDAC3-mediated lipogenic program cross talks with AR, which plays a
major role in inducing lipid metabolism, and identify key downstream mediators in addition to FASN. Aim 2 will
examine the protein levels of HOXB13 and its key target genes in human CRPC specimens, determine how
HOXB13 and its G84E mutant regulate prostate tumorigenesis using diverse PCa models, and evaluate the
efficacy of FASNi on prostate tumor growth and metastasis using HOXB13-low or -high xenograft and PDX
models."
10914101,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genetic testing is rapidly emerging as a cornerstone of medicine, enabling targeted therapies for patients with
both common and rare disorders, and empowering patients, families and communities with knowledge about
their condition. However, despite significant advances over the past decade, including the introduction of
clinical whole genome sequencing, clinical genetics remains largely limited to the study of less than 1% of the
genome, the exome. This limitation is thought to underlie the fact that clinical genomic sequencing is
unsuccessful in elucidating the culprit pathogenic variant(s) for the majority of patients with presumed
monogenic disorders who undergo testing. It is hypothesized that a significant percentage of these patients
harbor pathogenic non-coding variants that disrupt the gene regulatory architecture of known Mendelian
genes, a class of variants poorly illuminated using current sequencing approaches. Directly addressing this
limitation requires a wholesale revision of how genetic testing is performed and interpreted, as is outlined in
this proposal. Specifically, this proposal aims to overcome this fundamental limitation of human genetics by
leveraging a novel approach we recently developed for simultaneously mapping the genetic and epigenetic
landscape of a sample, thereby illuminating the functional impact of non-coding genetic variants that disrupt
local chromatin architecture and gene regulatory patterns – Whole Epi-Genome Sequencing (WEGS). Using
this approach, we plan to directly test the hypothesis that rare non-coding genetic alterations contribute to
monogenic disorders. In Aim 1, we will use the WEGS approach to characterize the gene regulatory impact of
non-coding sequence, structural and epigenetic alterations in healthy individuals as well as patients with known
imprinting disorders. The goal of this aim is to establish the sensitivity and power of WEGS for identifying
genetic variants that disrupt local chromatin architecture and gene regulatory patterns and improve our
understanding of the functional impact of non-coding genetic variation. In Aim 2, we will directly evaluate the
contribution of rare non-coding genetic alterations to monogenic disorders by applying WEGS to patients with
suspected monogenic disorders for whom whole exome or genome sequencing has previously been non-
diagnostic. Overall, this proposal has the potential to dramatically change how we approach genomic testing
and our understanding of the impact of non-coding sequence and structural variation on gene regulatory
patterns and human disease."
10914102,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disorder with adverse neurocognitive and cardio-metabolic
outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard therapeutic option to treat airway
obstructions during sleep and thus, prevent its adverse cardiovascular and neurocognitive outcomes. Previous
clinical trials, however, have largely failed to show a consistent impact of CPAP on these health outcomes.
One of the main limitations of these trials is, we believe, inadequate characterization of OSA and its acute
physiological consequences. By characterizing OSA based on the “apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)”, there is a
potential risk of negative results. We surmise that, by better characterization of OSA-related physiological
consequences during sleep, we will be able to identify individuals at high risk for these adverse outcomes and
those who would benefit most from therapy. We have developed physiologically driven metrics to capture the
precise burden of OSA-related hypoxemia (“hypoxic burden”), autonomic response (“heart rate burden”), and
sleep fragmentation (“arousal burden”). Our preliminary data from large observational studies suggest that these
metrics outperform conventional sleep study parameters.
In Aim 1, we seek to demonstrate that OSA patients with high hypoxic burden will exhibit greater improvements,
after 12 weeks of CPAP therapy, in endothelial function (flow-mediated vasodilation) and oxidative stress
markers than those with a low hypoxic burden. In Aim 2, we will investigate how heart rate burden determines
the reduction in 24-hour mean blood pressure after 12 weeks of CPAP treatment. Finally, in Aim 3, we will seek
to demonstrate that OSA patients with larger degrees of sleep fragmentation, quantified by arousal burden, will
respond more favorably to CPAP, in terms of improvement in daytime sleepiness and attention, than those with
low arousal burden. While the primary analysis will be the change in these outcomes after 12 weeks of CPAP,
we will also assess these outcomes at 4 weeks to examine their time course. A total of 158 men and women
with apnea-hypopnea index ≥15 events/hour will receive CPAP for 12 weeks. Adherence to therapy will be
carefully monitored and encouraged by regular phone calls and in-person visits. Adverse events will also be
closely monitored and recorded.
Overall, our proposal is expected to demonstrate that prognostic markers of OSA that more strongly link with
health outcomes will not only improve the diagnosis of OSA, but also provide a physiological basis for identifying
those individuals most responsive to CPAP therapy. These results will have key mechanistic implications for
“individualized medicine” in OSA by focusing on subgroups of patients who would most benefit from CPAP
therapy. This personalized medicine approach will provide the scientific knowledge needed to progress towards
larger studies in selected patients. Such results are of major importance because they have great potential to
improve the quality of life and health outcomes of patients with OSA."
10914105,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The California Teachers Study (CTS) has collected high-quality and detailed exposure, biospecimens, cancer,
and clinical endpoint data on 133,477 female volunteers followed since 1995. The cancers, hospitalizations,
and deaths to date are less than half of the total endpoints projected to occur in the CTS over the next 30
years. In the next 5 years, CTS follow-up will include over 37,000 cancers; 455,000 hospitalizations; and
41,000 deaths. This provides a solid foundation for collaborative research using these unique resources. Since
2013, the CTS collected new blood samples from 14,674 participants. Cloud computing and integrated mobile
devices generated rich phenotype data and exceptionally low pre-analytical variability for 488,000 aliquots that
are being stored as CTS follow-up continues. Since 2015, the CTS modernized its data collection, storage, and
analysis infrastructure by implementing a secure data warehouse and flexible analytics environment designed
for high-quality and integrated epidemiologic analysis. The CTS includes secure user authentication &
authorization; a collaborative workspace with documents, data visualizations, tools, and workflows; metadata;
application programming interface (API) capabilities; and a scalable data model. The CTS is now positioned to
streamline its resources for long-term sustainability. The goals of this competing renewal are to preserve
existing resources that enable research and strategically expand areas that create high-value opportunities.
First, we will maintain existing CTS data and extend passive follow-up through efficient cancer, hospitalization,
and mortality linkages. These ongoing linkages will generate additional endpoints used for future etiologic,
consortial, aging, and other research. Second, we will store the 488,000 high-quality biospecimens collected
since 2013. These specimens are all currently available to everyone; ongoing storage will ensure that they
remain available to everyone. Third, we will expand capacity by integrating additional targeted geospatial data
on climate, extreme weather, built environment, community characteristics, health access, environmental
exposures, social vulnerability, and community resilience. The new CTS infrastructure efficiently enables
everyone, regardless of their GIS expertise, to rigorously incorporate individual-level geospatial exposures into
their analyses. Fourth, because most participants are now over age 65, we will link the CTS with Medicare
outpatient data to complement existing data and expand infrastructure for aging, survivorship, comorbidity, and
health services research. The recent CTS infrastructure updates added research-ready efficiencies to manage
and process complex geospatial, administrative claims, and other CTS data in ways that help all researchers,
especially those outside the CTS, conduct integrative, rigorous, and reproducible research. The CTS is an
innovation leader with primed assets and decades of promising future research potential. This competing
renewal will maintain high-value CTS resources that can address understudied research areas, facilitate
broader use by the entire scientific community, and streamline the CTS for long-term sustainability."
10914500,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT FROM PARENT GRANT
Approximately 1 in 7 women experience perinatal depression (i.e., during pregnancy or the postpartum period),
making it the most common complication of childbirth. Perinatal depression is associated with long-lasting
consequences, including increased risk of suicide, impairments in parenting, and immense societal costs.
Prenatal insomnia is a robust risk factor for perinatal depression: nearly 1 in 4 women who experience prenatal
insomnia develop postpartum depression. To date, depression prevention interventions mainly focus on
pregnant women with elevated depressive symptoms or a history of depression, and no trials have investigated
whether treating prenatal insomnia prevents perinatal depression. Digital cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) is
safe and effective for treating prenatal insomnia and shows promise for preventing perinatal depression
relative to standard care. Further, digital CBT-I may be of particular interest for pregnant women because it
minimizes wait time, avoids burdensome traveling and scheduling requirements, and meets their preferences
for flexible delivery options. The proposed project is a blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
efficacy of digital CBT-I for the prevention of depression during pregnancy and through 12 months postpartum
among 498 non-depressed women with insomnia disorder relative to a credible, clinically-relevant control
condition. Consistent with other research, sleep hygiene education will be the control condition, and will match
digital CBT-I in delivery format (digital), frequency (weekly), and number of sessions (six). The proposed
confirmatory efficacy trial addresses three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the efficacy of digital CBT-I for
preventing perinatal depression; 2) To test whether the effect of digital CBT-I on perinatal depression is
mediated through prenatal insomnia symptom improvement; 3) To test whether the effect of digital CBT-I on
perinatal depression is moderated by baseline depressive symptom severity. By focusing on a low stigma
target (i.e., prenatal insomnia) and using a scalable intervention, this approach has the potential to facilitate
broad dissemination. The proposed project has high public health significance for reducing the burden of
perinatal depression for mothers, families, and society."

 We propose to develop a new technology pathway towards 1.5 GHz 1H NMR, by building a 28.2 T (1.2 GHz
1H)/1ppm, all-superconducting NMR demonstrator magnet using coils of the High-Temperature Superconductors
(HTS) Bi-2212 (Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox) and Bi-2223 ((Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3Ox) nested inside an existing wide-bore, 12 T
Low-Temperature Superconductor (LTS) magnet. The novelty of our proposal is that the primary HTS conductor
technology will be Bi-2212, made using a process we have developed with DOE High Energy Physics support.
In contrast to existing commercial HTS NMR magnet technology that is reliant on REBCO (REBa2Cu3O7-δ) tape
conductor, Bi-2212 is a round, genuinely multifilament and isotropic conductor that does not suffer from the very
large screening current induced stresses and error fields of the large width, single filament REBCO coated tape
conductors. It is also presently made in 3-4 times longer lengths than REBCO, making it more appropriate for
our long-term goal of creating magnets for 1.5 GHz 1H/ 35.3 T NMR spectroscopy, where 40-60% of the field
must be provided by the HTS insert magnets. To make our proposal compatible with R01 funding possibilities,
we pair two inner Bi-2212 coils with a larger diameter Bi-2223 coil as the HTS insert magnet. This strategy has
two advantages: (i) we have more than 2 km of Bi-2223 and more than 3 km of Bi-2212 conductor available
at no added cost to this project; and (ii) we can use the two HTS conductors to generate almost 60% of the
total field as would be needed for going to 1.5 GHz magnets. The following capabilities available at the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) enable the proposal: (a) A 212 mm bore, high-homogeneity LTS
magnet supported by the Oxford Instruments (OI) team that built it; (b) a unique over-pressure heat treatment
furnace (OPHT) facility for reaction of the Bi-2212 coils at the scale needed for NMR magnets; and (c) the
essential expertise of NHMFL scientists and engineers with experience building high field magnets and magnetic
resonance equipment for biological and biomedical applications. Successful demonstration of ultra-high-field
NMR technology will meet the aggressive challenge of 1.3-1.5 GHz NMR articulated by the 2013 National
Academy Panel assessing U.S. high magnetic field needs."
10924486,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pathologic descriptive diagnosis of glomerular scarring
(fibrosis). Many types of kidney injury including inherited mutations, drug toxicity, loss of nephron mass and
autoimmune diseases are associated with this pattern of injury. In some cases, termed primary FSGS, the
underlying insult is not identified. It is likely that a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors
is responsible for this disorder. However, progress in developing effective therapies for this common cause of
end-stage kidney disease has been hindered by a lack of understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms.
 There is compelling evidence that the intrauterine environment and post-natal growth can have significant
effects on kidney function and subsequent development of adult-onset disease. This process, known as
developmental programming, can have far-reaching implications for kidney, cardiovascular and metabolic
function. Significant risk factors of developmentally programmed chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HTN, such
as low birth weight and prematurity, are more common among African Americans, a population that is
disproportionately represented among veterans. A moderate reduction in nephron endowment, which is
typically clinically silent, is a risk factor for FSGS but is not sufficient to cause disease. Additional factors
(“second hits”) determine whether the kidney can adequately compensate for low nephron number or if
maladaptive structural and functional changes lead to disease. Post-natal growth and maturation of the kidney
play an important role in developmentally determined diseases because this period represents a window of
susceptibility to insults (“second hits”) causing permanent morphological changes and functional adaptation.
 Recent studies indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction during intrauterine and early post-natal growth may
be a common underlying mechanism for developmental programming of adult-onset diseases such as CKD
and HTN. We discovered that metastases associated protein 2 (Mta2), a core component of the Nucleosome
Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin-remodeling complex is a critical regulator of genes required
for mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism in the kidney. Deletion of Mta2 in the developing kidney leads to
a moderate reduction in nephron endowment (“first hit”). We posit that the nephrons that do form in the Mta2
mutant harbor epigenetic changes that persist and affect gene expression required for mitochondrial function
and lipid metabolism during post-natal growth and maturation of the kidney (“second hit”). Other metabolic
stressors, such as high fat diet, can also serve as a “second hit” in a susceptible kidney. As a result, the kidney
is incapable of meeting the metabolic and functional demands of post-natal life, leading to FSGS.
 We are using cutting edge technologies, such as Hi-ChIP and epigenomic editing, to test a novel paradigm
that the Mta2-NuRD complex significantly alters mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism defining new
mechanisms in the programming of adult-onset disease. Our research team has complimentary expertise in
kidney development and disease, gene regulation, cell metabolism and bioinformatic analysis of mutli-omic
data. Functional defects in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function during post-natal kidney development
will be examined to define biological processes that drive the development of adaptive (secondary) FSGS. We
will investigate how changes in genomic binding of NuRD and Zbtb7a/b in Mta2 mutants disrupts expression of
genes that regulate cell metabolism in glomeruli and proximal tubules during post-natal maturation of the
kidney. We will identify and functionally characterize genomic enhancers in mouse and human kidney relevant
to FSGS pathogenesis. These genome-wide data sets will be integrated with complementary multi-omics data
in human kidneys (PCEN, KPMP, Nephroseq, Trident) and be of significant value to other investigators in the
field. The long-term goal of our research is to identify early epigenetic events that trigger secondary FSGS
which are amenable to interventions that will prevent or substantially reduce the risk of this disease."
10924721,"Project Summary/Abstract
Delivery of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies with recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV) is
a promising approach for both, the prevention and treatment of HIV. Recombinant AAV has an outstanding safety
record in over 200 clinical trials and gene delivery mediated by AAV can result in continuous durable expression
of the transgene product. However, because of prior exposure to naturally circulating wild-type AAVs, a
significant portion of the human population has antibodies to the AAV capsid proteins in circulation. These
preexisting capsid antibodies can prevent cell transduction after recombinant AAV vector administration,
jeopardizing the applicability of this approach. To overcome this crucial issue, we propose a set of approaches
aimed at exerting a profound but transient depletion in vivo of circulating IgGs in AAV-positive macaques (Aim
1). AAV-mediated delivery of an anti-HIV antibody will then be assessed during such transient depletion. Our
goal is to obtain consistent and robust AAV-mediated delivery of anti-HIV antibodies with independence of the
capsid serostatus. If successful, the proposed strategies to overcome preexisting AAV antibodies could be a key
factor in the development of future AAV-gene delivery applications and more specifically in the fight against HIV.
By overcoming preexisting AAV capsid antibodies, we aim at making the AAV-delivery of antibodies a safe and
reliable approach against HIV. If satisfactory delivery methods are found, it becomes possible to envision a)
long-term control of the viral loads in the absence of antiretroviral treatment by delivering a combination of potent
and broadly neutralizing antibodies in people and b) long-lasting protection when this approach is used in a
prophylactic setting."
10924892,"Dr. Kimbrel is an experienced VA investigator with expertise in psychiatric genetics, suicide risk prediction,
nonsuicidal self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse. His program of research
utilizes a wide array of research methods (e.g., genetic epidemiology, machine learning, clinical observation,
ecological momentary assessment, clinical trials) to investigate the phenomenology of these conditions.
 Genetic Risk Factors for Suicide. Dr. Kimbrel has led many of the largest genetic studies of suicidal
thoughts and behaviors to date. His most recent study involved 633,778 Veteran participants and identified 16
novel genetic risk loci, including seven cross-ancestry risk loci. Nine additional ancestry-specific loci were also
identified. Dr. Kimbrel’s team also recently conducted the largest epigenome-wide association study of DNA
methylation in relation to suicide attempts to date. He is currently leading the largest genome-wide gene x
environment interaction study (GEWIS) of suicidal thoughts and behaviors to ever be attempted.
 Environmental Risk Factors for Suicide. Dr. Kimbrel is equally passionate about studying and identifying
environmental risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, having also led numerous studies aimed at
identifying how psychiatric complexity and different forms of traumatic stress (e.g., combat exposure, military
sexual trauma, childhood sexual trauma) contribute to risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors among
Veterans. More recently, his team has utilized sophisticated machine-learning approaches to study how
geospatial risk factors (e.g., altitude, rurality, social deprivation) contribute to suicide risk in Veterans.
 Improving Prediction of Acute Suicide Risk among Veterans. Dr. Kimbrel is presently MPI of four
federally-funded projects utilizing machine-learning techniques and/or novel data sources to improve prediction
of suicide risk among Veterans. To date, Dr. Kimbrel’s team has developed: (1) natural language processing
(NLP)-based approaches for extracting stressful life events and other suicide risk factors for Veterans from
healthcare notes; (2) NLP-based approaches for estimating prevalence of uncoded suicide attempts; (3)
continuous-time probabilistic models to handle longitudinal EHR data assessed inconsistently over time; and
(4) multiple AI-based models of risk for suicide attempts, suicide deaths, and all-cause mortality.
 Genetic and Environmental Contributions to PTSD and other Psychiatric Phenotypes. Dr. Kimbrel’s
research team has also studied the genetics of numerous other psychiatric phenotypes, including PTSD,
depression, substance use disorders, hippocampal subfield volume, and cortical surface area and thickness.
They are also actively involved in understanding how DNA methylation, gene expression, and various
measures of biological aging relate to psychiatric phenotypes. He has also led numerous investigations on
environmental contributions to PTSD and other forms of psychopathology, particularly the role that different
types of traumatic exposure may play in the pathogenesis of these conditions.
 Prediction and Prevention of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) among Veterans. Dr. Kimbrel is an
internationally-recognized authority on the subject of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among Veterans. His initial
work on this topic found that NSSI was remarkably common among Veterans, a finding that has now been
demonstrated in numerous other studies. His team has further demonstrated that NSSI is strongly associated
with suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and interpersonal violence among Veterans. His team was also
responsible for the development of the first and only validated measure of NSSI among Veterans.
 Cannabis Use among Veterans. Dr. Kimbrel has also led or else served as the senior author of four
separate studies demonstrating associations between cannabis use and suicide attempts among Veterans. His
current work in this area involves conducting a VA-funded study aimed at evaluating the impact of reduced
cannabis use on a variety of functional outcomes among Veterans with PTSD."

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a significant threat in the United States and developing
countries across the globe. Widely associated with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-c), therapeutic interventions are primarily focused on reduction of LDL-c plasma levels.
Despite the ability to therapeutically reach these target levels, many patients maintain high
cardiovascular risk profiles. A causal contributor to this therapeutic paradox is the development
of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and their metabolic remnants small dense LDL (sdLDL)
subclass, all of which are generated by lipolysis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)
remnants. Notably, increased levels of these highly atherogenic species have been attributed to
their content of Apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III), a protein that retards their plasma clearance due
to inhibition of lipolysis as well as interference with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated binding
and uptake by hepatic receptors, including heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) via syndecan
action and the LDL receptor (LDLR). Even though there is a limited understanding of sdLDL
vascular pathology, it is clear that elevation in these particles leads to significant CVD risk
despite patients achieving desired LDL-c reductions based on the current clinical guidelines. As
a potential solution, we are proposing the development of a novel therapeutic approach that
capitalizes on the excess of ApoC-III on these particles. This proof-of-concept Phase I work is
focused on sdLDL depletion, by reengineering iMBP-001, a proprietary ApoC-III antagonist, to
include bioactive ApoE memetic peptides. This dual domain therapeutic candidate can perform
highly specific particle recognition and binding through ApoC-III, but then facilitate sdLDL
particle clearance via LDL receptor (LDLR) and/or Heparin Sulfate Proteoglycan (HSPG)
syndecan uptake. This research program is to progressively narrow the candidate pipeline and
culminate in hepatic uptake feasibility testing. Uptake of purified human DiI sdLDL particles in
Hep G2 and primary hepatocyte cell lines will be evaluated. The milestone for this program is
the identification of at least one dual-domain candidate therapeutic molecule that demonstrates
a ≥ 5-fold increase in cellular uptake and a ≥ 10% reduction in Apolipoprotein B concentration in
the surrounding biological milieu versus controls. The satisfaction of this milestone would lead
to a SBIR Phase 2 application that would include further ApoE memetic peptide evaluation,
establishment of a scaled non-GMP manufacturing expression system and initiation of non-GLP
preclinical testing."
10926926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The three projects comprising this application use immune effector cells to treat lymphoma. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulations require that therapeutic cell populations must be manufactured under
current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Core C (Cell and Vector Production) will provide the
infrastructure necessary to meet this requirement. The cGMP facility at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy
consists of 22 ISO 7 clean rooms fully equipped for the preparation of cell and gene therapy products. Over
the last 23 years, our staff have manufactured more than 7,000 cellular therapy final products (and countless
intermediates), and >70 clinical grade viral vectors and master and working cell banks in support of more than
60 IND studies and international clinical protocols. During this period, the facility was designated as a National
Gene Vector Laboratory and as a National Somatic Cell Processing Facility under a contract from NHLBI
Production Assistance for Cellular Therapy (PACT) program. Manufacturing services are supported by a
dedicated specialized flow cytometry laboratory, which performs >13,000 tests annually; a quality control
laboratory performing in-house testing and environmental monitoring (>25,000 tests/year); and an
independent quality assurance group, which oversees compliance. The program is accredited by the
Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, the College of American Pathologists, and under the
Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments. The Cell and Vector Production facility is registered with the
FDA. In addition to manufacturing responsibilities, the Core staff are experienced in transitioning research
processes into GMP-compliant procedures and providing regulatory advice. This experience will be essential
in supporting the clinical components of this Lymphoma SPORE application."
10926927,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The purpose of this Biospecimen and Pathology Core is to provide tissue, cells and pathology services to the
three research projects and career enhancement, or research development awardees covered by this
application. To achieve these goals, the Lymphoma SPORE combines pathology resources from the Dan L
Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and its affiliated
institutions with those of Houston Methodist Hospital to ensure adequate numbers and timely delivery of
tissue/blood samples for the projected needs of SPORE and external investigators. The proposed core
resource will therefore co-ordinate acquisition of tissue for banking from lymphoma and CLL patients at
affiliated hospitals in the Texas Medical Center, by relying on established tissue collection and distribution
systems. The capacity to obtain samples from multiple affiliated hospitals will greatly increase the number of
specimens we are able to analyze, store and distribute from our diverse catchment area. The core also
provides pathology services including routine tissue preparation, immunohistochemical staining, laser capture
microdissection, preparation of tissue microarrays, flow cytometry, detection of minimal residual disease and
in situ hybridization for viral RNAs. These tasks are essential to the successful completion of planned
experiments in each project and will be performed by expert pathologists and histotechnologists with
substantial experience in providing core services to SPORE investigators. This core is also responsible for
coordinating supply of tissue to the Patient-Derived Xenograft and Advanced In Vivo Models Core of the
DLDCCC, resources that will be of particular use to our investigators. This core also accesses a cancer
genetics laboratory for specialized molecular studies including FISH and sequencing and bioinformatics
support to support tissue-banking software needs for the lymphoma SPORE. Bioinformatics support comes
from the DLDCCC Biomedical Informatics Group that supports OpenSpecimen, a secure web-based modular
application that serves as the unifying hub for all DLDCCC-based biorepositories, including the BCM Breast
and Lymphoma SPOREs. In the last funding period, the Resource Allocation Committee approved 25
requests from SPORE and external investigators for tissue or blood samples."
10926928,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
The Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) serves as the critical bidirectional interface between 
all components of the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) and a rich tapestry 
of community health system partners, sovereign Tribal Nations, Hispanic/Latinx populations, cancer community 
advocates, and patient support organizations. The COE facilitates efforts to overcome cancer health disparities 
in our catchment area, the State of New Mexico (NM), as the focal point for engagement and communication 
between the UNMCCC and our catchment area communities. Major characteristics of our catchment area 
include its diverse multiethnic, multicultural, and rural population composition, primarily Hispanic, American 
Indian, and non-Hispanic white; persistent socioeconomic challenges including deep poverty and food insecurity; 
and access to health care challenges. Today’s COE, formalized in 2018, coordinates with and builds upon 
existing UNMCCC cancer surveillance and community-engaged initiatives. Within this context, COE proposes 
the following specific aims: 1) define and characterize the catchment area, 2) prioritize cancer-related needs 
through engagement and communication with all stakeholders, 3) facilitate cancer research, and 4) disseminate, 
implement, and evaluate multi-level cancer control strategies to reduce cancer burden within and beyond the 
catchment area. To accomplish these aims, the COE has convened two major partnering groups: the Community 
Advisory Board (CAB) and Tribal Advisory Council. Systematic engagement with these groups, other key 
stakeholder organizations, and UNMCCC leadership led to identification of the following priority areas: 1) the 
fundamental burden of cancer health disparities, 2) enhancing access to cancer care, including receipt of timely 
screening and treatment, 3) reducing financial hardship associated with the continuum of cancer care, 4) 
survivorship needs, and 5) examining links between environmental exposures and cancer risk/incidence. The 
COE is led by Andrew Sussman, PhD, MCRP (CCPS), with COE representation on the UNMCCC Protocol 
Monitoring Review Committee (Miria Kano, PhD (CCPS)), a Senior Program Manager, and four community 
outreach specialists possessing unique cultural and linguistic concordance to engage American Indian, Hispanic,
and underserved communities. COE major roles and impact include integration of innovative cancer surveillance 
registries and data sources to facilitate catchment area monitoring and priority area assessment; catalyzing 
impactful, culturally appropriate, and rigorous cancer control and care delivery research in all priority areas both 
within and beyond the catchment area; dissemination of comprehensive statewide cancer control education, 
training strategies, and policy impacting recommendations; and engagement with UNMCCC clinical trial 
components leading to high proportions of underrepresented minority accruals in research aligned with
catchment area priorities."
10926929,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Lymphoma SPORE Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to support innovative
translational research projects that may in the future develop into full projects. To achieve this objective, the
DRP will solicit submission of novel projects with translational potential in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). The program will be led by directors Drs. Malcolm Brenner and Margaret Goodell, who
continue as DRP leaders, and new co-leader Dr George Carrum who brings with him clinical expertise and a
commitment to increasing diversity among DRP awardees. Candidate projects will be reviewed by a panel
with expertise in translational research and the most promising proposals will be selected for support. Our
goal for each supported project is that it will either develop into a full SPORE project or secure peer-reviewed
funding as an independent project. We will continue to achieve this goal by fully incorporating the leaders of
developmental projects into the SPORE, enabling them to take advantage of the expertise of SPORE
investigators in translating their project from the bench to bedside.
 In the last four years, our Lymphoma SPORE DRP has supported a broad portfolio of 9 projects by
diverse investigators from five different Departments and Centers within Baylor College of Medicine as well
as other institutions in the Texas Medical Center (one award to Texas A&M and one to Rice University) and
nationally (one award to Moffitt Cancer Center). Five female and two underrepresented minority investigators
have led the nine DRP projects supported in most recent funding period and have already been leveraged to
obtain $8.65 million in peer-reviewed funding from an initial investment of $450,000. Long-term follow up of
the 28 projects funded in the first two cycles of our SPORE shows 46 publications that have been cited over
4,300 times and over $18.4 million dollars in peer-reviewed funding from an investment of $1.4 million through
our DRP. In collaboration with the Administrative Core, the DRP directors will continue to use this program to
test and develop novel strategies for the treatment of lymphoma and CLL, and will also collect data to evaluate
the success of the DRP program, including seeking the feedback and advice of our internal and external
advisory boards."
10926932,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Lymphoma SPORE’s Career Enhancement Program is to provide support for young
investigators pursuing careers in translational lymphoma research as well as for established investigators
who wish to refocus their work on lymphoma. The program is led by Drs. Helen Heslop, Martha Mims and Sid
Ganguly and will be co-ordinated by the Administrative Core with oversight from the Executive Committee
and Internal and External Advisory Boards. Continually improved throughout the previous funding cycles, our
established Career Enhancement Program has well-defined processes and for candidate recruitment. We will
continue to collaborate with the Baylor Office of Diveristy, Equity, and Inclusion to devote significant effort to
recruit women and minorities to our program and the field of lymphoma research — an initiative that has been
successful in the past funding periods when 53% of trainees were female and 37% were under-represented
minorities (Hispanic or African American). Both MD and PhD trainees will be able to take advantage of courses
available through the Clinical Scientist Training Program at Baylor College of Medicine and will have a strong
group of mentors with broad translational expertise. We have developed mentoring strategies focued on the
unique challenges of moving cell and gene therapies from the bench-to-the-bedside, as well as the dynamics
of team science, that enhance the overall training program. Specifically, these strategies include providing
trainees with multiple mentors that possess complementary skills, individualized training plans, and multiple
opportunities to participate in learning courses and attend lectures relevant to the field. Additionally, trainees
have access to the SPORE cores (Clinical Research and Biostatistics, Cell Processing and Vector Production,
Biospecimen and Pathology) with unique expertise in cell and gene therapy and clinical research. In the last
14 years,19 awardees have been selected for this Program, seven of whom are now incorporated into the
SPORE program with 4 as project leaders in the current renewal . This Program will therefore ensure that the
SPORE will continue to train promising investigators who will contribute to translational lymphoma research
into the future."

 Mammalian dosage compensation equalizes X-linked gene expression between XX females and XY
males. Defective dosage compensation can cause cell and organismal lethality. Current models posit that
mammalian dosage compensation requires X-inactivation and that X-inactivation requires the X-linked Xist
long noncoding RNA. Despite much work, however, whether Xist and X-inactivation are essential for dosage
compensation remains unclear. The goal of this proposal is to define how mammalian dosage compensation
originated and evolved. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (i) determine the temporal and tissue-
specific requirement of Xist RNA and X-inactivation in dosage compensation; and, to (ii) test the contributions
of ancestral and evolutionarily conserved X chromosome-encoded factors in dosage compensation in the
mouse model system. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that mammalian dosage compensation
originated independently of Xist and X-inactivation and that ancestral X chromosome-encoded factors
equalized X-linked gene expression between the sexes. The rationale for this proposal is that it provides
insights into how cells manage differences in their sex chromosome complements specifically and how cells
equalize gene expression despite differences in chromosome copy number more generally. The proposal's
central hypothesis will be tested through the following approaches: 1) determine the requirements of Xist RNA
and X-inactivation in dosage compensation in the epiblast lineage, which generates all somatic tissues; and, 2)
test the contributions of two ancestral X chromosome-encoded genes in dosage compensation in the absence
Xist and X-inactivation. Dosage compensation will first be analyzed in homozygous Xist-null (XistD/D) female
mouse embryos, embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and neural progenitor cells
(NPCs), and tissues of XistD/D female mice, which we have found to be viable and fertile. Next, X chromosome
dosage compensation will be tested in embryos, EpiLCs, NPCs, and tissues of adult mice that lack Xist and
also one or both alleles of the candidate ancestral dosage compensation factors. The proposed research is
innovative and potentially transformative because it defines novel and Xist- and X inactivation-independent
mechanisms of mammalian dosage compensation using advanced transcriptomic and chromatin profiling
techniques. In the absence of Xist and X-inactivation, the proposal's central hypothesis predicts that the
ancestral candidate genes execute dosage compensation either through random monoallelism or by
simultaneously diminishing expression from both alleles of X-linked genes in XX female cells. The significance
of the proposal is that it will define when, where, and which genes Xist RNA silences during development and
delineate the functions of ancestral X-linked genes in novel Xist- and X inactivation-independent modes of
dosage compensation. Overall, the proposal promises to mechanistically define how mammalian X
chromosome dosage compensation originated and has evolved.

10919329,"Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third among newly diagnosed cancers in the United States, and it is the
second most common cause of cancer mortality. Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at
several fold high-risk of developing CRC. Guanylyl cyclase-C (GC-C) is activated upon binding of guanylin
(GN) or uroguanylin (UG), resulting in stimulation in cyclic GMP (cGMP) production leading to fluid secretion
in proximal intestine to normalize bowel movement. Two orally administered GC-C agonists TRULANCE®
and LINZESS® are approved for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel
syndrome-constipation (IBS-c). Beyond fluid secretion in proximal intestine, activation of GC-C signaling by
UG or GN also regulates colonic epithelial homeostasis and tumor susceptibility. Pioneering results from PI’s
lab showed that transcript levels of both UG and GN are reduced dramatically in human colon polyps and
adenocarcinomas, and that the dietary supplementation with human UG not only inhibited polyp formation
but also delayed their progression to adenocarcinomas in Apc+/Min mice. Subsequently, several other
researchers have shown that disruption in GC-C signaling, due to near universal loss of GN and UG, disrupts
the intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis in early stages of CRC. Thus, oral treatment with GC-C agonist to
overcome this deficiency may represent a promising novel approach for treatment and/or prevention of all
types of CRC. In this context, orally administered plecanatide or dolcanatide (Dol), analogues of UG,
effectively ameliorated GI inflammation in acute and chronic models of experimental colitis in mice. In
addition, dietary supplementation with plecanatide suppressed generation of colonic tumors in mice.
However, it was observed that orally administered GC-C agonist showed inverted U (bell shaped) therapeutic
responses in these animal studies. These results raised the possibility that the higher doses might lead to
excessive fluid secretion in the proximal intestine, which might wash out the drug prior to reaching colon, and
thereby, resulting in the reduced therapeutic effect. In addition, GC-C signaling is also disrupted by
overexpression of cGMP-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) in GI inflammatory diseases and CRC. Thus,
combination of a GC-C agonist with a PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil; Sil) might produce additive or synergistic
effect. PI developed an oral formulation of drug-loaded microparticles that were sequentially coated with
time- and pH-dependent polymers to bypass stomach and proximal intestine regions, and to release drug in
distal intestine and colon. This SBIR phase 1 grant proposal is to evaluate microspheres-loaded formulation
of Dol either alone or in combination with Sil to prevent colitis associated CRC in mice. Specific aims are:
AIM 1, to develop and optimize drug-loaded microspheres formulations of placebo (inactive peptide SP-300),
Dol and Sil. In specific Aim 2, the optimized formulations of Dol and Sil, either alone or in combination, will
be evaluated to prevent AOM-DSS induced CRC in B6 mice. Colon tissue (proximal, middle and distal
segments) will be collected for evaluation for stimulation GC-C and PDE5 signaling. Successful completion
of the proposed studies is expected to identify a suitable microsphere-loaded formulation of Dol either alone
or in combination with Sil for further non-clinical and clinical development to prevent CRC in humans."

The mission of the NIH/NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) program is to accelerate basic and
applied infectious disease research by providing access to cutting edge bioinformatic tools, knowledgebases,
and expertise, ensuring that our knowledge of pathogenesis can be translated into diagnostics, therapeutics
and a public health response that mitigates the morbidity and mortality resulting from infectious diseases. The
current NIH/NIAID-funded Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC; Contract No.
75N93019C00076) supported this mission by providing a bioinformatics knowledgebase and analysis platform
covering all bacterial and viral pathogens. In response to the NIAID notice of funding opportunity, RFA-AI-23-
032, our proposal intends to maintain, improve, and expand the BV-BRC to combat future infectious disease
threats, while maintaining our commitment to enhance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, fostering a
more inclusive scientific community, and ensuring equitable access to bioinformatics resources.
BV-BRC will support bacteria, archaea, viruses, bacteriophages, as well as metagenomic analyses,
with particular emphasis on the microbiomes and viromes related to infectious disease and public
health. BV-BRC will continue to support the basic scientific research necessary to understand the biology of
these organisms, their pathogenesis, and disease processes; support development of diagnostics and
therapeutics to combat pathogenic organisms; and provide a rapid response framework to effectively deal with
the inevitable and unpredictable outbreaks and pandemics. To support these overarching goals, we propose to
extend and enhance BV-BRC through the following four key elements: 1) Maintain and enhance the BV-BRC
knowledgebase to support exponential growth of data and usage and provide integrated access to omics data,
metadata, analysis services and visualization tools, private user workspace, and user documentation to allow
users to analyze public and private data and share or publish results; 2) Develop innovative tools and
technologies to provide comprehensive services for viral and bacterial bioinformatics, metagenomics, drug
development, and developing AI-driven natural language-based user interface for interacting with data and
tools, with emphasis on improving user experience; 3) Offer critical bioinformatics expertise, outreach, and
training to the community, with emphasis on fostering opportunities for students and researchers from minority
and underserved communities by providing freely accessible training material and conducting training for
instructors from underrepresented institutions, with particular focus on Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs); and
4) Provide cutting-edge support to rapidly respond to emerging needs, outbreaks, and pandemic preparedness
by building on the tools and procedures developed during COVID-19 and Mpox pandemics and enhancing
them to improve readiness and response to future outbreaks and pandemics."

IPF is a terminal lung disease causing 40,000 deaths in the US each year, with a life expectancy of three to five
years, and characterized by the formation of sporadic patches of fibrotic tissue scarring resulting in inevitable
lung failure. Currently, there are only two palliative treatments available and lung transplant is a rare solution
only 0.02% of patients can access. There is a growing interest in cell replacement therapy (CeRT) to restore
organ function. Cellforma founders have demonstrated that CeRT is feasible and showed efficacy in an IPF
mouse model. However, a scalable and cost-effective way to acquire the cells needed for IPF CeRT in patients
is currently not yet achieved. Chemical reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) has recently been demonstrated but generating the IPF-relevant human lung cell types required has not
been achieved. Cellforma is developing a data-driven, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) platform to
identify scalable and cost-effective chemical strategies to reprogram easy-to-acquire cells, such as human
dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from the skin, into hard or impossible-to-acquire lung cells. The company's graph-
based AI/ML examines the complexity of cell behavior using chemical perturbation data to produce
“reprogramming maps” that allow the generation of the desired cell types, faster protocol discovery times
compared to current trial-and-error approaches, and without genetic engineering, viral vectors, or expensive
growth factors. Cellforma will develop a mixture of reprogrammed human lung epithelial progenitor and
supporting cells as a curative, first-in-class, CeRT for IPF patients. For this SBIR Phase I AIM 1 is to develop
gene regulatory and chemical graph-based AI/ML to identify HDF-to-lung chemical reprogramming strategies.
AIM 2 is to generate IPF-relevant lung cell types and experimentally assess their stability and functionality. HDFs
or iPSCs will be reprogrammed into the desired lung AT2, and stromal fibroblast (SF) cell types. Cellforma aims
to demonstrate that chemical reprogramming of HDFs to these relevant cells types can be performed at
efficiencies higher than current standards. At the end of Phase I, Cellforma is expected to have established
proprietary AI/ML to identify chemical protocols to transform HDFs into the lung AT2, and SFs required for CeRT
in IPF patients with experimental validation of successful chemical cell reprogramming."
10913911,"Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common cause of liver diseases such as acute and chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis,
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV infection continues to pose a major threat to global public
health, affecting more than 250 million people worldwide. Although licensed vaccines can effectively prevent new
HBV infection, they do not offer therapeutic benefits to the hundreds of million people already infected with HBV.
The biggest challenge to cure chronic hepatitis B is the lack of therapeutics to eliminate HBV covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA), which is responsible for HBV persistence. Current standard antiviral therapies consisting
of interferon and/or nucleoside analogs can suppress HBV replication but do not significantly affect the level of
HBV cccDNA. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover and develop new classes of antiviral drugs capable of
eliminating HBV infection. Over the years, the search for a cure of chronic hepatitis B has been hampered by the
lack of robust cell culture systems of HBV propagation and small animal models of HBV infection and replication.
The discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor has made it
possible to develop cell culture models of HBV infection. However, NTCP per se does not confer HBV
susceptibility in transgenic mice, suggesting other co-receptors that may be needed for more efficient HBV
infection in vivo. Through preliminary studies, we have found that human apolipoprotein E (apoE) and
apoE-binding receptors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor
(LDLR) family proteins promote HBV infection. More significantly, our preliminary data suggest that
co-expression of NTCP with human apoE and LDLR in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9)-deficient mice could confer HBV susceptibility. Strikingly, inoculation of NTCP/apoE3/LDLR/PCSK9-/-
mice with HBV derived from HBV-transgenic mice expressing human apoE3 resulted in a high HBV viremia
(~106 genome copy equivalents/mL) in the mouse sera after one week of HBV inoculation. We hypothesize that
the cell tropism of HBV is not only determined by its receptor NTCP but also by host factors promoting HBV
infection, transcription, and replication. The overall goal of this application is to develop robust mouse models of
HBV infection and replication for investigation of HBV infection, transcription, replication, pathogenesis, and host
immune response to HBV infection as well as for evaluation of HBV-specific antiviral drugs and therapeutic
strategies in vivo. Our specific aims are: 1) to develop an immunocompetent mouse model of HBV infection and
replication; 2) to construct novel mouse models of HBV persistence; and 3) to develop an immunodeficient
mouse model of HBV infection and to determine host immune control of HBV infection. The successful
completion of this application will have a profound impact on HBV research by providing novel mouse models of
HBV infection and replication and new therapeutic strategies towards the ultimate cure of chronic hepatitis B."

The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), Children’s of Mississippi, and the UMMC Department of
Pediatrics are seeking to continue to be a site for the ECHO Institutional Development Award (IDeA) States
Pediatric Clinical Trials Network-2 (ISPCTN-2). Our site, the Mississippi ECHO ISPCTN-2 (MS-CTN2) has
made considerable progress with implementation of the initial ISPCTN fuding in 2016, greatly expanding our
institutional infrastructure and opening 2 pediatric trials: Vitamin D Supplementation in Children with Obesity-
Related Asthma and the Pharmacokinetics of Understudied Drugs Administered to Children Per Standard of
Care study.
The UMMC site’s overarching objectives are:
1. Build upon previous Network success and further enhance of our UMMC pediatric clinical research team to
 reliably conduct Network pediatric clinical trials;
2. Promote engagement in pediatric clinical trials across largely rural and underserved communities;
3. Make substantive contributions to the NIH’s ECHO program that inform the health of future generations of
 children; and
4. Broaden faculty, staff, and institutional capacity-building infrastructure for engagement in Network trials.
Our ISPCTN site has increased readiness for pediatric trials through increasing pediatric infrastructure
supports during the initial funding cycle. The capacity of our site has grown considerably through ISPCTN
provided trainings, collaborations with other sites, and institutional collaboration with the Mississippi Center for
Clinical and Translational Research (MCCTR). Our team has gained experience in trial recruitment and will
continue to build capacity for recruitment in rural communities during ISPCTN-2. Site investigators at UMMC
have made important contributions to the ISPCTN program, leading working groups and developing a pediatric
trial. Scholarly work products have grown through collaborations established within the ISPCTN.
With MS-CTN2, our site will continue to be fully engaged with ECHO ISPCTN trials, including those that seek
to improve care for infants exposed to opioids in utero. With ISPCTN-2 we expect to develop, implement and
complete 3 clinical trials that address ECHO disease priorities. In addition, our junior faculty will develop a
research protocol that informs an IPSCTN-2 multi-center trial. Finally, our site is leading a proposal to test an
already empirically validated psychosocial intervention, extending this intervention to high risk infants and
across rural communities, representing a novel extension to an existing intervention.
Our MS-CTN2 site is poised to become a major pediatric research center in the rural and medically
underserved communities of the deep South. With continued support our site will contribute new data from
trials that extend into rural communities, thus increasing the generalizability from pediatric trials research."
10916314,"Murine and Clinical Tumors (MCT) Core services. Project Summary
The simultaneous combination of anti-PD-L1 with BRAFV600MUT and MEK inhibitors (so-called “triplet” therapy),
in early clinical data, appears beneficial and has recently been approved for patients with BRAFV600MUT melanoma
(13). This is first mutation-immune co-targeted therapy to be approved, but the data on this triplet appear mixed,
with other trials not meeting key endpoints (14), suggesting that simultaneous combination is not optimal.
Importantly, retrospective clinical data analysis and in vivo therapeutic modeling using syngeneic models of
murine melanoma showed that a regimen of anti-PD-1/L1 (± anti-CTLA-4) lead-in before MAPKi combination
augments the efficacy of triplet therapy by enhancing MAPKi durability (and overcoming innate resistance to
immune checkpoint blockade) (12). Thus, the realization that immune factors drive resistance to MAPKi therapy
opens the door to immune-based strategies, such as adoptive cell therapy (ACT) (Project 1, Aim 3), as
combinatorial agents to prevent MAPKi resistance.
Building on this recent progress, this Murine and Clinical Tumors (MCT) Core will offer Projects 1 and 2 model
and clinical tumors to obtain multi-scale (spatiotemporal) profiles of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME)
early and late on single-agent (MAPKi or anti-PD-1/L1) therapy (Project 1, Aim 1). These “early” data will provide
inputs to the agent-based models (ABMs) being developed in Project 1, Aim 2, and “late” data will help validate
predictions. Profiles from more successful combination strategies will be compared against less successful
combination strategies to teach the ABM on optimized TMEs. This core will also offer clinical tissues for
translational validation (Project 1, Aim 4) and tumor models to test predicted novel combination therapies
(Project 2, Aim 3)."

Young adults (18-30 years) in the US are suffering from unprecedented increases in depressive
symptomatology, anxiety, and loneliness, which are major risk factors for mental illness. Building from our
controlled clinical trials of digital mindfulness meditation training, our company has released an interactive and
data-driven mindfulness meditation application called Equa, which can help reduce the mental distress and
loneliness facing young adults today. There are now 1000s of mindfulness meditation digital apps on the
commercial market, but these apps suffer from poor user engagement over time, and our clinical trials show
that sustained engagement is critical for mental health outcomes. Our overarching goal is to translate our
clinical trials results and evidence-based Equa training platform into a commercial product that helps young
adult users stay engaged with mindfulness training in order to reduce mental distress and loneliness. This
proposal describes new research and development of a respiration biosignal feedback technology, which will
help Equa users better visualize and understand their mindfulness skill development. Building on our
preliminary studies, this fast track SBIR proposal will first validate a new respiration biosignal feedback tool on
Equa in distressed young adults (in Phase I), and then to test whether this new Equa biosignal feedback
improves user engagement and outcomes among distressed young adults (in Phase II). Specifically in Phase I,
we will collect Equa-guided meditation data with respiration tracking in distressed young adults (Study 1 N=80)
in order to optimize deep learning algorithms that link changes in respiration dynamics with pre-post session
changes in mindfulness skills (Phase I performance milestone: 90% prediction accuracy). We will also conduct
usability testing (Study 2 N=60) with the respiration biosignal feedback features on Equa (Phase I milestones:
>85 on System Usability Scale (SUS), and experimentally evaluate if Equa-augmented respiration biosignal
tracking significantly increases user satisfaction relative to Equa with no biosignal tracking). In Phase II, we will
conduct a three arm clinical trial comparing Equa guided meditation training with respiration biosignal feedback
to Equa without respiration biosignal feedback or an active stress management control program in distressed
young adults (N=300). It is predicted that respiration biosignal feedback (relative to the two active comparator
groups) significantly increases user satisfaction and platform engagement, and significantly reduces mental
distress and loneliness at post treatment and one month follow-up. In doing so, this research will position Equa
for dissemination to a large young adult market. The ultimate goal of this fast track proposal is to develop a
more engaging and evidence-based mindfulness meditation product for curbing the growing mental health
crisis in young adults."

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a progressive condition that currently affects over 6 million patients in the US.
It accounts for over $35B in annual healthcare expenditure and is responsible for over one million hospitalizations
each year. Approximately half of all patients with CHF have a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) greater than
40% and are categorized as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF ≥ 50%) or mid-
range ejection fraction (HFmrEF, 40% ≤ EF < 50%). The prognosis for these patients is poor: due to a paucity
of treatment options, patients have 5-year and 10-year mortality rates of 50% and 90%, respectively. Although
existing pharmacological therapies have demonstrated symptomatic improvement and mortality benefit in
patients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure, there are currently limited FDA-approved treatment options
(pharmacological or device-based) for the HFpEF/HFmrEF patient population. The concept of interatrial shunting
has gained attention as a potential therapeutic option for patients with CHF. By creating a connection between
the high-pressure left atrium to the low-pressure right atrium elevated left atrial pressure (LAP) may be effectively
lowered thereby relieving CHF symptoms. Thus far, interatrial shunt implants have demonstrated positive safety
signals and positive reported outcomes, including significant reduction in left atrial filling pressure, improvements
in 6-minute walk test, quality of life, and New York Heart Association classification and most importantly, heart
failure events. Nonetheless intracardiac implants carry proven clinical risks including clot formation, device
fracture and migration, implantation failure, and interference with future cardiac interventional therapies. There
is currently no device available that can provide therapeutic left atrial decompression without the long-term
clinical risks and concerns of leaving behind a foreign body in the heart. Alleviant Medical has developed a novel
transcatheter approach to relieve left atrial pressure by creating an interatrial shunt without the need for a cardiac
implant. Following the success of design verification testing and positive results from a 38-patient first-in-human
clinical study, Alleviant received FDA IDE approval to investigate the safety and efficacy of a no-implant interatrial
shunt for patients with heart failure in a pivotal randomized controlled trial which is currently underway. The goal
of this Commercial Readiness Pilot proposal has two aims: (1) implement high-volume manufacturing capabilities
and establish production readiness of the ALV1 System, and (2) execute reimbursement and marketing initiatives
to establish value to payers and promote disease and therapy awareness. To achieve this goal, Alleviant will
procure and complete injection mold qualifications for scaled production of critical components, implement
design for manufacturing process modifications, de-risk single source supply chain elements, and increase the
sterilization throughput capacity. Alleviant will develop and execute a strategy for achieving reimbursement
through the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Systems for a no-implant interatrial shunt therapy. Successful
execution of this proposal will result in a commercial ready System with an established pathway reimbursement."

Within healthy adult tissues, a developing organism, and disease environments alike, cells exist in environments
where they receive and integrate external signals according to a phenotypic state, yielding responses in
cellular activities and behaviors or modifications to phenotypic state. Fundamental understanding of cellular
functioning and disease progression depends in part on our ability to systematically build and perturb model
cellular systems in vitro, and pressing biomedical challenges in translational medicine might be addressed
through the technology that enables breakthroughs in tissue engineering, including in meeting the critical
needs of patients awaiting organ transplants. Over the past decades, a range of biofabrication technologies
have been used to precisely arrange cells and materials within two- and three-dimensional structures. These
technologies have broadened our understanding biology and increased the complexity of tissue constructs that
might be used therapeutically. While biofabrication approaches developed over this time have greatly
benefitted our abilities to probe and understand biological questions—especially with respect to cells and their
environments—and to engineer cell-material constructs that recapitulate features of native tissues, significant
challenges persist in building multiscale biomimetic tissue constructs. Our lab’s research is focused on
addressing these challenges through the development and application of new biofabrication technologies that
are based on innovation in the design and use of hydrogel biomaterials. Within the next five years, the lab aims
to develop and apply unique hydrogel-based technology to bioprinting to address the critical need for
capabilities to create vascularized tissue constructs in which cell and material complexity can be specified in
extravascular regions and that can support dense cell populations. The lab will also develop new biofabrication
technologies that will allow unique capabilities for high resolution control over cellular and material structures
within macroscale constructs, with the goal of being able to simultaneously control a broad range of
microenvironmental features—including cell-cell interactions, biochemical cues, and biomechanical cues—that
a given cell experiences. We aim to develop technological capabilities and ultimately apply these capabilities to
building complex tissue constructs that might be used as platforms for studying tissue and vascular responses
to perturbations by physical and biological stimuli and to address key challenges in tissue engineering to
develop therapeutic tissue constructs. The work in this proposal thus aims to advance capabilities in the fields
of biofabrication and tissue engineering, with broad potential impacts in applied and translational research."

Globally, there were an estimated 36.9 million people living with HIV in 2017. As a result of the increased
availability of antiretroviral therapy, life expectancy for these patients has increased, resulting in an expansion
and aging of the HIV-infected population. Data from both high- and low-resource countries have shown an
escalating burden of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders among HIV patients. Care for this now aging
cohort requires modifying service delivery models towards the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and control of
chronic HLBS disorders. The successful implementation of various solutions developed in response to the global
HIV/AIDS pandemic can serve as the foundation to transform global healthcare delivery systems towards HLBS
disorder care. The overarching goals of this Research Coordinating Center are: (1) provide scientific,
organizational, statistical, quality control, capacity building and operational leadership for the Implementation
Science projects to be funded by the companion RFA-HL-20-025 and (2) promote and teach Implementation
Research strategies to advance collaborative dialogue across projects and ensure up-to-date conceptualization,
specification and measurement of implementation strategies and outcomes. In support of these goals, we have
assembled a highly experienced and multidisciplinary research team. Our team, with expertise in running
multicenter trials, dissemination and implementation research, biostatistics and research design, HIV, HLBS
disorders, capacity building, and data management, will pursue the following specific aims:
1. To oversee management, organizational, and communication activities across all research sites including
 working with NHLBI to prepare meeting agendas, develop the study website, provide administrative support
 for research projects, and organize face-to-face meetings.
2. To collaborate with all research sites in developing the scientific and operational details of their
 implementation science research protocols. These efforts will include:
 a. Assisting study sites in designing, testing, and maintaining password protected data entry and
 management systems and ensuring that such systems implement robust quality control features.
 b. Harmonizing (a) demographic, clinical, and questionnaire measurements across research sites and (b)
 the conceptualization and measurement of implementation strategies and implementation outcomes.
 c. In collaboration with research sites, to statistically analyze harmonized data and to assist in the analysis
 of site-specific data as reports, manuscripts, and abstracts are prepared.
3. To measure critical contextual Implementation Science factors in each research setting in order to enable
 conceptualization of the mechanism of effect and, by extension, enable formalized assessments of external
validity.
To oversee the development and implementation of training and capacity building activities."
10928098,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1)
The lack of translation between mouse and human pain treatments has highlighted limitations of both the animal
models of pain and molecular tools used to characterize them. This has prompted major efforts to characterize
molecular features that are expressed in human nociceptors which may provide new ideas for pain therapeutic
design. Recent advances in single-cell genomics now make it possible to characterize gene expression profiles,
location in space, and the physiology of individual cells within complex tissues at unprecedented resolution. We
have thus developed protocols for characterizing these multi-dimensional features of human nociceptors at
single-cell resolution and propose to build upon these protocols here and in coordination with other U19
PRECISION Human Pain Centers.
Molecular
We then propose to leverage our single-cell genomic and epigenomic protocols to build a human nociceptor cell
atlas derived from a diverse group of donor samples. These data will help characterize the diversity of human
nociceptor subtypes, the epigenomic elements that establish these subtypes, and the effect of common genetic
variation on gene expression within these clinically important cell types. Together, these datasets will provide a
rich resource for mining novel pain therapeutic targets and for interpreting how common genetic variation affects
gene expression in human nociceptors. This latter point is especially important for interpreting case-control
studies across the pain research community.
Structural
We will generate and analyze large-scale single-cell spatial transcriptomic data of human ganglia to study the
location of nociceptor subtypes in sensory ganglia and whether there are unique gene expression profiles in the
non-neuronal cells (e.g. satellite glia) that are closely associated nociceptors as compared to other neuronal
subtypes.
Physiological
We will culture fresh sensory neurons from each donor and measure their spontaneous and capsaicin-evoked
activity. We will then use single-cell spatial transcriptomics to correlate gene expression profiles in each neuron
with their associated spontaneous and capsaicin-evoked activity. These data will generate a resource that
integrates both molecular and functional dimensions nociceptors."
10928100,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Human Tissue Procurement and Processing Core)
Despite advances in our understanding of nociception in animal models, pain targets in mice have experienced
decades of difficulty in translation to novel effective and safe treatments for patients with chronic pain. The lack
of translation between mouse and human pain treatments has highlighted limitations of animal models of pain.
Recent advances in applying single-cell genomics and physiology directly to human tissue positions our field to
make important new advances in pain biology with improved opportunities for clinical translation. The Human
Tissue Procurement and Processing Core will be responsible for obtaining high-quality tissue from post-mortem
donors and chronic pain patients with informed consent.
The experience of most forms of neuropathic pain begins with abnormal firing of peripheral nociceptors, whose
cell bodies are in the dorsal root ganglia or trigeminal ganglia. These ganglia reside outside of the central nervous
system and would make ideal pain therapeutic targets if they could be inhibited selectively. We thus propose to
extract dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia and distal sciatic nerve from post-mortem human donors using an
established rapid autopsy program at Massachusetts General Hospital. This IRB-approved protocol is already
underway and has collected samples from > 25 donors, a selection of which were successfully processed for
single-nucleus genomic assays. The Core will build upon these established tissue procurement and processing
protocols in collaboration with other U19 Centers.
To characterize molecular changes that occur in patients with chronic pain, patients with chronic phantom limb
secondary to symptomatic neuromas will have their neuromas procured during muscle reinnervation surgery.
This protocol is IRB approved and already enrolling. Fresh and frozen samples will be made available to Center
investigators for single-cell genomic assays.
The Core will also maintain a tissue bank of deidentified frozen tissues for distribution to Center investigators
and investigators across the PRECISION Human Pain Network."
10916795,"This proposal seeks to continue the SPURRS (San Antonio Program for Undergraduate Research in Renal
Science) at the University of Texas Health San Antonio Long School of Medicine to attract promising
undergraduate students and recent graduates from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in kidney research.
Kidney disease affects approximately 15-20% of the US population and accounts for ~16% of Medicare
expenditures each year. New therapies to stem the suffering and expense associated with kidney disease have
been slow to develop and will require a robust, diverse research workforce. At the same time, interest in
nephrology careers has plummeted, with the number of applicants for nephrology training programs remains
substantially below the number of training positions available. Efforts are desperately needed to cultivate the
next generation of kidney researchers and reverse this trend. Established in 2019, the Aim of the SPURRS
Program is to address this need by providing outstanding and motivated undergraduate students with an
immersive 10 week mentored summer research experience supplemented by a kidney research and career
development curriculum. At the end of their research experience, students will present the results of their
projects to their peers from the other R25 centers and NIDDK officials at the annual KUH Summer Student
Research Symposium. Together, these activities will expose students to the exciting world of kidney research
and provide them with a knowledge base, critical thinking skills, personal development tools and an enthusiasm
for discovery. These attributes are critical for their development into biomedical researchers and contributing to
the future of nephrology, which is the long-term goal of SPURRS. Results from the current funding cycle show
that we are able to recruit an outstanding and diverse group of students who subsequently have a high rate
(80%) of progression towards careers in medicine and biomedical research. The Aims of the proposal are to: 1.
Recruit a cohort of highly qualified and enthusiastic students, 2. Provide a hands-on research experience
through which students will learn how discovery, clinical and translational kidney research are conducted and
the results are disseminated to others, and 3. Provide mentoring and career development activities to enhance
entry and retention of the students into careers as kidney research scientists. We are uniquely positioned to
achieve the goals of our Program. UT Health San Antonio has a robust portfolio of kidney research programs
through which students will gain exposure to cutting edge research, a cadre of experienced mentors to guide
and energize students about careers in biomedical investigation, a location in a large, growing city with a large
population of URM students, and a PI with experience in leading R25 undergraduate research education
programs."
10925541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this R34 application (PAR-23-060, Formative and Pilot Intervention Research to Optimize HIV Prevention
and Care Continuum Outcomes), we propose to develop and pilot test an integrated intervention that
addresses the dual and interconnected priorities of mental health and HIV medication adherence. This
research responds to the global public health calls to enhance HIV intervention science for MSM who
experience growing HIV prevalence and the highest HIV incidence rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite South
Africa national campaigns to provide HIV prevention medication (daily PrEP) and treatment medication (ART)
to this population, growing evidence points to suboptimal adherence to these efficacious biomedical
interventions among MSM communities, and underscores a need for medication adherence programs targeting
this group. Common mental health problems such as depression are also prevalent among MSM, and
untreated mental health problems are strongly associated with poor adherence to PrEP and ART. There are
emerging indications that interventions providing targeted and integrated mental health treatment and
adherence support can impact both outcomes in general populations in sub-Saharan Africa, but there is need
to develop and evaluate MSM-focused programs. The proposed intervention, currently titled WeCare, will be
based on principles of problem-solving therapy, minority stress theory, and a status-neutral approach which
includes MSM in mental health and adherence interventions regardless of HIV status in order to optimize reach
and impact, minimize stigma, and enhance support in this community. We will use a three-phase research
approach to address our specific aims. First, we will conduct formative qualitative research to develop an
intervention approach targeting mental health and HIV medication adherence support, and that is responsive to
the social context and minority stressors in this key population. Second, we will conduct an open pilot to refine
and finalize the intervention manual and research protocol. Third, we will conduct a randomized pilot trial to
test the intervention compared to an enhanced standard of care control. Participants in the pilot trial will be
assessed at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months post-enrollment. We will assess intervention effects on primary
outcomes including a mental health, biologically confirmed medication adherence; exploratory secondary
outcomes including self-report medication adherence, PrEP persistence, and interest in long-acting PrEP and
ART; exploratory theoretical mediators including multidimensional stigma (internalized, anticipated, enacted,
concealment), social support, and positive identity. We will also conduct qualitive assessment to examine
intervention characteristics that can optimize further implementation and scalability. The findings from this
study will provide the necessary groundwork to examine the efficacy of this combined mental health and
medication adherence intervention in a future, large-scale clinical trial."

With the highest HIV incidence rates observed in the US, Florida strives to develop effective and sustainable
HIV prevention strategies. HIV screening and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are proven interventions to
prevent transmission and reduce new HIV infections. However, uptake of these HIV prevention services is low
among women relative to their needs and male counterparts. One of the key barriers to promoting HIV testing
and PrEP among women is the challenge of identifying women at risk of HIV acquisition by healthcare
providers. Researchers demonstrated potential HIV risk prediction models using electronic health records
(EHRs) among men. Unfortunately, they failed to identify HIV risk among women due to having fewer women
HIV incident cases in their datasets and a lack of risk factors tailored for women. To fill the gap, we propose to
develop an HIV risk prediction model specifically tailored for women and integrate the prediction model into
an EHR system as a clinical decision support prototype to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and usability with
primary care providers. In Aim 1, we will develop an HIV risk prediction model specific for women to identify
potential candidates for HIV testing and PrEP. Leveraging patients’ structured EHRs, ZIP code-linked
community-level factors and social determinants of health, and factors extracted from clinical notes via a state-
of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, we will use AI/machine learning to develop and
validate an HIV risk prediction model specifically developed for women (ACTION-HIV algorithm). The results
will be used to design a clinical decision support (CDS) prototype to help providers better identify women in
need of HIV testing and PrEP. In Aim 2, using a user-centered design approach guided by the five “rights” of
the CDS intervention framework, we will conduct 6 focus groups with providers to design and prototype a
women-specific HIV risk prediction CDS tool (ACTION-HIV CDS). In Aim 3, using think-aloud protocols and
surveys, we will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the ACTION-HIV algorithm and CDS in a
simulated EHR environment with 20 primary care providers at the UF Health outpatient clinics. We will
integrate our ACTION-HIV algorithm into UF Health’s EHR system (Epic) to produce the CDS alerts for HIV
testing and pilot test ACTION-HIV CDS in a simulated Epic environment presenting synthetic patient data.
Our proposed research is highly innovative as it expands past HIV risk prediction models and pioneers in
designing and prototyping HIV testing and PrEP-related CDS in primary care settings. This project will provide
valuable insights into a future clinical trial which we will investigate the efficacy (including patient outcomes
such as rates of HIV testing and rates of PrEP prescription) of a women-specific HIV risk prediction CDS tool
within the real-time EHR production in real-world settings."
10924503,"PROJECT SUMARY/ABSTRACT
Eradicating HIV from infected individuals is obstructed by the formation of a reservoir of persistent infected cells;
eliminating this reservoir could allow a cure for HIV infection. Recent research provides clues to approaches for
reservoir eradication. Rare, infected individuals, termed elite controllers (EC), control HIV without treatment with
antiretroviral medications. Analysis of HIV reservoirs in these individuals supports a model in which most
efficiently expressed HIV proviruses have been eliminated. Thus, integration sites of proviruses from ECs are
found enriched in genomic regions associated with heterochromatin and transcriptional repression. This overall
pattern is, however, violated by some clonally expanded infected cells with genic integrations that show ongoing
viral transcription. It has been suggested that these clones may have pro-survival and/or immune resistance
characteristics, but this remains poorly understood. Our team has shown that the above features can be
recapitulated by the application of CD8+ T-cell pressure in a novel mouse model of long-term infection, termed
the Participant Derived Xenograft (PDX) model. For this, T-cells are obtained from ECs and separated into
fractions. Naïve T cells are removed, which eliminates graft-versus-host disease upon transplantation into mice.
CD4+ memory T cells are transplanted into immunodeficient mice, then HIV is introduced. Autologous CD8+ T-
cells are introduced or not in controls, allowing experimental assessment of CD8+ T-cell pressure. In preliminary
data, in the presence of CD8+ T-cells, the selected proviral population is smaller and viral loads lower. Advanced
sequencing of integration site distributions shows larger clone sizes in the presence of CD8+ T-cell pressure,
and multiple features paralleling results in ECs, such as favored integration outside transcription units, integration
in reverse orientation relative to host transcription, and favored integration in more heterochromatic nuclear
compartments to name a few. Thus, we propose to use the PDX model, advanced integration site analysis, and
further tools to address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To define in high resolution the integration site
features that enable the persistence of HIV proviruses under extended in vivo selection by CD8+ T-cells and
compare the effects of diverse approach to enhancing this pressure. We will test multiple interventions in the
PDX model to increase CD8+ T-cell pressure, reverse latency or block its establishment, and characterize in
detail the molecular correlates. Aim 2. To train and validate multivariate statistical models to quantify the degree
of CD8+ T-cell selection on a given pro-viral landscape and use the models to infer selection in interventional
clinical trials. Completion of this study will thus provide advanced tools for quantifying CD8+ T-cell pressure on
populations of integrated HIV proviruses, rich information on the functions of latency and immune modulators in
the PDX model and in human trials, and an evaluation of the novel hypothesis that HIV insertional mutagenesis
can confer resistance to CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing."
10926820,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current immunotherapy strategies, including immune checkpoint blockade therapy targeting CTLA-4 and/or
PD1/PD-L1, have yielded promising results in certain types of cancer patients. However, the overall success
rates of these strategies still vary from 15% to 35%, which suggests that there are other mechanisms and/or
checkpoint signaling involved that are unresponsive to therapy mediated by malignant tumors. Thus,
alternative novel strategies targeting more specific checkpoint molecules or interrupting tolerogenic pathways
are urgently needed. It is now well recognized that the suppression and dysfunction of tumor-reactive T cells
induced by regulatory T cells (Treg) in the tumor suppressive microenvironment present a major barrier for
successful anti-tumor immunotherapy. We recently discovered a novel suppressive mechanism whereby
human Treg cells induce senescence in effector T cells that then exhibit potent suppressive activity and
amplify immune suppression. Therefore, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that
control Treg-induced senescence in effector T cells is essential for the development of effective strategies to
treat human cancer. We identified significantly increased activation of the energy sensor AMPK and dys-
regulation of lipid metabolism in Treg-induced senescent T cells. Furthermore, ATM-associated DNA damage
response and MAPK signaling were selectively involved in T cell senescence mediated by human Treg cells.
In addition, we have discovered that human Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) signaling reverses the suppressive
function and prevents the induction of T cell senescence mediated by both naturally occurring Treg and tumor-
derived Treg cells. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that: 1) Human Treg cells can selectively
modulate molecular programs that rewrite T cell lipid metabolism in treated naïve/effector T cells, resulting in
their differentiation into senescent T cells; 2) Senescent and dysfunctional tumor-specific T cells can be
rejuvenated via checkpoint blockages of ATM and MAPK signaling in responder T cells, combined with TLR8
signaling activation in Treg cells, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. Specific Aim 1 seeks to
identify the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the induction of senescence and dysfunction in responder
T cells after interaction with Treg cells. We will dissect how Treg cells molecularly rewrite effector T cell fate
and lipid metabolism. Aim 2 will test the novel concept and strategy that TLR8-mediated reprogramming of
glucose metabolism in Treg cells combined with checkpoint blockage of selective MAPK and/or ATM-
associated DNA damage signaling in responder T cells can synergistically enhance anti-tumor immunity
through reversing the senescence and dysfunction of tumor-specific T cells. A positive outcome of these
studies should lead to novel strategies to reprogram Treg metabolism and control the fate and function of
tumor-specific T cells for the treatment of human cancers."

 Engineered T cells that express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific to tumor antigens have
shown exceptional efficacy in hematologic malignancies. However, their success in treating solid tumors
remains limited. Our understanding of the primary barriers faced by CAR T cells in solid tumors is hindered by
a lack of tissue specimens and suitable high-depth tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling technologies.
Model systems have largely been unsuccessful in accurately predicting human CAR T cell biology. To
understand the barriers faced by CAR T cells in solid tumors, Andrew J. Rech proposes an integrated spatial
multi-omic analytical platform. Dr. Rech plans to apply this platform to tissue specimens taken before and after
CAR T cell infusion from five CAR T cell clinical trials. These trials focus on pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer,
and highly active IL-18-secreting CAR T cells in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Dr. Rech will leverage the significant
differences in the TME in these diseases to understand the principles of response and resistance to therapy.
 Dr. Rech’s overarching hypothesis is that CAR T cell function and therapeutic efficacy are constrained
by specific, actionable interactions between tumor, CAR T cells, and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. His
preliminary data suggest that paracrine interactions between CAR T cells and myeloid cells could limit CAR T
cell function and be linked to hyperinflammatory toxicity. In Aim 1, Dr. Rech will define the tumor and stromal
features that influence CAR T cell tumor infiltration and function. In Aim 2, he will determine the impact of CAR
T cell functional profile on myeloid tumor stroma. Lastly, in Aim 3, Dr. Rech will determine the impact of CAR
T cell functional profile on tumor cell plasticity and antigenicity. In each Aim, he will also develop a relevant
murine model to validate results mechanistically and enable a path to future phase I clinical trials. In summary,
the spatial multi-omic profiling Dr. Rech proposes will identify response, resistance, and toxicity pathways that
impact CAR T cell therapy in patients and that can be targeted to improve therapy.
 In this proposal, Dr. Rech leverages his background as an interdisciplinary wet lab scientist,
computational scientist, and board-certified pathologist. He has developed a new line of investigation that is
distinct from the research of current and previous mentors and has already achieved major landmarks of scientific
independence. Dr. Rech has also garnered substantial institutional support at the University of Pennsylvania, a
globally recognized leader in the field of T cell engineering. Along with his mentors and department, Dr. Rech
has designed a six-component career development plan to facilitate his transition to independence. In
summary, the proposed studies will identify TME response mechanisms to CAR T cell therapy in
unprecedented detail in humans, guiding the development of next-generation CAR T cell therapy. The proposal
also enables Dr. Rech to launch his independent career in the unexplored scientific area of understanding how
engineered immune cells can reorganize the TME."

Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have been developed to deliver cytotoxic payloads (CTPs) to patients, yet their efficacy
is limited by serum instability, low tissue/tumor penetration, low cell internalization, and immunogenicity. Unstable linkers
further impair the utility of ADCs leading to off-target toxicities, non-specific CTP conjugations and heterogeneity of Drug
Antibody Ratios (DARs). Clinical trials have highlighted the diminished bioactivity of ADCs resulting from conjugations
at natural residues critical to epitope binding or structural integrity, yielding only 11 FDA approved ADC therapeutics.
Notably, two ADCs, Myolotarg (re-approved) and Blenrep were withdrawn from FDA approval due to safety concerns.
Nanobodies (Nbs), derived from heavy chain camelid antibodies, have enhanced therapeutic properties due to their small
size (~15 KDa vs. 150 KDa for Abs), and convex paratopes, which enable binding to unique epitopes inaccessible to Abs,
and improved intra-cellular delivery of CTPs yielding more efficacious therapeutics. Nevertheless, the small size of Nbs is
a double-edged sword limiting their utility with short half-lives (1-2 hours), necessitating frequent dosing and unfavorable
peak-valley pharmacokinetics with dose-limiting toxicities. Current strategies to extend their half-life (e.g., fusion to
albumin) create bulky molecules impairing tumor penetration. Anti- polyethylene glycol (PEG)-antibodies have similarly
limited clinical efficacy of therapeutics with notable recent failures of pegilodecakin (PEG-IL-10), toxicity from Doxil
(PEG-Doxurubicin) and reduced therapeutic efficacy of Oncaspar (PEG-asparginase). Pearl Bio’s innovative synthetic
biology platform can overcome these challenges by combining Genomically Recoded Organisms and orthogonal translation
systems to produce Nbs with 1-10 synthetic amino acids (sAAs) for precise tuning of therapeutic properties: (i) lipidation
for half-life tunability, (ii) tunable fluorescence-tagging for tumor detection and (iii) tunable DAR-specific CTP conjugation
with predictable homogenous products for enhanced tumor cytotoxicity. Our technology further enables multi-site encoding
of 2+ distinct sAAs within one Nb, enabling multi-functionalization and combination of these properties without
compromising tumor penetration or triggering immunogenicity. Building upon our prior work on anti-EGFR Nb (a target
validated for primary tumors and metastases) and EgA1, we will demonstrate multi-site sAA incorporation, lipidation and
CTP conjugation. Specifically, we will (1) demonstrate expression of engineered EgA1 Nb encoded with multiple sAAs,
(2) show precise conjugation of EgA1 with fluorophores, lipidated moieties, and cytotoxic payloads at sites of sAA
incorporation and (3) characterize tumor-cell targeted EgA1 nanobodies functionalized with lipids, fluorophores, and
cytotoxic payloads for tumor cell-binding, detection, and cytotoxicity. Phase 2 animal studies would be used to validate
these designs. This project is poised to establish Pearl’s platform as foundational technology for producing novel multi-
functionalized Nb biologics across diverse disease indications."

Surgical removal of the larynx profoundly affects a patient’s quality of life, particularly in the loss of normal
vocalization, physical change in appearance, and emotional challenges to adapt to living a normal life. Post
operatively, a laryngectomy requires a patient’s stoma to be protected utilizing various heat moister exchange
(HME) filters, which attach with devices either (i) extraluminal using adhesives and straps around the stoma or
(ii) intraluminal using a tracheostomal button (“TE Button”) inserted into the stoma. Utilization of either device is
challenging for the patient, extraluminal adhesive-based devices require change several times per week, causing
tissue irritation and injury, social and emotional stress, frustration, and device failure. The existing products for
laryngectomy patients have been void of meaningful innovation for over 20 years, utilizing antiquated materials
while ignoring the vast number of innovations in biocompatible materials and technology that could address most
patient issues. TE Button failure is easily identifiable and the byproduct of TE Buttons’ circular and rigid design
which unevenly displaces pressure due to lack of uniformity unique to each laryngectomy regarding
tracheostomal anatomy. This results in poor tolerability and retention due to dermal irritation, tissue erosion, and
random dislodging from the stoma caused by the device’s movement within the tracheal lumen during normal
daily activities, speech, and respiration. Most laryngectomy patients have undergone months or years of
traumatic surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation then attempt to reenter society with significant changes in
physical appearance, social anxieties, emotional stress, and frustration as they adapt to their ‘new’ normal quality
of life. TE Button failures limit a patient’s ability to successfully utilize various intraluminal attachments such as
a Tracheoesophageal (TE) voice restoration devices for hands-free TE speech production. These TE Button
failures reduce quality of life, impeding the ability to return to normal daily routines and activities after total
removal of their larynx. This Phase I proposal aims to develop a TE Button capable of improved stability,
durability, reduced pistoning and relative motion because it adapts to various stomal geometries and
configurations. This project will provide an alternative for hands-free speech production to patients who are
unable to use currently available intraluminal devices. We aim to utilize the advances in material sciences that
have occurred since the original tracheostoma buttons were invented. These include high elongation, high tear
strength, low durometer silicone elastomers and the lower cost of Nitinol wire and composites of wire such as
braids and stents."

Fabry disease is a rare inherited genetic disorder that is estimated to affect 1 in every 40,000 to 117,000
people. It is characterized by a deficiency of GLA enzymes (α-galactosidase A) that leads to harmful buildup of
glycolipids in all tissues, causing disabling multi-organ disease and life-threatening complications over time.
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in the form of intravenous GLA enzyme infusions has advanced Fabry
disease care. Although clinically effective, current ERT treatment requires frequent, life-long intravenous
infusions that are highly burdensome for patients. For example, in adults, biweekly peripheral venous injections
lead to lost productivity and potential vein damage. Meanwhile, in children, surgical placement of infusion ports
risks infection, restricts daily physical activities, and may lead to social anxiety and discrimination. These
burdens diminish patient quality of life, discourage early treatment initiation, and limit wider adoption.
Currently, various treatments such as biosimilars, modified ERTs, inhibitors, and gene therapy, are being
developed to improve therapeutic experience. However, the majority of emerging treatments still use the
intravenous format and provide few additional patient and cost benefits. Among prospective treatments, gene
therapy has shown the most promise. But recent clinical trials of viral gene therapies have resulted in
concerning side effects and inconsistent clinical efficacy, which diminishes the overall prospects of this
approach. Therefore, given the unclear outlook of emerging treatments, it is critical to develop more practical
and reliable therapies that improve the well-being of all Fabry patients.
Kinetiq is developing a pen-injector subcutaneous ERT for Fabry disease to reduce treatment burden and
expand patient accessibility. This self-administrable therapy will transform ERT into a convenient outpatient
treatment and significantly enhance patient quality of life, lower hospital use, and reduce treatment costs. As
part of our initial product development efforts, we demonstrated that our subcutaneous ERT (named BrySQ)
was favorably absorbed under physiological conditions into key body organs in healthy rodents.
In this SBIR Phase I proposal, we will conduct therapeutic feasibility studies of BrySQ in Fabry disease mice.
Following BrySQ intervention, we will evaluate drug distribution in heart and kidney tissues (Aim 1) and
quantify the resulting glycolipid reduction efficacy (Aim 2) using histology and mass spectrometry methods.
Once feasibility is established, we plan to conduct additional studies in a future SBIR Phase II study to

development of our BrySQ approach could potentially transform the current standard of care for Fabry and

10920336,"Abstract
Patients diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) face a challenging treatment landscape, with
limited options consisting mainly of blood transfusions and hypomethylating agents. This therapeutic regimen
has remained stagnant for the past two decades. Adding to the complexity, a significant concern is that
approximately one-third of MDS patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a condition that, while
relatively rare (with around 20,000 cases per year), becomes more prevalent among the elderly population.
The sole curative therapy for medically fit patients with AML remains high-dose induction chemotherapy
followed by hematopoietic stem cell therapy. Unfortunately, this approach has not significantly improved the
overall 5-year survival rates, which have stagnated at 29.5%. For medically unfit or frail elderly patients, the
outlook is even more dismal, with a 5-year survival rate plummeting to 7.3% and a median survival time of
just 7.3 months.
Recent advancements in targeted therapies have provided some hope, specifically for subsets of AML
patients harboring specific mutations (e.g., Flt3, IDH, and Bcl2). Medications like Midostaurine, enasidenib,
and Venetoclax have been approved for those who cannot undergo high-dose chemotherapy. However,
these therapies are associated with a high relapse rate due to the genetically unstable nature of AML,
resulting in only marginal improvements in median survival compared to low-dose chemotherapy or
hypomethylation inhibitors. Moreover, they come with their own set of adverse side effects. Consequently,
there is an urgent and unmet medical need for innovative approaches to treat both MDS and AML.
Our research has identified a promising lead antibody candidate that specifically targets Jagged-1, thereby
blocking a critical oncogenic pathway originating from the stable bone marrow stromal compartment in the
leukemic stem cell (LSC) tumor microenvironment (TME). This pathway promotes the proliferation and
survival of LSCs. The lead antibody disrupts the interaction between upregulated Jagged-1 on osteoblasts
and Notch-1 expressed on LSCs, leading to the inhibition of leukemic blast proliferation, induction of
apoptosis, and reversal of myeloid block in a mouse model of this pathway. It has also displayed
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MDS or AML blast cells in co-cultures involving osteoblasts and
blast cells from individual patients whose osteoblasts exhibit elevated activated Jagged-1.
In this Direct to Phase II proposal, we outline our plan to conduct preliminary IND-enabling studies,
encompassing cell line development, early chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) activities, as well
as preliminary toxicology studies, aiming to advance our program closer to clinical proof-of-concept studies."
10923790,"This proposal is a response to PAS-19-241, Stimulating Urology Interdisciplinary Team 
Opportunity Research, the aim of which is to promote innovative, high-quality, 
interdisciplinary research relevant to the NIDDK. Importantly, this PAS and a prior 
workshop identified psychosocial factors in women with urinary incontinence as an important 
knowledge gap. To this end, we bring together experts from behavioral sciences, urology, molecular 
 pathology, and regenerative medicine to explore further our initial findings that 
socially subordinate female monkeys do not respond as well to cell therapy for urinary incontinence 
as their dominant counterparts. We now propose a more comprehensive approach to assess (a) 
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) arousal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation, and 
 impaired ovarian function in socially housed monkeys; and (b) the likely pathways by 
which social subordination stress affects structural and functional regeneration within 
the urinary sphincter. Two likely pathways through which social subordination stress may 
modulate these processes are cortisol and SNS effects on tissue and cell damaging inflammation and 
estrogen-deficiency-associated inhibition of cell mobilization. These processes are not mutually 
exclusive and may involve the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway. Based on our previous 
studies and the published literature, our central hypothesis is that psychosocial stress 
inhibits the regenerative effects of cell therapy by reducing the mobilization of tissue 
healing bone marrow progenitor cells, and increasing the presence of hematopoietic tissue 
damaging inflammatory cells in the urinary sphincter. This hypothesis will be tested in a 
prospective, randomized, nonhuman primate preclinical trial using our well-characterized female 
cynomolgus monkey model of psychosocial stress due to social subordination, and our model of 
intrinsic urinary sphincter deficiency. Our Specific Aims are to determine the effect of 
 social status on: 1) the structural (cellular, acellular, vascular, innervation) and 
functional (urinary sphincter and bladder) effects of autologous skMPC therapy in female 
primates with ISD; 2) The injected lenti-M-cherry+ skMPC cell retention in, and lenti GFP+ labeled 
bone marrow cell mobilization to, the urinary sphincter of dominant and subordinate monkeys; 3) The 
effect of social subordination stress on abundance and polarization of inflammatory 
cells and associated molecules in the urinary sphincter; and 4) Whether social status 
effects on cell therapy-induced tissue regeneration are mediated by behavioral stress, SNS, 
HPA, or ovarian function. The results of this translational research will promote understanding 
of limitations and potential future regenerative medicine strategies for women with urinary 
incontinence."

 Students are selected from a highly qualified pool of applicants using holistic admissions criteria,
including dedication to science, research background, and perseverance, in addition to quantitative metrics.
Through substantial efforts to encourage applications from URM students and assistance from a strong
institutional diversity program, the PMB recruits a highly diverse and talented cohort of trainees. Each year,
eight students matriculate into the PMB and are supported for two years by the training grant, with stipend and
tuition supplements provided by Johns Hopkins University. First-year coursework is designed specifically for
PMB trainees, using active-learning techniques, such as recently designed ""Methods Modules,"" in which
graduate-level theoretical instruction is directly linked to actual data collection and analysis. Other courses
include fundamental aspects of biomolecules, scientific computing, along with statistics, data analysis, and
reproducibility. From the beginning, soft-skill and career development are integrated in the curriculum; one
example is a writing workshop organized in a collaboration between the PMB and the JHU Expository Writing
Program. Through PMB career development activities along with JHU resources, these skills help propel PMB
graduates to advanced positions in diverse biomedical science. Instruction and promotion of responsible
conduct of research is interwoven throughout the entire training program.
 Progress with independent research is carefully monitored through internal committee assessment, as
well as external mentor assessment. Through a mentoring mechanism that provides early guidance
transitioning to independence, trainees perform high impact thesis research, resulting in a large number of
publications, talks, and advanced positions following graduation. To continue to improve our training program,
the PMB has instituted a comprehensive annual external assessment through partnership with JHU's Center
for Educational Resources. The activities of the PMB are designed to contribute to fundamental scientific
research and train responsible scientists who will become leaders in the biomedical workforce."
10926935,"PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this P01 is to develop non immunosuppressive strategies to prevent and treat
gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD, which remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality. In working toward
this goal in the current cycle, we focused on understanding the role of target tissue intrinsic mechanisms of
resilience in regulation of GVHD. We uncovered an exciting, previously unknown role for metabolic
aberrations in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and their regulation by microbial metabolites in regulating
the severity of GI GVHD. Work published in the current cycle identified a key role for IECs in the protection
mediated by short chain fatty acids such as butyrate and propionate. Unpublished preliminary data
generated by us identified a profound defect in mitochondrial complex II (MC II), specifically reduction of its
component, succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA), in IECs that contributed to greater severity of GI GVHD.
These studies have identified a key role for SDHA in bulk IECs, which is made up of a number of distinct
subsets. Emerging data in recent years suggest that quantitative loss of only a few key IEC subsets,
specifically Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell (ISCs) and Paneth cell subsets are critical features of severe GI
GVHD. But the cell intrinsic pathways that are critical for their function and maintenance remain unknown.
Our new preliminary data demonstrate that the mitochondrial metabolic defect, reduction of SDHA
component of the mitochondrial complex II (MC II), in the bulk IECs, is also observed in the ISC subset. In
this project, we will build on these exciting and seminal preliminary observations and explore the role of
mitochondrial metabolic and bioenergetics functions in the biology of ISC and its contribution to tissue
resilience in mitigating the severity of GI GVHD. Specifically, we will test the central hypothesis that the cell
autonomous deficiency of mitochondrial complex II component, SDHA, in the host Lgr5+ ISCs regulates
its metabolism and amplifies GI GVHD. The specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To determine the functional
relevance of mitochondrial complex II component (SDHA) in host Lgr5+ ISCs to GI GVHD and Specific
Aim 2: To determine the impact of mitochondrial complex II SDHA deficiency on the biology of Lgr5+ ISC.
Collectively, our proposal will probe the previously unexplored biology of ISC intrinsic pathways that are
critical for regulation of GI GVHD severity. Importantly, it is thematically synergistic with other projects in
the P01 with a focus on ISCs, is grounded by novel preliminary data, and is supported by state of the art
Cores. If successful, our proposal will provide seminal insights into fundamental biology of ISCs will provide
novel targets to mitigate GI GVHD without adding more immune suppression."
10926936,"Project Summary/Abstract - Shared Resources Management
Eight CCSG-supported Shared Resources (SRs) provide cost-effective access to technologies and services to
UNMCCC members. The SRs have been developed to complement but not overlap with other cores or shared
resources at UNM. They are managed centrally by the Cancer Center Research Administration (CCRA) and
Scott Ness, Ph.D. (CMO), Associate Director for Shared Resources. All of the SRs have a faculty Director who
receives salary support from the CCSG and who participate in regular meetings with Senior Leaders and
Program Leaders. Five SRs charge user fees (Analytical & Translational Genomics, Animal Models &
Imaging, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence Microscopy & Cell Imaging, Human Tissue Repository & Tissue
Analysis) and utilize a centralized billing system for tracking utilization. Three (Bioinformatics, Biostatistics,
Behavioral Measurement & Population Science) operate with a collaborative model, tracking usage as faculty
or staff effort recovered on grants. User feedback is collected through several mechanisms, including oversight
committees, research program meetings and anonymous surveys, and the results are used by Ness, the senior
leadership and the SR Directors to improve and strategically develop the SRs. During the previous funding period
three SRs (Animal Models & Imaging, Bioinformatics and Flow Cytometry) were significantly reorganized in
response to this feedback and have shown dramatic improvements in utilization and user feedback. The SRs
have demonstrated consistent growth in demand and in user fees collected, including continued overall growth
since the last CCSG renewal in 2015 and nearly 3-fold growth since our first CCSG renewal in 2010. This growth
reflects continuous improvements and significant investments made by UNMCCC, including $2.2 million for new
instrumentation and renovation costs, $500,000 in non-CCSG cost sharing benefits that reduce the charges for
members and $265,610 in SR-focused pilot grants that generated $4.8 million (direct costs) in extramural grant
funding. An example of continuous improvement is the Behavioral Measurement & Population Science
Shared Resource, which was developing but has now been promoted to a full SR. In this renewal application,
CCSG funds are requested to support a new developing Translational Science Shared Resource, which will
facilitate the translation of discoveries from UNMCCC investigators to clinical trials, integrating correlative studies
with ongoing clinical trials at UNMCCC, interfacing with the other SRs to promote collaborations among clinical
and basic/translational investigators while supporting the recruitment and retention of clinician-scientists. In the
current funding period, CCSG funds supported 23% of the operating budgets for the SRs, which were
predominantly used by UNMCCC members. During the previous 5 year, total chargebacks (billing) for the SRs
was over $3 million, the SRs supported 139 peer-reviewed NIH grants ($49 million in total funding) and 128
current and former UNMCCC members from all three Research Programs used the SRs."
10926937,"PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT
GI GVHD remains the major cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality (NRM) after HCT. We
discovered that a major cause of GI crypt destruction is the accelerated death of intestinal stem cells
(ISCs), which is mediated by activation of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). Our data show
that inhibition of RIPK1 with two compounds specific for RIPK1, Necrostatin-1s and GNE684, prevent
ISC damage in organoid culture and in two experimental models of GVHD. We have also shown that the
Paneth cell protein regenerative 3γ (REG3γ) that is lost from the crypt during GVHD is a critical anti-
apoptotic protein and inhibits the activation of RIPK1, rescuing ISCs from GVHD and reducing mortality.
These findings support the central hypothesis of Project 2 that inhibition of RIPK1 activation prevents ISC
loss and allows regeneration of crypts, thus reducing GVHD. Our three specific aims will investigate this
hypothesis. Specific Aim 1: To determine the role of RIPK1 activation in ISC damage and GVHD. We
will first use systemic administration of pharmacological inhibitors of RIPK1 in well-defined mouse models
to treat and prevent GVHD, with detailed analyses of GVHD severity of the GI tract, correlating metrics
of crypt histopathology, RIPK1 expression and activation. We will complement these analyses using
mutant HCT recipient mice with inactive forms of RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins. We will also analyze the
effect of RIPK1 inhibitors on GVL effects using two leukemic cell lines. In human GI biopsies, we will
analyze phospo-RIPK1 expression as a biomarker of GVHD severity and as a predictor of long term
outcomes. These studies will complement and expand the preclinical data that form the rationale for the
Phase 2 trial of RIPK1 inhibition in high risk patients in Project 3. Specific Aim 2: To analyze the effect of
REG3γ on RIPK1 activation. This specific aim will investigate the role of REG3γ on the expression of
Complex I/II components and the role of TNFα and RIPK1 on REG3γ expression. In summary, these
studies will illuminate the key mechanisms by which inhibition of RIPK1 prevents the inflammatory cell
death that causes GI crypt damage during GVHD and thus will lead to novel strategies to control this
major cause of NRM after allogeneic BMT."
10926938,"PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT
Gastrointestinal (GI) graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) remains the major cause of non-relapse mortality
(NRM) after hematopoietic cell transplant but GVHD symptom severity at onset predicts outcomes too
poorly to guide treatment and thus all patients are treated with prolonged courses of high dose systemic
steroids, under treating some and over treating others. Steroid treatment for GVHD is itself a major cause
of morbidity and complications include infections, reduced physical function, and poor quality of life
(QOL). In the current cycle, we developed and validated the MAGIC algorithm probability (MAP), which
combines two serum GI GVHD biomarkers into a single value that measures the extent of GI crypt
damage. The MAP predicts clinical outcomes such as response to treatment and NRM more accurately
than clinical severity alone and thresholds categorize patients into high or low risk groups. Patients with
high risk GVHD (35% of GVHD) account for 75% of NRM. In contrast, our preliminary data show that a
subset of patients with low risk GVHD who exhibit both clinical and biomarker responses during the first
two weeks of treatment represent an ultra-low risk population with 91% response to steroids and 2%
NRM. Ultra-low risk patients comprise 40% of all GVHD. Our central hypothesis is that biomarker-guided,
risk adapted treatment of GVHD will improve outcomes. We will test this hypothesis in two clinical trials.
Specific Aim 1 leverages the discovery in Project 2 that activation of RIPK1 causes destruction of
intestinal stem cells and its inhibition can both prevent and reverse GI GVHD in preclinical models. In this
Aim, we will conduct a multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial to test whether the addition of a RIPK1 inhibitor
to steroid treatment in patients with high risk GVHD increases treatment response rates and decreases
NRM. In Specific Aim 2 we will conduct a Phase 2 multicenter clinical trial that tests whether ultra-low
risk GVHD can be successfully treated with a brief exposure to steroids. We will use real-time clinical and
biomarker monitoring to reduce steroid exposure by more than 50%. We will quantify the efficacy of this
approach by comparing the frequency of severe infections in trial patients to a well matched
contemporaneous control cohort. In a subaim, we will test whether our approach improves QOL as
measured by patient reported outcomes in cases compared to controls. These two trials thus use
innovative and complementary, risk-adapted treatment strategies to treat both high and low risk GVHD.
If the trials are successful, we will have devised new treatments for the large majority of patients who
develop GVHD and will have addressed the under-treatment of high risk GVHD as well as the over-
treatment of low risk GVHD.

10926940,"ABSTRACT: Funded in part as a Minority/Underserved NCI Community Oncology Research Program 
(NCORP; 2UG1CA189856-06; Muller, PI (CT)), Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) at the 
University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) is overseen by a centralized Clinical 
Research Office (CRO) for all cancer clinical research performed at UNMCCC and within our statewide 501c3 
cancer clinical trials network with community health providers (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance; 
NMCCA). The overarching goals of CPDM are to provide expert high quality central management to 
ensure all cancer clinical trials: 1) are aligned with UNMCCC science; 2) address cancer patterns and needs 
of the diverse New Mexico catchment area; 3) are performed under the highest quality and rigor; 4) meet 
federal and institutional regulations; and 5) are monitored for performance, compliance and patient safety. 
Clinical research at UNMCCC is led by Carolyn Muller, MD (Associate Director for Clinical Research (CT))
and Ursa Brown-Glaberman, MD (Medical Director of the CRO/CPDM (CT)). In 2018, to assure operational 
improvement, efficiency, and increased compliance, the UNMCCC recognized the need to modernize and 
restructure the relationship between UNM and NMCCA. With assistance from Huron Consulting, a robust 
evaluation and process improvement project began, leading to a new collaborative model implemented in 
2019-2020. This model assures continued community participation by retaining the NMCCA 501c3, but 
moved and centralized all operations and staff (budgeting/contracting, trial activation, regulatory, quality 
assurance, auditing/ monitoring, training, and informatics) within the UNMCCC CRO/CPDM, now serving both 
UNMCCC and NMCCA. While necessitating a slowing of accruals in 2019-2020, the new structure is ensuring
higher quality performance, increased CPDM oversight, greater community engagement and catchment area
impact, and, is poised to achieve more robust accrual in the future. In this grant period, within our catchment 
area’s population of 2.1 million people (63% racial/ethnic minorities, 40% insured by Medicaid, and 13.4% 
(age 18-64) uninsured), there were 7395 total accruals (2654 intervention and 4741 non-intervention). While 
COVID-19 severely impacted accruals in 2020, in 2019, CPDM supported the recruitment of 1361 accruals
to 206 active clinical research protocols at UNMCCC (455 interventional and 906 non-interventional accruals) 
and 149 total accruals (135 interventional, and 14 non-interventional, 93% supporting NCORP) from NMCCA
affiliate sites. The CPDM performs robust auditing and data safety monitoring of investigator-initiated trials 
(IITs) across all sites engaged in UNM IITs under the 2020 updated DSMP. In 2019 and 2020 Q1-2 women 
represented 82% and 76% of interventional trial accruals respectively. Accruals of Hispanic (32%, 43%) and 
American Indian (10%, 9%) data across intervention trials align with the race and ethnic population of cancer 
patients in NM (2019, 2020). Intervention accruals span all ages with 28% > 65 years of age in 2019."
10920778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease is associated with multiple factors, including but not limited to amyloid plaque formation, tau
protein entanglement, enzyme degradation and inflammation. Inflammation is implicated in many aging diseases
and in the central nervous system (CNS) is associated with the CCR5 gene that increases with age. CCR5 has
been correlated with impairments in memory consolidation in aged mice, which was reversed with a CCR5
knockout and an FDA approved drug that inhibits this receptor.
We propose to develop targeted nanoparticles of an anti-CCR5 drug, and evaluate its impact on brain
inflammation and AD. In Phase I, we will: (i) Nanoencapsulate anti-CCR5 drug in targeted and non-targeted,
long circulating, pegylated nanoparticles utilizing a proprietary solvent-free technology, and characterize the size
and distribution of the nanoparticles, encapsulation or loading efficiency, and in vitro release characteristics; and
(ii) Evaluate the impact of the anti-CCR5 drug nanoparticles on in vitro models of brain inflammation and BBB
penetration to select best candidates for in vivo studies, perform pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and toxicity
studies in wild-type mice and efficacy studies in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In Phase II,
we will more rigorously characterize the nanoparticles, conduct extensive in vitro and in vivo studies, and scale-
up manufacturing towards conducting IND-enabling studies and filing an IND for Phase I and/or Phase IIb studies.
We will then out-license the developed technologies and products to a multinational pharmaceutical or
biotechnology company."
10923916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Degenerative vision disorders are caused by the loss of retinal cells. In zebrafish, retinal Müller glial (MG) act
as stem cells, generating MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) which replace lost retinal cells. Mammalian
MG/MGPCs can also produce new retinal neurons, however, proliferative capacity is limited and disease-
relevant cell types (e.g., photoreceptors) are rarely generated. Our goal is to understand why the regenerative
potential of MG/MGPCs are limited in mammals in comparison to a regenerative species (i.e. zebrafish).
In zebrafish, widespread retinal cell loss triggers “developmental” regeneration, producing all major retinal cell
classes. Conversely, selective retinal cell loss results in a “fate-biased” process where MGPCs give rise to the
lost cell type. How MG sense the extent of loss, however, is unknown. As the immune system plays critical
roles during retinal regeneration, we examined the impact of microglia reactivity on MG activation in zebrafish.
We observed that microglia are required for MG stem cell activation and that immunosuppression can inhibit or
enhance regeneration kinetics depending on the treatment timing. We hypothesize that microglia reactivity
levels scale to the extent, duration, and/or specificity of retinal cell loss in order to coordinate MG
activation, MGPC proliferation rates and fat decisions to the type of injury incurred. To test our
hypothesis, here we propose to combine an improved targeted cell ablation system enabling titratable,
sustainable, and selective retinal cell loss with resources/methods for labeling of immune cell types, intravital
timelapse imaging, lineage tracing, and single cell transcriptomics. Specifically we will define how the extent
(Aim 1), the duration (Aim 2) and specificity (Aim 3) of cone photoreceptor or retinal ganglion cell loss impact
immune cell reactivity and retinal regeneration. These experiments will serve to define roles specific immune
cell subtypes play in shaping MGPC proliferation and cell fates during regeneration in zebrafish."
10923917,"Project Summary
 Metastatic disease is the primary cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, resulting in >10 million deaths
worldwide in 2020. Despite recent advances in our knowledge of metastatic tumor development, there is a critical
need to understand the molecular mechanisms by which discrete subpopulations of neoplastic cells successfully
enter circulation to improve strategies for monitoring and reducing metastatic disease burden. Our team
discovered a unique disseminated neoplastic cell subtype characterized by co-expression of neoplastic and
immune cell genotypes and phenotypes that can form from neoplastic-macrophage cell fusion. These hybrid
cells are found in peripheral blood at numbers greater than other circulating tumor-derived cells (CTCs) and
exhibit increased migratory and invasive potential as well as the ability to seed and expand at metastatic sites at
rates greater than CTCs. However, the mechanisms by which hybrid cells do so is currently unknown. In my
preliminary analyses of hybrid cell gene expression, I identified upregulated components from the Runt-related
transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) pathway in hybrid cells compared to tumor cells. RUNX1 is a transcription factor
that regulates hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and macrophage migration and has been shown to mediate
metastatic conversion of tumor cells by facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer. In a
hybrid cell, RUNX1 may integrate the functional behaviors of both macrophages and tumor cells into a single
cell and facilitate their successful dissemination. Therefore, I hypothesize that disseminated subpopulations of
neoplastic hybrid cells display differential RUNX1 meditated ~omics and functional expression that facilitates
enhanced tumor dissemination.
 This project proposes to first assess the gene expression and phenotypic profiles of hybrid cells in colorectal
cancer tumors and peripheral blood to identify characteristics of hybrid cells that successfully disseminate.
Additionally, this project will evaluate the functional role of RUNX1 in facilitating enhanced hybrid cell migration
and dissemination. Successful completion of these studies will define the molecular underpinnings of neoplastic
hybrid cell migration and dissemination and will provide the basis for future exploration of this unique neoplastic
subtype as a biomarker for the detection of early metastatic disease and tumor evolution.
 Furthermore, this application proposes a comprehensive and interdisciplinary training plan within a prominent
academic medical and research institution that seamlessly integrates with the research proposal, providing
essential training in systems and molecular cancer biology to support the candidates career goal of maintaining
an academic translational oncology laboratory as a physician scientist."

10916329,"Project 2: Project Summary/Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication
deficits, sensory abnormalities, and restricted/repetitive behaviors (RRB). Disrupted sleep is usually described
as the one of the most burdensome symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD with rate of up to 80%.
Animal studies demonstrate that sleep plays important roles in structural plasticity of synaptic networks,
homeostatic rebalancing of synaptic strengths and the replay and consolidation of memories. In humans,
sleep disruption is well documented to impair cognition and affect. In fact, parent reports have found
insufficient sleep in individuals with ASD to exacerbate the severity of core symptoms, with increased RRB as
well as worsening of social communication deficits. Therefore, increasing our understanding of sleep
physiology and improving sleep in ASD is critical for the potential development of interventions that could
benefit core autism features as well as in associated behaviors. While there is increased interest in the
neurobiology of ASD, limited research has been conducted to elucidate the neurobiology of sleep
disturbances. Recent investigations have provided evidence that children with ASD had shorter total sleep
time, greater slow-wave sleep percentage, and much less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage.
However, despite the consistent findings of sleep abnormalities in ASD, limited studies have examined the
effectiveness of pharmacological compounds on sleep physiology. Critically, there is a lack of investigations
assessing the biologic effects of hypnotic agents on sleep architecture. The goal of the proposed project is to
conduct a series of pilot trials to investigate the effect of three sleep-inducing agents with different mechanisms
(diphenhydramine, zolpidem, and suvorexant) on sleep architecture in children and adolescents with ASD (age
range 8-17 years). Diphenhydramine is an anti-histaminergic agent with strong hypnotic properties. Zolpidem is
a nonbenzodiazepine Gamma Aminobutyric Acid-GABAa receptor agonist drug which acts as a sedative and
hypnotic. Suvorexant is a selective, dual orexin receptor antagonist used for the treatment of sleep onset
difficulties and/or sleep maintenance. We will use a randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled 8-
week design to examine the effect of the 3 hypnotic compounds on sleep physiology and circadian rhythm as
assessed by polysomnography, actigraphy, cortisol and melatonin saliva levels. These measures will be
obtained before randomization, at week 4, and at week 8. Sleep measures will include slow wave sleep, Non-
REM sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep latency. We will also compare the
effect of the three agents on sleep parameters, circadian rhythm, and sleep quality. Finally, we will examine the
relationship between these measures and changes in the clinical features of ASD, including RRB, social
communication deficits and associated behaviors, including irritability and hyperactivity."
10916331,"HABS-HD Neuroimaging & Informatics Core (Core B) Abstract
The Neuroimaging & Informatics Core (Core B) is responsible for all neuroimaging acquisition protocols,
storage protocols, QA/QC protocols, processing pipelines, and long-term storage of raw scans for the Health
and Aging Brain Study- Health Disparities (HABS-HD) U19. The overall objective of Core B is to provide high
quality imaging and summary data for Projects 1, 2, and 3 and for all U19 investigators. Core B is led by Dr.
Arthur Toga (USC/LONI) and Co-Led by Dr. Meredith Braskie (USC/LONI/IGC). Images obtained as part of
HABS-HD are stored and managed within the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI). At initiation of the HABS-
HD U19, approximately 5,000 MRI scans and 6,000 PET scans will have been collected, stored and processed.
HABS-HD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition
largely aligns to standard ADNI3 protocols. Selected imaging modalities will be processed by Core B and
summary data will be uploaded to the HABS-HD database at 6-month intervals. All raw scans will also be
available. Core B will provide the amyloid (A), tau (T), neurodegeneration (N), for the AT(N) framework that
will be leveraged by Projects 1, 2 and 3, and will also provide summary vascular imaging data to be used by
Project 2. All neuroimaging for the HABS-HD program occurs at the University of North Texas Health Science
Center Institute for Translational Research (UNTHSC ITR) Imaging Center using the same MRI and PET
scanners. Core strengths include decades of experience developing and managing multisite, large data
projects. Under the leadership of Drs. Toga and Braskie and using the infrastructure of the USC Institute for
Neuroimaging and Informatics (INI), LONI and ATRI, we will provide multi-site data management and
dissemination of imaging and clinical data in a manner consistent with systems supporting the Alzheimer
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN),
Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI), and others. All Core B activities will support the U19 scientific
goals and the broader national AD and dementia research community. This first-ever comprehensive multimodal
study of AD risk using the AT(N) framework within the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. (75% of the
population) requires robust informatics, data management, and harmonization. Core B Aims are as follows: Aim
1: To create an imaging and informatics data management framework for all U19 Projects. Aim 2: To ensure
high quality control of all neuroimaging data. Aim 3: To deliver a harmonized analysis workflow for each imaging
modality that can accommodate any computational environment."
10916332,"Project 4: Project Summary/Abstract
Sleep is critical for proper synaptic connections and brain development. Our group previously established that
sleep disruptions in zebrafish, like in other species, prevent normal structural synapse plasticity. Conversely,
proper sleep and melatonin hypnotic/circadian treatment can improve these synaptic defects. Animal models
of ASD, like ASD patients, suffer from sleep disruptions during development and display synaptic and
behavioral deficiencies. Here, we hypothesize that sleep disruptions during development are causal
and/or aggravating factors of ASD synaptic and behavioral defects, and that sleep interventions could
alleviate these issues. While human (Projects 1 & 2) and mouse (Project 3) approaches permit exquisite
studies of social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and associated cortical synaptic defects, zebrafish is a
transparent vertebrate popular in developmental biology allowing whole brain and body investigation.
Importantly, ASD risk genes like Fmr1, Shank3, and Cntnap2 are pan-neuronal, and their loss likely impacts
the entire central nervous system during sleep. We have recently developed fluorescence-based
polysomnography (fPSG) in zebrafish, a novel, non-invasive method allowing whole-brain and whole-body
imaging with single cell resolution during sleep. Using fPSG, we have shown that zebrafish have sleep brain
dynamics analogous to mammals, including a state we coined slow bursting sleep (SBS) which shares many
commonalities with Non-REM slow wave sleep (SWS). Our preliminary data indicates that SBS is fragmented
in developing Fmr1 zebrafish mutants. Further, studies from other groups have shown that based on actimetry,
sleep/wake pattern is also disrupted in zebrafish cntnapt2ab and shank3ab mutants. However, their brain
activity during sleep has not yet been investigated. Thus, in Aim 1, we will apply fPSG to these three genotypes
(fmr1, shank3ab, and cntnap2ab mutants) and controls to fully characterize their sleep neural and muscular
dynamics during development. Next, we will apply the same pharmacological interventions (H1R antihistamine,
GABAA agonist, and hypocretin/orexin receptors antagonist) used in human (Project 2) and mouse (Project
3), to improve sleep onset latency and sleep/SBS consolidation in these ASD risk gene mutants. Then, in Aim
2, we will investigate the respective beneficial effects of these NREM/SWS/SBS-sleep interventions on
structural synapse density using longitudinal imaging of telencephalic, hypothalamic and spinal cord circuits
expressing synaptic proteins fused to fluorescent markers such as PSD95-eGFP, Synaptophysin-eGFP or
Gephyrin-eGFP. In parallel, treated fish will be assessed for improvement in repetitive and social behaviors
like in mouse (Project 3) and human (Project 2). Complementing the latter, the transparency of the zebrafish
model will reveal how sleep dynamics are disrupted throughout the entire brain and how sleep interventions
can also be beneficial for synaptic normalization throughout the CNS, further establishing the
causal/aggravating role of disrupted sleep in the development of autistic traits."

The long-term goal of the Health & Aging Brain Study – Health Disparities (HABS-HD) is to establish a
population-specific informed precision medicine for novel treatment and prevention strategies for Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) as called for in NIA AD+ADRD Milestone 1. The Clinical Core (Core C) will meet this goal by
continuing to conduct all direct participant interviews, assessments, imaging, and other protocol components
(parent study and/or ancillary studies). By the time of the initiation of the U19, the cohort will consist of 3,000
community-dwelling participants ages 50 and above (n=1,000 African Americans [AA], 1,000 Mexican
Americans [MA], and 1,000 non-Hispanic whites [NHW]). Visit one (V1) and 24-month longitudinal V2 data will
be available at initiation of the U19 among the MA and NHW participants with V1 data available for the AA
participants. As part of this U19, we will continue 24-month assessments of the existing cohort as well as enroll
an additional 1,500 participants (n=500 per racial/ethnic group; age 30-49) for a more comprehensive
examination of AT(N) defined biomarkers across adulthood among the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the
U.S. Core C is responsible for reviewing all data for assignment of research diagnoses (medical and cognitive)
as well as providing feedback to participants, families and health care providers as part of our “give back” to
the community as indicated during the informed consent process by the participant. The data collected by Core
C will be crucial for all Projects and will also be made available to the scientific community via LONI. The
Clinical Core Aims are as follows: Aim 1 (Data Capture): In collaboration with all Cores, continue to follow
harmonized protocols for the collection, processing, cataloging, storage and distribution of demographic,
clinical and imaging data in support of overall program goals. Aim 2 (CSF Substudy): Conduct cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) collection substudy. Aim 3 (Consensus Reviews and Feedback): Continue to conduct consensus
reviews to ensure appropriate assignment of research-based clinical diagnoses (cognitive and medical) and
provide feedback to participants, families and heath care providers as indicated during informed consent
process. Aim 4 (Collaboration): Collaborate with Cores and Projects. Aim 5 (Brain Bank): Build foundation,
community relations and infrastructure for future implementation of HABS-HD Brain Bank. Aim 6 (Cross-Study
Comparisons): Work collaboratively with other AD+ADRD projects and programs for cross-study comparisons
leveraging HABS-HD clinical data. In collaboration with the Administrative Core (Core A), work to ensure
cross-study comparisons with ongoing initiatives such as ADNI, WHICAP, SOL/INCA, LEADS, ABC-DS, New
IDEAS, ADCs and others."
10916338,"HABS-HD DISPARITIES & OUTREACH CORE (CORE E) - ABSTRACT
One of the primary goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) is to “improve outcomes for ethnic
and racial minority populations.” However, substantial gaps in understanding the reasons for the disparate
increase in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD related disorders (ADRDs) in ethnic and racial minority
populations exist, primarily due to the underrepresentation of minority groups in aging research. Community
engagement and outreach is considered one of the most successful strategies to recruiting diverse populations
into research. The Dallas Forth-Worth (DFW) metroplex, home to the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health
Disparities (HABS-HD), is currently reflective of the future U.S. racial/ethnic population and an ideal location
to simultaneously study cognitive aging among African Americans (AA), Mexican Americans (MA; 63% of the
U.S. Hispanic population) and non-Hispanic whites (NHW). HABS-HD is the first large-scale, community-based
project to simultaneously study each of the AT(N) defined biomarkers, in alignment with the NIA Health
Disparities Research Framework. The long-term goal of HABS-HD is to establish population-specific informed
precision medicine for novel treatment and prevention strategies as called for in NIA AD+ADRD Research
Implementation Milestone 1. For nearly 10 years, HABS-HD has built a network of community ties and
relationships using a community-based approach to recruitment. This approach, which emphasized outreach,
engagement, and collaboration between the research team and key stakeholders in the community, led to the
successful recruitment of 2,000 participants (n=1,000 NHW, 1,000 MA) aged 50 and older and longitudinal
follow-ups are underway. Based on UNTHSC Institutional funding, the cohort has expanded to include 1,000
AAs with recruitment to be completed prior to initiation of this U19. As part of the proposed U19, the primary
goal of the Core E is to further increase awareness and engagement of diverse communities into research and
to provide the outreach infrastructure to comprehensively understand the development and progression of AD
and ADRDs across the lifecourse. To address this goal, Core E will address the following Specific Aims: Aim
1: Extend the recruitment of the HABS-HD cohort to ages 30-49 (n=500 per racial/ethnic group), retain existing
participants, and recruit new participants to counteract attrition. Aim 2: Generate and disseminate educational
materials regarding the importance of brain aging over the lifecourse and the importance of research in diverse
communities. Aim 3: In collaboration with all Cores and Projects, continue to monitor and ensure that all
HABS-HD activities are conducted in alignment with the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework."

10916344,"HABS-HD DEVELOPMENT CORE - ABSTRACT
There is a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD related disorders (ADRDs) among
underrepresented groups (URGs), especially African American and Hispanic populations. This excess AD/ADRD
morbidity, and its attendant socioeconomic costs, is expected to get even larger given that older URG adults are
a rapidly expanding segment of the U.S. population. Specifically, epidemiological projections indicate that by
2060 the U.S. will become considerably “non-white,” as reflected by a 42% increase in the percentage of African
Americans and a 114% increase in the percentage of persons of Hispanic origin, compared to an 8.2% decrease
in the proportion of non-Hispanic whites. In light of this reality of an increasingly diverse U.S., it is imperative to
curate educational opportunities that foster the training of a diverse workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical,
behavioral, clinical and translational needs in AD/ADRDs. Such opportunities would help ensure the availability
of a pipeline of ethnoculturally/linguistically diverse and culturally competent professionals prepared to study,
evaluate, diagnose, and treat URG older adults with ADRDs. The need for such an initiative, at this point in time,
is further underscored by the fact that despite ongoing efforts at the federal level to facilitate the participation of
URGs in research careers, underrepresentation remains a persistent problem as evidenced by recent reports
from the National Science Foundation and others showing, as an example, that persons from a URG background
comprise only 5% of tenure-track neuroscience faculty despite making up a significantly larger slice of the U.S.
population. Therefore, the overarching objective of the Development Core of the Health & Aging Brain
Study – Health Disparities (HABS-HD) is to recruit, support, and provide targeted mentored training to
an annual cohort of URG trainees (graduate/professional students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career
investigators, to be known as HABS-HD Fellows) to ensure their research proficiency and cultural
competency. We will equip them with the conceptual knowledgebase, practical skillset, and allied resources
that will be beneficial for launching successful independent research careers in the AD/ADRD field. Trainees
from a non-URG background who have a commitment to health disparities research will also be considered for
this mentorship opportunity, as our ultimate goal is to address the current lack of an ethnoculturally/linguistically
diverse and culturally competent AD/ADRD workforce. To address our objective, the Development Core will
address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Deliver a targeted mentored training program to ensure research
proficiency and cultural competency. Aim 2. Measure the effectiveness of the HABS-HD mentored training
program."
10916346,"HABS-HD PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT
The 2018 AT(N) framework provided the field with the first biological conceptualization of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) for the explicit purpose of advancing clinical trials. In fact, the first amyloid-lowering drug (aducanumab)
recently received FDA approval. However, nearly all data supporting the framework itself, as well as the clinical
trials, comes from clinic-based research among non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals. By 2060, the U.S. will
become largely “non-white” with 15% of the population being African American (AA) and 27.5% being Hispanic
(65% of which are Mexican American [MA]). AAs currently have the highest burden of AD and AD related
dementias (ADRD) while Hispanics will experience the greatest increase in AD/ADRDs by 2060. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to understand the relevance of the AT(N) framework, and associated biomarker-based
therapeutics, for 43% of the U.S. population. Additionally, while there is a wealth of literature demonstrating
that factors in early adulthood have a significant impact on late-life dementia risk, our understanding of the
impact of these factors on the earliest signs and progression patterns of the fundamental biomarkers of AD
among diverse communities remains largely unknown. The Health & Aging Brain Study – Health Disparities
(HABS-HD) is the first large-scale, community-based project to simultaneously study each of the AT(N) defined
biomarkers across adulthood among the three most prevalent racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., AAs, MAs and
NHWs. The long-term goal of HABS-HD is to establish population-specific informed precision medicine for
novel AD treatment and prevention strategies in line with NIA AD+ADRD Milestone 1. Project 1 will test
the hypothesis that the timing, sequence, trajectories, progression and cognitive impact of the AT(N)
biomarkers differ among African Americans, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. Aim 1:
Examine the longitudinal sequence, trajectories, progression and cognitive impact of AT(N) defined biomarkers
among African Americans, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. Aim 2: Examine the utility of blood-
based biomarker profiles for screening for subsequent PET and/or MRI-based AT(N) confirmatory diagnostic
methods among Mexican Americans, African Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. Aim 3: Examine the impact
of genomic markers on AT(N) defined biomarkers among African Americans, Mexican Americans and non-
Hispanic whites. Aim 4: Collaborate with Projects 2 and 3 to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
impact of diverse biological, exposome, and sociocultural factors on AT(N) defined biomarkers across diverse
populations. Exploratory Aim 5: Compare AT(N) biomarker data from HABS-HD with that from other large-
scale initiatives such as ADNI, LEADS, ADCs, WHICAP, SOL/INCA, ABC-DS, New IDEAS and others."
10916348,"HABS-HD PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT
Milestone 1.I of the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) + Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD)
Implementation Milestones explicitly calls for testing “early mechanistic pathways of multiple etiologies that
may account for AD/ADRD health disparities”. Significant health disparities exist in the U.S. related to AD with
African Americans (AAs) currently suffering the highest burden of AD/ADRD while Hispanics (65% of which are
Mexican American [MA]) will experience the greatest increase in disease burden by 20602. MAs also develop
cognitive loss at significantly younger ages. Despite these factors, AAs and MAs remain underrepresented in
AD research. In fact, 83% of participants in the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Alzheimer’s Disease Centers
(ADC) and 90% of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)7 are non-Hispanic white (NHW).
Additionally, the 2018 AT(N) framework, which represents the mechanistic pathways (amyloid [A], tau [T],
neurodegeneration [N]) dominating the current clinical trial landscape, was built almost entirely on data from
NHWs who are screened out for most medical comorbidities. Nevertheless, emerging data demonstrates
racial/ethnic differences in AT(N) defined biomarkers and, therefore, the applicability of the framework to AAs
and MAs remains unknown, which is the focus of Project 1. AAs and MAs also suffer a heavier burden of
vascular, metabolic and inflammatory (VMI) factors, each of which have well-established links to AD, including
AT(N) biomarkers. Therefore, VMI factors may be targetable “early mechanistic pathways” that contribute to
AD health disparities that cannot be understood without inclusion of populations known to experience the
highest burden from them. Project 2 will evaluate the impact of VMI factors on the prevalence, sequence
and trajectories of AT(N) defined biomarkers and cognitive loss among the three largest racial/ethnic
groups in the U.S. Aim 1: Examine the impact of VMI factors on the presence and progression of cognitive
loss among African Americans, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. Aim 2: Examine the impact of
VMI factors on the presence, sequence and trajectories of AT(N) defined biomarkers among African
Americans, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. Aim 3: Determine if VMI factors explain the
racial/ethnic specific impact of APOEε4 genotype - and other VMI-related AD genetic markers - on AT(N)
defined biomarkers. Aim 4 (Project – Project Interactions): Collaborate with Projects 1 and 3 to develop a
comprehensive understanding of AT(N) defined biomarkers across diverse populations. Exploratory Aim 5:
Compare VMI data and VMI – AT(N) interaction data with that from other large-scale initiatives such as ADNI,

African Americans (AAs) currently suffer the highest burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s
Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) while Hispanics (65% of which are Mexican American [MA]) will
experience the greatest increase in disease burden by 2060. Additionally, emerging data supports racial/ethnic
differences in the fundamental pathological biomarkers of Amyloid (A), Tau (T), and Neurodegeneration (N) in
AD, as defined by the 2018 AT(N) framework (Project 1). Research also demonstrates a significant impact of
vascular, metabolic and inflammatory (VMI) factors on AD outcomes, which are experienced at higher rates
among AAs and MAs and, therefore, may impact AT(N) biomarkers (Project 2). Given that AAs and MAs
experience a disparate burden of exposome and sociocultural factors previously linked to AD outcomes, these
factors may contribute to observed AD health disparities and biomarker differences. In fact, the Link & Phelan
“Fundamental Causes Theory” proposes that social factors may be ‘fundamental causes’ of disease and must be
considered for successful intervention strategies. Milestones 1.B and 1.I of the NIA AD + ADRD
Implementation Milestones explicitly call for examinations of the impact of exposome and social factors on
AD/ADRD disparities. Therefore, Project 3 will evaluate the impact of exposome (i.e., neighborhood
disadvantage) and sociocultural (i.e., acculturation, stress, perceived racism) factors on the
prevalence, sequence and trajectories of cognitive decline as well as AT(N) defined biomarkers among
the three largest racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. Therefore, Project 3 will address the following Specific
Aims in alignment with the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework. Aim 1: Examine the link between
neighborhood disadvantage and sociocultural factors on the presence and longitudinal progression of cognitive

the impact of epigenetic factors on the link between neighborhood disadvantage and sociocultural factors on
AT(N) defined biomarkers, and cognitive trajectories, among African Americans, Mexican Americans and non-
Hispanic whites. Aim 4 (Project – Project Interactions): Collaborate with Projects 1 and 2 to develop a
comprehensive understanding of AT(N) defined biomarkers across diverse populations. Aim 5: Utilize data
from Project 3 as a comparison for other studies examining the impact of neighborhood disadvantage (e.g.,

10923850,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low
sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum,
biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB
requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more
likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the
support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can
achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this
objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for
intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from
children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that
have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim
2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that
can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with
functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the
smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic
test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an
independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker
discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted
high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children.
Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools
that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be
paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker
studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that
is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago
National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure
for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the
biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus,
the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to
become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB."
10923861,"Summary
The analysis of liquid biopsy (eg, cell-free DNA [cfDNA]; circulating tumor cells [CTC]) in blood is increasingly
integrated in clinical contexts including diagnosis, disease monitoring, understanding resistance, and early
detection of relapse. The key challenge of detecting these analytes is that they are present at a very low
proportion of the biospecimens, and therefore are heavily influenced by pre-analytical factors associated with
acquisition and processing. Understanding effects of these pre-analytical variables on the quality of data
generated in downstream molecular CTC and cfDNA assays is critical for robust clinical implementation of
liquid biopsy tests. To date, research efforts have focused on effects of preservation methods, processing time,
storage temp, and shipment conditions on quality of CTC and cfDNA in blood plasma. There are no studies
reported on effects of patient-specific context such as fasting, administration of anti-emetics, or biospecimen
acquisition procedures (eg, order of blood collection aliquots, time of day when blood is drawn, etc.) There is a
lack of data on this type of pre-analytical variable that impacts design of clinical trials such as optimal timing for
blood draw and interpretation of data to distinguish technical variables introduced by these pre-analytical
factors from the biological signals being evaluated. We propose to address this gap by extending the work
done by our team members on evaluating effects of sample processing protocols on cfDNA and CTC analysis,
to further investigate effect of patient-specific context. Hypothesis: Pre-analytic variables may affect signal-to-
noise ratio in cfDNA and CTC analysis and thus have a higher impact on quantification at levels close to the
assay limit of detection. Aim 1: Determine the effect of patient-specific context on the quality of cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) in prostate cancer patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of these
variables on the performance of downstream cfDNA and CTC molecular profiling assays. We will apply an
adaptive design in which we perform initial analysis with 20 patients per cohort, then adjust as needed. In a
foundation-funded pilot study, we focused on one cohort to study effect of draw order. Results confirm the
variability of biomarkers quantification as a result of pre-analytical variables.
Significance: Results will elucidate effects of multiple pre-analytical variables specific to individual patient
context on performance of blood-based biomarker analysis in cfDNA and CTC. These data will inform the
design of liquid biopsy-incorporated clinical trials by identifying optimal timing of blood collection to minimize
effects of pre-analytical variables. Innovation: This will be the first study to examine the effect of patient-
specific context on quality of liquid biopsy data. We will collaborate closely with commercial liquid biopsy test
developers as part of the Blood Profiling Atlas in Cancer (BloodPAC) project, with the goal of sharing
knowledge across different sectors and working toward harmonization of pre-analytical procedures for liquid
biopsy testing."

 The Biobehavioral Cancer Prevention and Control Training Program (BCPT), a 20-year collaboration
between the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, provides
interdisciplinary research training to pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to prepare them to be the next
generation of leaders in cancer control research. The objectives of the program for the next 5 years are to: 1)
recruit excellent and diverse pre-doctoral and post-doctoral applicants from social and behavioral science-
based disciplines, as well as PhD or MD-trained basic or clinician scientists who wish to add a social and
behavioral sciences perspective to their cancer research; 2) provide trainees with an exceptional
interdisciplinary training experience that includes expert mentorship, research experience in active cancer
prevention and control projects, and leadership opportunities within those projects and within the trainee
community; and 3) skill development in grant writing, preparing scientific manuscripts and oral presentations
for conferences, and career planning. We propose to support two pre-doctoral and four post-doctoral trainees
each year; ideally each trainee would be supported for two years and we would support at least 18 trainees
over the 5-year period. We will also maintain our affiliate program to extend BCPT training and mentoring
opportunities to other trainees funded from different sources.
 The unique collaboration between the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center provides a rich array of qualified mentors, formal coursework, and cancer research projects
trainees engage with. We engaged faculty from multiple academic settings to train and support BCPT trainees;
these faculty will be a major presence in the next five years of training. Formal coursework at the University of
Washington is provided within the School of Public Health Departments of Health Systems and Population
Health, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics, the School's interdisciplinary programs in Public Health Genetics and
Public Health Nutrition, the School of Pharmacy, as well as within the School of Nursing for appropriate
candidates. Doctoral programs are offered in all these departments. Trainees will complete research
experience with their mentors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, and
the University of Washington. Over the life of BCPT, we have appointed 34 predoctoral fellows, 19 postdoctoral
fellows, and have provided support to 20 affiliated fellows (who were not funded through BCPT). The vast
majority of our trainees have completed BCPT and gone on to research careers in cancer control. The BCPT
provides trainees the knowledge, skills, and professional experiences they require to transition to successful
careers in cancer prevention and control."

U.S. maternal mortality rates have risen by 63.7% since 2019, making the U.S. the most dangerous developed
nation to give birth in. A major contributor is that many women are becoming pregnant with chronic health
conditions like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Underserved and minority women are particularly
vulnerable to chronic health conditions (e.g. black women are 2.3 times more likely to be overweight compared
to white women) and poor pregnancy outcomes (e.g. black women are 2.6 times more likely to suffer a
pregnancy-related death than white women). These populations also have limited access to prenatal care (6.9
million women of childbearing age have little or no access to maternal health care). Fortunately, physical
activity during and after pregnancy improves maternal and infant outcomes. Professionals recommend all
pregnant women exercise for 150 minutes per week. However, less than 15% of pregnant women meet these
guidelines because they lack time and resources, fear they will harm the unborn baby, or have pregnancy-
related symptoms (e.g. fatigue, nausea, discomfort). There remains a significant, unmet need to develop
effective intervention strategies to reduce obesity rates and increase physical activity in pregnant and
postpartum women. To address this need, BumptUp Labs, Inc. created BumptUp®, the first mobile health app
to provide pregnant and postpartum women with careful screening and evidence-based, safe exercise
programming. Strong preliminary data support the app’s potential for impact, but more work is needed to test
the app’s efficacy for improving key health outcomes. The objective of this project is to conduct a clinical trial to
demonstrate BumptUp®’s efficacy, while also utilizing real-time customer feedback to enhance the app’s
experience and features. BumptUp® seeks to enter the market of mHealth apps through business-to-
consumer and business-to-business sales. During Phase I, the following aims will be completed: Aim 1—
Conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of BumtpUp® for increasing physical
activity levels during pregnancy (13-15, 23-25, and 35-37 weeks gestation) and postpartum (6 and 12 weeks).
Aim 2—Perform design changes to BumptUp® in response to results from the completed clinical trial to
improve usability and algorithm performance. These goals support the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development’s mission to improve reproductive health. At the end of Phase I, BumptUp Labs will have
clinical trial data to demonstrate its efficacy and a refined app that is prepped for success in commercial market
spaces. During Phase II, a new app feature—a mobile maternal and fetal heart rate monitor—will be
engineered and synced with the app to provide additional reassurance to mothers during exercise. We will also
make additional app adaptations to meet the specific needs of underserved subgroups (black, low
socioeconomic status, rural). Overall, the development of BumptUp® is expected to improve maternal health
outcomes while lowering healthcare costs for consumers and insurance companies."

Minnesota HealthSolutions Corporation (MHS) in collaboration with Mayo Clinic (Mayo) proposes to develop a
Parent Health Promoter digital platform to prompt and support positive behavior change for rural families. The
development of the proposed platform is particularly needed for rural populations who have higher rates of
obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and rural residents are more likely to be physically inactive compared to
their urban counterparts. Health promoting behaviors have a significant impact on many health outcomes,
including overweight and obesity in childhood and other non-communicable diseases. Yet rural populations
have less access to direct health care resources. Together, MHS and the Mayo will utilize iterative feedback
from the intended user population, to develop a platform based on both theory and practice that utilizes best
practices in user interface development. The needs of the intended population will be considered throughout
the development process and in phase I, a prototype of the platform will be tested with the intended population
for usability and acceptability. We have assembled a team with complimentary expertise to develop the
content, user interface and platform, and to conduct the needed testing."
10923895,"Arsenicals such as lewisite, diethylchloroarsine, diphenylchlorarsine, and diphenylcyanoarsine are extremely
toxic chemicals that have been used in chemical warfare since World War I and continue to remain a threat to
humans, who may be exposed through accidental or intentional mass population exposure. Topical exposure
to these agents results in severe cutaneous blistering, inflammation and pain, and therapeutic strategies that
safely and effectively attenuate this damage remain urgently needed. Such a strategy has long remained
elusive in large part because the molecular mechanisms that underlie the cutaneous damage caused by
arsenicals had not been identified. With our previous award, we developed murine and porcine models that,
upon topical arsenical exposure, develop cutaneous lesions nearly identical to those that occur in humans.
Employing these animal models, we identified a master regulatory signaling cascade underpinning the complex
pathobiology of arsenicals. Mechanistically, the inflammatory responses, cell death, tissue disruption, and pain
pathways induced by cutaneous arsenicals exposure are mediated by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress and reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent activation of unfolded protein response
(UPR) signaling, particularly that involving the ATF4-eIF2α axis. Phosphorylated eIF2α, which we found to be
upregulated after arsenicals exposure, blocks translation of most nascent proteins but upregulates the
translation of the ATF4 transcription factor. RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq data confirmed an unbiased role of ATF4
in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions and identified a unified role of ATF4-regulated proteins in this injury.
Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA),
which has been shown to enhance protein folding and reduce ER stress; the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC); and the inhibitor of eIF2α phosphorylation ISRIB. Each of these drugs was highly effective in restoring
protein translation and diminishing inflammation, tissue disruption, and pain in our mouse model. Thus, we
have validated the mechanism-based efficacy of these small molecule agents against cutaneous toxicity
induced by arsenicals. 4-BPA and NAC are FDA approved, thus we propose to advance these findings through
the lead optimization of 4-PBA and NAC delivered by topical administration after arsenicals exposure in our
murine and porcine models. Specifically, we propose to determine the efficacy of the maximum tolerated dose,
the window of efficacy, and the durability of response for these drugs, alone and in combination, in treating
arsenicals-mediated cutaneous injury in mice (Aim 1); to develop various topical formulations of these drugs
and assess the efficacy thereof against arsenicals-mediated cutaneous injury in mice (Aim 2); and to confirm
the efficacy of the identified novel outstanding formulation in our porcine model of arsenicals-mediated

10927288,"Project Summary / Abstract
Purpose: The Rhythm Evaluation for AntiCoagulaTion with Continuous Monitoring of Atrial Fibrillation (REACT
AF) clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment strategies for stroke prevention in atrial
fibrillation (AF): the current standard of continuous direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) versus a novel strategy of
precision, time-delimited DOAC initiated only in response to a ≥ 1-hour AF episode detected by an AF-sensing
smartwatch (AFSW (Apple Watch)).
Rationale: Stroke risk is often temporally related to AF onset and duration, but bleeding risk continues as a
constant risk of anticoagulation exposure even during long AF-free periods when stroke risk may be low. REACT-
AF will evaluate the benefits and risks of withholding anticoagulation during prolonged periods of sinus rhythm
as guided by an AFSW. Compared with continuous DOAC, AFSW-guided, time-delimited DOAC treatment may
reduce bleeding events while maintaining stroke protection. This has potential to improve important major clinical
outcomes and quality of life while reducing health care utilization.
Design: REACT-AF is a multicenter prospective, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE design) trial
comparing the current standard of care of continuous DOAC administration versus time-delimited DOAC
treatment guided by an AFSW in patients with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF and low-to-moderate
stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 1-4). The study will have an initial explanatory phase I followed by an
explanatory phase II with pragmatic elements.
Primary Aim 1 (Efficacy Objective): To assess whether AFSW-guided, time-delimited DOAC therapy is non-
inferior to continuous DOAC therapy for a composite endpoint that includes: (1) Ischemic Stroke; (2) Systemic
embolism; (3) All-cause mortality.
Hypothesis: Time-delimited DOAC therapy is non-inferior to continuous DOAC therapy for the composite
endpoint of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality.
Primary Aim 2 (Safety Objective): To assess whether AFSW-guided, time-delimited DOAC therapy significantly
reduces major bleeding events compared to continuous DOAC therapy.
Hypothesis: Major bleeding events will be significantly lower in participants randomized to AFSW-guided, time-
delimited DOAC therapy compared with participants receiving continuous DOAC therapy.
Exploratory Aim 1: To compare overall participant satisfaction with anticoagulation management between the
two study arms.
Exploratory Aim 2: To compare estimates of health-related resource utilization in participants randomized to
control versus experimental arms."

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus spread by mosquitos that causes persistent arthritis in
approximately 25% of people two years after initial infection. There is currently no standard evidence-based
treatment for CHIKV chronic arthritis. The French guidelines suggest the use of methotrexate in the treatment
of chronic CHIKV arthritis however there are no randomized placebo-controlled trials of methotrexate to
support this recommendation. Our long-term goal is to guide the evidence-based treatment of CHIKV arthritis.
The main goal of this proposal is to determine the efficacy and histopathologic effects of 6 months of
methotrexate (n=100) versus placebo (n=50) on synovitis in chronic CHIKV arthritis in Colombia in a
randomized controlled trial. Our central hypothesis is that methotrexate will significantly decrease chronic
CHIKV arthritis disease severity compared to placebo and suppress leukocyte accumulation and inflammatory
cytokine expression in synovial tissue. This hypothesis will be evaluated in 2 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine the efficacy of oral methotrexate treatment versus placebo for 6 months in chronic CHIKV arthritis.
In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of methotrexate on synovial inflammation by obtaining synovial biopsy
samples before and during treatment. Rationale: This work will define the role and mechanism of
methotrexate in the treatment of chronic CHIKV arthritis with the goal of advancing the field towards an
evidence-based standard treatment. The potential broader impact of this work is the potential identification of
the pathologic mechanism of chronic viral arthritis and a possible therapeutic option."

People living with HIV infection have increased risk of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, obesity
and diabetes mellitus, despite effective antiretroviral therapy. Emerging evidence show that residual persistent
immune dysregulation contributes to comorbidities in the HIV population. Cardiovascular disease and
metabolic disorders are important comorbidities affecting people aging with HIV. The NIH K24 Midcareer
Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research would provide crucial support to enable advancement of my
patient-oriented research into mechanisms and potential prevention and treatment strategies for
atherosclerosis and metabolic diseases including obesity, abnormal adipose tissue, insulin resistance and
diabetes mellitus in people with HIV. I currently lead multidisciplinary teams and our interdisciplinary studies
with rich collaborations with HIV virologists, immunologists, infectious disease clinical trialists, cardiologists,
gastroenterologists, pathologists, and biostatisticians provide an exciting research platform for mentoring.
Importantly, the support of the K24 Award would allow me to have dedicated and protected time to mentor new
physician scientists in clinical investigation. This award would also allow me to develop my own skills in
mentoring, leadership and research, and to advance scientific research on comorbidities in people with HIV,
especially metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities related to chronic immune inactivation in people living
with chronic HIV. Mentoring training will be provided utilizing my NIH funded studies to provide trainees with
opportunities to 1) investigate gastrointestinal mucosal barrier in people with HIV and its role in chronic
inflammation, immune activation and cardiovascular disease risk using existing data and intestinal biopsy
samples already collected and 2) to prospectively investigate the effects of CCR2 and CCR5 chemokine
receptor antagonism on immune activation, cardiovascular disease risk and metabolism in a multicenter
placebo-controlled, double-blind, 24-week long, randomized trial of cenicriviroc vs. placebo in adult men and
women living with HIV with suppressed HIV-1 RNA on stable ART who have increased CVD risk. This study
will leverage the clinical trial infrastructure of the ACTG and the extensive scientific expertise of collaborating
investigators and laboratories within the ACTG and provide rich training experiences for my mentees in patient

10924793,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), surgical connections of autogenous arteries and veins, are considered the gold
standard for hemodialysis (HD), the primary mode of survival for half a million Americans with failed kidneys
(progressive chronic kidney disease, CKD) and millions more globally. However, 39% of the AVFs created in the
United States fail to ever be used for dialysis, and 50% are abandoned within 12 months, greatly contributing to
1- and 5-year HD mortality rates of 21% and 60%, respectively. The reason for such high AVF failure rates is
that veins are thinner-walled and far more compliant than arteries, not equipped for the high pressure, high flow,
pulsatile environment of the arterial circulation. Veins drastically expand as a result, causing injury to the
protective inner endothelial lining of the vessel that leads to migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs), or neointimal hyperplasia (NH), causing occlusion, lack of blood flow, and loss of patency. This
problem of veins failing to successfully adapt or arterialize from surgeries connecting veins to arteries is termed
the ‘Achilles heel’ of vascular surgery because the problem is so pervasive and incorrigible, greatly impacting
morbidity and mortality for over 5 million new patients each year undergoing AVF creation, arteriovenous graft
(AVG) creation, peripheral artery bypass grafting (PABG), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.
To address this underlying physiological problem, VenoStent has developed the SelfWrap Bioabsorbable
Perivascular Wrap (i.e. SelfWrap), a wrap that goes around the vein at the time of the vein-to-artery connection
surgery to provide optimal mechanical support and help it successfully arterialize, with a first indication for AVFs.
SelfWrap is comprised of finely-tuned, bioabsorbable, thermo-responsive smart polymers and its geometric
features are optimally configured to help the vein adapt favorably to the arterial circulation.
The net result of this device impact has been a significant reduction in NH in three different chronic large animal
models: a diseased rabbit bypass grafting model at 90 days (funded by the NIH STTR Phase I Award), ovine
AVFs at 90,180, and 365 days (funded by NSF SBIR Phase II), and in ovine AVGs at 60 days. Most importantly,
the clinical benefit of the SelfWrap device has been demonstrated in a 20-patient Initial Feasibility Study, where
very high maturation rates, low intervention rates, high catheter removal rates, and high patency were achieved.
These clinical and preclinical results awarded VenoStent Breakthrough Device Designation from FDA in 2022.
This proposal evaluates the safety and effectiveness of SelfWrap in CKD patients referred for creation of a new
AVF in a pivotal study. Successful completion of this pivotal trial, with a significant improvement in the primary
outcome and no significant safety concerns using SelfWrap, would provide the evidence needed for FDA
approval of this Breakthrough Device. This could potentially revolutionize the field of vascular surgery, improving
the quality and length of life for millions of patients each year that undergo AVF, AVG, PABG, or CABG surgery."
10924895,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
“Killer” (“cytotoxic”) T cells are the cells of the immune system that have the job of killing
cancerous and virus-infected cells. But they do so only if they have receptors capable of
recognizing antigens – expressed on the surface of target cells – that are specific to the cancer or
virus involved. And often it is the absence or shortage of these antigen-specific receptors that is
responsible for a patient not surviving the growth and metastasis of a cancer or the spread of a
viral infection. Accordingly, immunotherapies have been developed that involve: extracting T
cells from a patient; transforming them so that they express the desired receptors; “expanding”
(“growing up”) the cells; and, finally, putting them back into the patient so that they can lower
the load of cancerous or virus-infected tissue. Aside from the cost and danger of extraction and
infusion of immune cells, this ex vivo procedure – the current state-of-the-art of immunotherapy
– introduces serious risk of oncogenesis because the T-cell transformation involves the (poorly-
controlled) integration of receptor genes into the T-cell chromosomes.
What we are proposing is a totally different approach that avoids the risks of both the
extraction/infusion and of the chromosomal transformation. More explicitly, our aim is to
transform T cells in vivo, by delivering the receptor genes directly to the T cells in the blood and
lymph system of the patient; further, the genes are in mRNA form so that their expression is
transient, involving no change in chromosomal DNA; finally, the mRNA is protected and targeted
by being self-assembled in vitro with purified viral capsid protein, so that its shell is functionalized
with an antibody against proteins uniquely expressed in T cells.
Our methodology involves the complementary expertises of the two PIs. Dr.Gelbart’s lab has
worked for the past 15 years on the in vitro packaging of mRNA into virus-like particles (VLPs)
using the capsid protein of a plant virus that is capable of self-assembling around arbitrary-
sequence RNA, and on the functionalization of these particles with targeting antibodies and other
protein ligands. Dr. Yang’s lab has worked for the past 25 years on the basic biology of HIV
infections and specifically on the ex vivo transformation of T cells with T-cell receptors (TCRs)
and/or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that are specific against HIV or cancer antigens and on
quantifying the cell-killing activity of these transformed T cells. Together we will be developing
an In vivo T-cell therapy along the lines outlined above and demonstrating its efficacy in a mouse
model of HIV."

Recent HIV outbreaks among rural people who inject drugs (PWID) highlighted significant gaps in HIV prevention
science. HIV risk behaviors among PWID are influenced by several factors, including access to sterile injection
equipment and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), law enforcement practices, and utilization of medications for
opioid use disorder (MOUD) and harm reduction (e.g., accessing syringe services programs [SSPs]). None of
the existing HIV prevention literature has examined the relationships between complex patterns of interactions
and engagements among a triad of HIV risk modifiers (MOUD, harm reduction, and law enforcement), high-risk
behaviors, and HIV incidence among rural PWID during periods of peak HIV transmission. Social network
characteristics are another driver of HIV transmission as PWID networks may be characterized as having specific
norms surrounding injection practices and risk reduction strategies. Studying how combinations of factors known
to influence HIV risks interact at the individual- and network-levels among PWID in rural communities with HIV
outbreaks presents a unique opportunity to inform the design of interventions that can respond to rapidly evolving
HIV prevention needs and barriers. Evidence generated from urban studies documents that network-oriented
interventions focused on social influence processes are able to shift norms related to high-risk sexual behaviors
and injection practices and use of risk reduction strategies, leading to reductions in HIV risk behaviors and HIV
transmission. However, there is limited literature describing how to adapt network-oriented HIV prevention
interventions for rural PWID. To address these gaps, our study aims: 1. To examine longitudinal changes in the
associations between the frequency and types of engagements with a triad of HIV risk modifiers (i.e., MOUD,
harm reduction, and law enforcement), HIV risk behaviors, and HIV incidence among a cohort of rural PWID
(N=400) during a HIV outbreak over 18 months; 2.To examine how the associations between egocentric network
characteristics (e.g., perceived norms, turnover, density) and utilization of three evidence-based approaches to
HIV risk reduction (MOUD, PrEP, and SSPs) change over 18 months among a cohort of rural PWID during a
HIV outbreak; 3. To engage rural PWID in the adaptation and pilot testing of a network-oriented intervention to
reduce high-risk injection practices and sexual behaviors; and 3A. To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of the adapted intervention among rural PWID (N=60) to assess acceptability and feasibility. The proposed
research is directly responsive to the 2022-2026 NIDA Strategic Plan. Aims 1 and 2 map directly to Goal 2.2,
“Accelerate the science of harm reduction.” Additionally, this study aligns with Priority Scientific Area #3:
Accelerate Research on the Intersection of Substance Use and HIV in that our rural study setting is experiencing
a HIV outbreak driven in part by social norms surrounding high-risk behaviors and stimulant use. The results of
this study will shift paradigms in how we understand HIV prevention in rural contexts."

HIV remains the most pressing public health issue for Latino/x sexual minority men (SMM) in the U.S. Although
Latino/x SMM comprise a small percentage of the U.S. population, they make up a majority of new HIV
infections. To effectively address minority health disparities, research should target overlooked Latino/x SMM
migrant subgroups, the largest segment of foreign-born sexual minorities in the U.S. who tend to move for
better economic opportunities and to escape victimization. Although research consistently shows that SMM
migrants experience alarmingly high rates of HIV infection following migration, studies have yet to examine
how social ecological factors magnify this risk among Latino/x SMM migrants. Guided by the NIMHD research
framework and employing a mixed-methods sequential exploratory study design, the proposed study will
advance science by providing rich description of social ecological and social integration factors associated with
sexual risk, HIV testing, and PrEP use among Latino/x SMM migrants. Therefore, the aims of the proposed
study are to: (1A) identify the social ecological (structural, community, interpersonal, individual) factors
associated with sexual risk, HIV testing, and PrEP use among Latino/x SMM migrants living in the mainland
U.S., (1B) empirically derive, using latent class analysis, subgroups of Latino/x SMM migrants living in the U.S.
based on social integration indicators (immigration status, length of time in the U.S., language use, social
connections, healthcare access and utilization), and examine their moderating role in the association between
social ecological factors and sexual risk, HIV testing, and PrEP use, and subsequently (2) examine, using in-
depth qualitative interviews, sexual risk, HIV testing, and PrEP decision-making processes involved in,
including facilitators of and barriers to, PrEP use among Latino/x SMM migrants living in the U.S. To achieve
Aims 1A and 1B, an online survey will be used to collect and analyze data and investigate the role of
integration in the association between social ecological factors and sexual risk, HIV testing, and PrEP by
empirically deriving, using latent class analysis, subgroups of Latino/x SMM migrants based on their integration
experiences. This phase (Phase 1) of the study will include 300 Latino/x SMM migrants recruited online via
geo-location dating apps. To achieve Aim 2, we will administer in-depth qualitative interviews to examine how
sexual risk, HIV testing, and PrEP decision-making processes, including facilitators and barriers, shape PrEP
use among Latino/x SMM migrants. This phase (Phase 2) of the study a total of 30 Latino/x SMM migrants,
recruited among those who completed Phase 1. At least 5 of the 30 will be on PrEP. The proposed study will
further establish the empirical foundation for future research with this exceptionally vulnerable subgroup of
Latino/x, SMM, and migrant populations; that is, protocol development for and pilot testing of a multi-level
intervention designed to promote PrEP use among Latino/x SMM migrants."
10923493,"Project Summary
In 2014, the immigrant population in the United States (US) was 42 million and is projected to reach 78 million
by 2060, a growth of 85%; an estimated 3% of immigrants identify as sexual and gender minorities. Evidence
shows that sexual minority men (SMM) may be particularly likely to immigrate, whether by choice or force, in
search of social and sexual freedoms that are not available in their home countries. Among the general SMM
population, stigma at the individual, interpersonal, and structural levels, and subsequent minority stress reactions
(e.g., internalized stigma, identity concealment, expectations of and actual discrimination experiences) contribute
to co-occurring HIV and mental health risks. Sexual minority stressors negatively influence SMM’s sexual and
mental health, in particular SMM of color. The experiences of Arab immigrant SMM may be different from other
groups, in particular because of their exposure to high structural stigma and potentially lethal homophobia, high
risk to HIV, and poor mental health in their home countries, which then intersects with their current US context
of strong anti-Arab and anti-immigration rhetoric that has intensified in the past 2 decades. Despite this
confluence of risks, there are no interventions that address the magnitude of intersectional stigma on HIV risk
and mental health among Arab immigrant SMM. Theoretically informed interventions can buffer against the
health risks of stigma when tailored to address minority stress reactions among SMM; however, most
interventions do not account for multiple and intersecting sources of stigma, and none focus on immigration-
related stigma, especially as it is experienced by Arab immigrant SMM. Our intervention, ESTEEM (Effective
Skills to Empower Effective Men), a minority stress focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown
strong efficacy in improving mental, behavioral, and HIV (e.g., condom use and pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP])
health outcomes among SMM. Our preliminary interviews with Arab immigrant SMM (N=16) suggest intervention
preferences for an online group delivery format that connects SMM with shared experiences, irrespective of their
current geographical location, thus facilitating greater reach and effective recruitment, to be led by trained
counselors that share similar identities (Arab, immigrant, and/or sexual minority). Following the ADAPT-ITT
model, this study aims to adapt and pilot-test the ESTEEM intervention to target the underlying mechanisms
linking first-generation (i.e. foreign-born) Arab immigrant SMM’s intersectional minority stressors to co-occurring
HIV risks and poor mental health outcomes. In Aim 1, we will seek input from multiple stakeholders using
qualitative interviews with 15 mental health experts and 15 Arab immigrant SMM, and adapt ESTEEM for online
group delivery and for Arab immigrant SMM in the US. In Aim 2, we will randomize 60 participants to receive 10
weekly, 90-minute online-based group sessions, either immediately (immediate intervention group, n=30) or after
3 months (waitlist control group, n=30) to evaluate intervention acceptability and feasibility and to determine
preliminary efficacy on primary (HIV-risk behavior) and secondary (mental health) outcomes."

Socioeconomic and racial disparities in cancer care and outcomes among older adults have been persisted
and even widened in recent years. At the same time, the lack of safe and affordable housing has become a
national crisis. Despite the strong potential for housing insecurity to impact cancer inequities, there is a paucity
of evidence connecting these two areas. The Housing assistance, Outcomes, MEdicare, and SEER
(HOMES) Study is a highly innovative investigation of the association between housing insecurity and cancer
inequities. It focuses on the role of federal housing assistance which, through a variety of programs, including
Housing Choice Vouchers, public housing, and multifamily housing, limit household spending on rent and
utilities. By increasing housing affordability and stability, improving housing quality, changing neighborhood
context, and connecting residents with health and social services, federal housing assistance has the potential
to improve the quality of care that patients with cancer receive and, more broadly, shed light on the intersection
of cancer and housing. The study focuses on older adults diagnosed with breast, colorectal, prostate, and non-
small cell lung cancers given their high incidence and well-documented inequities. The study makes use of a
novel dataset being constructed by the National Cancer Institute that merges linked SEER-Medicare data on
patients diagnosed (2006-2019) with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data on the receipt
of federal housing assistance. Because individuals who receive housing assistance may be fundamentally
different from those who do not, the study makes use of an innovative pseudo-waitlist control design that
leverages the limited supply of housing assistance relative to demand and the random timing of the receipt of
housing assistance. The first aim examines the overall relationship between receipt of federal housing
assistance and cancer care (time to treatment, receipt of guideline concordant care, emergency department
visits) and outcomes (stage at diagnosis). The second aim investigates whether these relationships vary by
cancer site and, given experiences of systemic racism that intersect with cancer disparities and housing policy,
by race/ethnicity. The final aim studies whether the association between housing assistance and cancer care
and outcomes varies by the form of housing assistance and across different neighborhood contexts. Informed
by a policy advisory committee in conjunction with representatives from the American Cancer Society Cancer
Action Network and National Cancer Roundtables, the HOMES Study has the strong potential to provide
actionable housing and cancer policy recommendations and inform changes to practice designed to improve
cancer equity."

imaging evaluates for blood flowing around the stent into the aorta, called an “endoleak”. While most
endoleaks are harmless, 1-3% are high-pressure “Type I” endoleaks, which lead to rupture and require repair.
However, a point may be reached where continued annual surveillance imaging may not be the best choice for
elderly Veterans after EVAR. Imaging-associated risks include acute kidney injury from contrast dye used
during the CT scan (3-10%), the identification of harmless endoleaks which require no treatment (10-20%), and
incidental findings such as lung or kidney nodules which trigger further invasive testing or treatment (10-15%).
Our scientific rationale in this project centers on better understanding a key gap in knowledge: the tradeoffs
between imaging-associated risks and the chance of identifying a dangerous form of endoleak (1-3%) can be
difficult, especially for aging Veterans with multiple co-morbidities.
Significance: This evidence gap surrounding when to stop surveillance is especially important for Veterans,
who are more frail, elderly, and rural than non-Veteran EVAR populations. We estimate that more than 10,000
Veterans are currently alive with an EVAR in place. This suggests that more than 10,000 scans will be
performed each year based on our preliminary cohort assembly, and more than 500 Veterans will have
complications such as nephrotoxicity. Because it affects a chronic condition among our oldest Veterans, our
study is aligned with the HRD&D Topic Category “Management of Chronic Conditions” and the HSR&D
Specific Priority Area “Long-term Care and Aging”.
Innovation and Impact: There is an absence of guidelines to help Veterans and their clinicians decide when
surveillance imaging should occur, and when its utility may be limited. Developing and disseminating this
evidence would bring an innovative approach towards limiting unnecessary testing and harms among elderly
Veterans.
Specific Aims: We propose a mixed-methods study with two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will qualitatively assess
Veteran, family, and health care team members’ attitudes and beliefs surrounding surveillance imaging after
EVAR. Aim 2 will quantitatively characterize observational data sources to understand surveillance imaging
outcomes after EVAR. Our Dissemination Plan will integrate these findings to create evidence for when
surveillance imaging should continue, and when it may have limited utility. We hypothesize that imaging
associated risks may outweigh the benefits of ongoing surveillance in older Veterans with significant
comorbidities.
Methodology: Our study design leverages a parallel approach: qualitative assessment of stakeholder beliefs
about cessation of imaging surveillance (Aim 1) and quantitative analysis of retrospective clinical data to
evaluate the use, outcomes, and risks of imaging surveillance (Aim 2).
Next Steps/Implementation: Our project involves leaders from organizations such as the VA’s national VA
Surgery Advisory Board, the Society for Vascular Surgery, a nationally recognized web-based forum for
geriatric care, and other organizations to ensure effective dissemination of our evidence. The evidence
generated in our proposal will be shared using innovative pathways, such as podcasts, to ensure our project’s
deliverables and impact are sustained."

The CNPRC has maintained a pedigreed colony of Indian-origin rhesus macaques for over 20 years. The SPF
Pedigreed Indian origin rhesus colony includes both an SPF level 1 colony negative for Simian Retrovirus
(SRV), Simian Immmunodeficiency Virus (SIV) and Simian T Cell Lymphotropic Virus (STLV), Herpes B virus
(B virus) and an SPF level 2 colony free of three additional viruses including include rhesus cytomegalovirus
(RhCMV), simian foamy virus (SFV), and rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV). All colony animals have had MHC typing
for Mamu-A*01, Mamu-A*08, and Mamu-B*01, and the colony is managed to optimize genetic diversity. This
proposal will expand the characterization of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) to include Class I
(Mamu-A and -B) and Class II (Mamu-DRB, -DQA, -DQB, -DPA, and -DPB) loci. To genotype these markers,
the U42 Genetic Typing Core will submit samples from our adult SPF rhesus macaques to the Genetics
Services Unit at the WNPRC. The application proposes to. The four principal goals of this application are:
Continue to expand the SPF Level 2 population relative to Level 1 while maintaining overall colony size.
Develop improved and expanded screening and confirmatory tests for detecting SPF agents to facilitate the
maintenance of the SPF colony. We will initiate annual surveillance for Trypanosoma cruzi in recognition of the
expansion of the geographic range of this parasitic infection. This work includes new assays for agents such as
tuberculosis, representing the first SPF agent.
Maintain genetic analysis to determine the pedigree of Indian rhesus macaques born into the colony and test
all adult breeders to characterize their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I (Mamu-A and -B) and
Class II (Mamu-DRB, -DQA, -DQB, -DPA, and -DPB) loci.
Continue collecting and storing intestinal microbiome and peripheral blood lymphocyte samples in a unique
SPF Level 2 biorepository to facilitate future research projects investigating the interaction of HIV with the host
microbiome and immune system."

Biofilm is a major contributor to clinical antibiotic resistance, as biofilm-associated (sessile) bacteria show
up to 1000-fold lower sensitivity to antibiotics than free growing (planktonic) forms. The CDC estimates
that 70% of clinically significant antibiotic failure is due to biofilm, including infections associated with
implants, catheters, and tissue adhesions. TRL1068 is a native human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is
highly effective for disrupting biofilm and thereby enhancing the bactericidal activity of conventional
antibiotics. The antibody target is conserved across both Gram positive and negative bacteria species. With
prior SBIR funding, we demonstrated efficacy in five rodent models. With CARB-X funding, we initiated clinical
development for patients with a prosthetic joint infection (PJI): TRL1068-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT04763759). Standard of care for such patients includes replacement of the infected implant with an
antibiotic eluting spacer for 8 weeks followed by a second surgery to implant a fresh prosthesis. A planned
interim analysis demonstrated positive safety data, and established that the antibody penetrates into the
synovial space. The bacterial burden on the explanted prosthesis was quantified following a standardized
sonication method from the Mayo Clinic in a standardized volume of Ringer solution. After 7 days of
treatment with TRL1068, 6 of 8 patients (75%) had a bacterial biofilm burden below 100 CFU/mL sonication
fluid, and for 2 of them the adherent bacteria were below the limit of detection. The reduction and removal of
biofilm in these eight PJI patients compares favorably to historical data (n=60) for which implants from only
15% of PJI patients were below 100 CFU/mL sonication fluid. In one of the animal models above, TRL1068 was
administered directly to the respiratory system and was shown to be effective for bacterial pneumonia. Here,
we propose to conduct a Phase 1 safety trial in healthy adult volunteers for TRL1068 formulated for
nebulized delivery as an inhaled therapeutic to treat bronchial infections. We have previously developed an
inhaled formulation for our influenza therapeutic mAb program (near-IND). Direct administration of TRL1068
to the airways should provide superior efficacy at a substantially reduced dose."

 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), one of the premier academic medical
centers in the world, requests continued support for a graduate and post-graduate Molecular Microbiology
Training Program (MMTP) that has existed for 25 years. This MMTP supports five predoctoral students and
two postdoctoral fellows for two-year training periods each. A particularly attractive feature of this highly
successful training program has been its departure from conventional ""program-"" or ""departmental-based""
training to an interdisciplinary program that maintains a strong microbiology orientation while, at the same time,
broadens the scope of the training mission to include many other aspects of molecular and cell biology. The
highly diverse backgrounds of the 31 trainers, comprised of a core group of highly accomplished established
investigators and an expanding, impressive new faculty, embody interdisciplinary research programs bound by
the common theme of molecular and cellular microbiology. The training faculty are from nine different
departments (Microbiology, Immunology, Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Pharmacology, Biochemistry,
Internal Medicine, Dermatology, and Pediatrics). The MMTP serves as a primary focus for formal interactions
among this overlapping group of talented trainers who have strong records of accomplishment in research and
training. Our goal is to train students and fellows for research careers in the general areas of the molecular
basis of microbial pathogenesis, cellular microbiology, host defense mechanisms, regulation of virulence
expression, pathogen adaptation, drug development, structural biology, and many other related areas. The
research interests of the majority of the faculty include bacterial and viral pathogenesis, innate and adaptive
immune mechanisms, antimicrobial drug design, RNA metabolism, bacterial secretion systems, microbial
physiology, viral evolution, and structural biology (as it pertains to microbial pathogenesis). There is a strong
emphasis on molecular mechanisms, molecular biology, and the application of the most contemporary
methods in molecular technologies, all of which provide the thread that unites and integrates the diverse
research areas. Trainees who complete this program are expected to be able to apply state-of-the-art
molecular approaches towards important problems in the microbiological sciences and for the improvement of
preventive and/or therapeutic intervention strategies for infectious diseases. There is solid evidence of major
successes for this training program over the past funding interval."

The Administration, Biostatistics and Clinical Database Core provides support for all three projects within
the P01. The PI, Dr. Ferrara, is responsible for the overall conduct of this research program. An executive
committee of members (the three project and core leaders) is chaired by the PI. The executive committee
meets formally on a monthly basis to review progress of the individual projects, to monitor the function of
the cores, and to resolve any potential logistical difficulties. Umut Özbek, Ph.D., provides biostatistical
oversight to all projects with expertise in three categories of statistical services: 1) statistical analysis of
clinical and biomarker data; 2) experimental design, sample size calculations and analyses in
experimental models; and 3) clinical trial design and monitoring. Dr. Levine oversees the activities of the
data coordinating center which provides a number of innovative and cost effective services. The MAGIC
database currently contains data for 5,000 HCT recipients and 2300 acute GVHD cases; ~700 patients
(300 with GVHD) per year. This core has developed rigorous processes to minimize data errors both
before and after data entry.
The Core 1 objectives are as follows:
1. To provide administrative and fiscal oversight to all projects and cores, and to facilitate optimal
 interactions including centralized data sharing, document generation, organization monitoring,
 financial reports, and accountability to all internal and external agencies.
2. To provide advanced biostatistical support for analysis of clinical and laboratory data and assist in
 the biostatistical design of experiments in all projects.
3. To oversee the creation and curation of the MAGIC database."
10920530,"Project Summary
Our overarching goal in this project is the development and evaluation of a stand-alone breast cancer image
device that facilitates more rapid, effective, and definitive cancer detection and diagnosis in dense breast
women. The device being developed is based upon our proprietary Narrow-Beam Computed Tomography
(CT) technology—an image acquisition architecture that fundamentally differs from existing CT designs.
The key advantage of this technology is its ability to deliver three-dimensional images in high spatial
resolution that are nearly free of contamination from scatter, at low levels of dose deemed safe for breast
cancer screening applications, without any breast compression. The system’s unique ability to yield high
quality, fully tomographic (3-dimensional) spectral data makes possible the delivery of detailed, time-
based, diagnostic information that may allow for effective identification of malignant cancers in all women,
but specifically in women with dense breast tissue. The specific aims of this project include developing a
time-based image reconstruction to further increase the temporal resolution of the system without extending
required scan time. Validation of the developed methodology is through a hybrid 4D anthropomorphic flow
phantom developed collaboratively with our partner laboratory. Another focus of this project is gaining
insight into the clinical viability of our solution through a first in patient retrospective pilot study. Upon
completion of this project’s aims, we will have a device for large-scale in-patient prospective studies."
10921274,"Project Summary
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered an excellent technology for quantifying muscle
composition in a variety of disorders. MRI offers superb insights into muscle condition and pathology, including
muscle size, the amount of fat deposition, and the presence of edema or inflammation. It is now often used as
a tool in clinical trials to provide biomarkers for assessing disease progression and response to therapeutic
intervention disorders ranging from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to atrophy related to aging or injury.
However, MRI has major drawbacks as a muscle characterization tool, including inconvenience, high cost, the
requirement for patients to lie flat (a major challenge in patients with impaired respiratory function), the need
to standardize across systems, and the necessity for cumbersome image processing. A technology that could
offer much of what of MRI has to offer but with greater convenience, lower cost, and simplified analysis could
find wide application both for clinical trials but also ultimately for individual patient care. One technology that
could achieve this is electrical impedance myography (EIM). EIM has independently been shown to correlate
strongly with muscle pathology and to track disease progression and response to therapy. Myolex, Inc has
made the development and application of EIM its focus. In this direct-to-Phase 2 SBIR application, Myolex
proposes to establish EIM, via its new device, the mScan, as a valuable alternative to MRI for
assessment of muscle condition in primary myopathic disorders. We propose to achieve this by
performing EIM and MRI on patients with a variety of myopathies, including autoimmune and hereditary
conditions, and using machine learning to develop predictive algorithms relating EIM to MRI. Our underlying
hypothesis is that EIM data closely relates to muscle pathology as revealed by MRI and the simpler,
more convenient technology of EIM can be trained to provide MRI-like assessments of muscle
condition. In Specific Aim 1, in conjunction with physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
Harvard Medical School, we will collect MRI and EIM data on a cohort of healthy subjects and patients with
primary myopathic conditions, including those with active muscle inflammation/ edema (secondary to myositis
and toxic myopathy) and more chronic conditions (including hereditary myopathies and muscular dystrophies)
of varying severity. Strength and functional data will also be collected. Using this data, in Specific Aim 2, we
will develop predictive algorithms, via the penalized regression technique of Lasso (least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator), leveraging EIM values to predict MRI findings. These findings will also be associated
with functional measures. Successful algorithms will be incorporated into a cloud-based diagnostic engine to
provide quantifiable data on muscle disease pathology. At the conclusion of this work, we will have developed
an accurate, quantitative EIM system for predicting the type and severity of muscle disease pathology across
a variety of conditions, helping to speed therapeutic drug development and to improve overall patient care."

We propose to further develop, refine, and validate our emerging free-solution assay (FSA) technology and our
relatively new compensated Interferometric reader (CIR).1,2 The development of FSA-CIR addresses a
significant void, a blind spot in cancer research because it represents the only label-free, solution-phase, ultra-
sensitive, enzyme-free, technology compatible with essentially any matrix. Unlike existing tools, FSA-CIR has
been shown to be useful for; a) mechanism of Action (MOA) studies on unadulterated/unmodified targets and
probes with no relative mass sensitivity, b) full-length membrane protein interaction studies in native matrix, c)
defining allosteric modulation and weak protein-protein interactions, d) accelerating quantitative assay
development, e) potentially addressing biomarker discovery/validation bottleneck, f) performing quantitative
interactions across the matrix spectrum on a single platform and g) enabling ex-vivo measurements to guide
first-in-human dose determinations (FIHD) (see Pfizer letter). FSA-CIR is a paradigm shifting technology based
on a novel molecular interaction transduction method with fluorescence-level sensitivity, and capabilities for
targeting, probing, and assessing molecular and cellular features of cancer biology, as well as improving early
detection and screening, clinical diagnosis. FSA is mix-and-read, agnostic to the molecular interaction pair and
compatible with complex matrices, making it uniquely applicable in both the basic and clinical cancer research
arenas. CIR represents a major advancement in interferometric sensing, due to an unprecedented level of
sample-reference compensation CIR is operated without external thermal control, a unique feature for a
refractive index (RI) sensor with <10-7 RIU sensitivity. The optical engine in CIR is unique, patented and quite
simple, consisting of a diode laser, capillary tube, mirror and detector. When combining the interferometer with
a droplet generator for sample introduction, CIR facilitates quantification of molecular interactions without relative
mass dependence, at picomolar sensitivity and allows good sample throughput (50 serum sample-reference
pairs run in quintuplet, [5 replicate droplet pairs], plus calibrations in a day. Feasibility of our assay methodology
is demonstrated for mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies, quantification of drug target engagement as needed in
theranostics and ultrasensitive, volume constrained, biomarker assay development, and target quantification.
Data indicate FSA-CIR has the potential for widespread applicability and adoption throughout the scientific
community and is mature enough to be an R-33 project. At project completion we aim to provide the scientific
and medical community with a user-friendly platform technology for biochemical mechanism of action studies, to
aid in improving cancer prognostics, and the ability to measure properties such as molecular and/or cellular
mechanisms important in cancer."
10916337,"HABS-HD OMICS CORE (CORE D) - ABSTRACT
Biofluids, including blood and CSF, alone or in combination, may provide sensitive biomarkers for Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) diagnosis, prognosis, and theragnosis. To date, however, no large-scale systematic multi-level
“omics” study has been conducted in combination with AT(N) defined (amyloid [A], tau [T], neurodegeneration
[N]) biomarkers among African Americans, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. Our data suggests
that (1) omics-based biomarkers vary across diverse populations, including plasma AT(N) biomarkers, (2)
omics-based biomarkers can be highly accurate in detecting clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and dementia across populations, but (3) the profiles differ between racial/ethnic groups. More recently,
our data suggests that a proteomic profile is accurate in detecting neurodegeneration, but again the profiles
vary between racial/ethnic groups. Given the documented differences in AT(N) biomarkers by racial/ethnic
groups, it is likely that multi-level omics investigations will highlight novel population-specific pathways for
cognitive decline, MCI and AD. Additionally, with the recent FDA approval of a disease modifying amyloid drug,
the data from the Omics Core (Core D) is more important than ever and can rapidly inform novel, appropriately
tailored, clinical trials. Core D will oversee the collection, processing, assays, storage and distribution of
samples to provide critical data to all Projects (Core – Project Interactions), Cores (Core-Core interactions),
and to global investigators (Cross-Cohort Interactions). Aim 1: Generate high quality genomic data. Aim 2:
Generate high quality proteomic data. Aim 3: Generate high quality exosome data. Aim 4: Generate high
quality metabolomic data. Aim 5: Provide critical omics data for projects (Core-Core, Core-Project

10918893,"ABSTRACT Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the US with almost 100,000 cases estimated for
2023. Late-stage disease has a five-year survival of just 30%, resulting in almost 8,000 deaths in the US alone.
When detected early, melanoma has a survival rate of 99%; however, a widely adopted screening tool for
melanoma currently does not exist. The current standard of care in skin cancer detection relies on a clinical
visual assessment of moles, followed by an invasive biopsy of suspicious lesions. The low accuracy of this
approach (84% sensitivity and 3-16% specificity) leads to missed melanomas and high rates of “unnecessary
biopsies”, biopsies of benign moles. An average of 25 biopsies are required for each melanoma found, resulting
in 3 million biopsies of benign moles each year. For this reason, the US Preventative Services Task Force does
not recommend routine visual screening for skin cancer in adults, citing the potential harm of the high rate of
unnecessary biopsies. Non-invasive genetic or spectroscopic tests that are currently available have either
sensitivities that are too low (below 98%) or specificities that are too low (below visual assessment). We
hypothesize that limited applicability of these approaches stems from the limited availability of melanoma
biomarkers. Studies have shown that a combination genetic markers and histological analysis offer an excellent
combination for specific and sensitive diagnosis; however, no minimally-invasive technology exists to provide
samples for this purpose. We propose a “laser microbiopsy” as a technique to harvest microliter-sized tissues,
using a ring-shaped infrared laser such that the center of the annulus can be removed with minimal damage by
a pulse of light. Because laser tissue removal is essentially instantaneous (within microseconds) and the biopsy
size is on the scale of hundreds of micrometers, the procedure is potentially much less harmful than traditional
punch biopsies. Importantly, our preliminary work shows that the laser microbiopsy penetrates through the
epidermis and to the melanocytes, where melanoma originates. To further develop this approach, we will refine
and characterize the performance of the laser microbiopsy hardware (Aim 1) and validate viability of extracted
micro-biopsies for molecular analysis (Aim 2). We envision our approach providing pain-free tissue for offline
pathology and molecular analysis of melanoma as well as a possible surgical guidance tool for real-time
assessment of tumor margins. In addition, harvested tissues could be used for primary tissue cultures or flow
cytometry. Once this proof-of-principle (R61) project is complete, we anticipate transitioning the laser
microbiopsy from a developmental phase to test feasibility for melanoma diagnosis in an R33 application."

In both neuroscience research and clinical practice, measurements predominantly focus either on neurochemical
or electrophysiological function within the nervous system. This bifurcated approach limits our comprehensive
understanding of the nervous system. Ideally, simultaneously recording both multichannel electrophysiological
and neurochemical biomarkers would provide a more complete view of neurological function, paving the way for
dynamic, multi-biomarker, closed-loop solutions. Such advancements would address a significant clinical need,
for the treatment and of study neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, depression, and drug abuse.
Over the last decade, Dr. Alexander Zestos has developed carbon-based microelectrodes to simultaneously
detect multiple neurotransmitters using Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). Additionally, he has integrated
this neurochemical sensing technology with electrophysiology techniques, offering a dual-function, multi-channel
probe. This represents a critical proof-of-concept, foundational for both advanced research tools and prospective
medical device development. Dr. Zestos' preliminary endeavors have yielded innovative carbon coating
processes for metal electrodes and carbon fiber multielectrode arrays, both utilized with multichannel
potentiostats for enhanced FSCV neurochemical measurements. His techniques have notably showcased the
simultaneous measurement of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and adenosine in both in vitro and ex
vivo settings. Moreover, these carbon-based approaches have demonstrated superior sensitivity compared to
traditional methods, presenting a promising direction for future applications.
In this two-year STTR, Dr. Zestos is partnering with Spike Neuro to combine his carbon coating techniques with
Spike Neuro’s electrophysiology Silicon microelectrodes (SiME) to create a dual-function neurochemistry and
electrophysiology microelectrode. This work will also explore recent promising developments with the use of
Silicon-Carbide microelectrodes (4H-SiCME) for both neurochemistry and electrophysiology function. 4H-
SiCMEs promise to offer a more robust and biocompatible material option compared to existing neurochemistry
and electrophysiology electrode materials. The project is structured around two primary aims.
Aim 1 will concentrate on refining the carbon deposition process for SiMEs, optimizing contact size, and
evaluating longevity and function.
Aim 2 efforts will pivot to the development of 4H-SiCMEs, addressing inherent production limitations, evaluating
the use of pyrolyzed photoresist glassy carbon contacts, and assessing the utility of the wider water window
provided by Silicon-Carbide for enhanced neurochemical detection.
Spike Neuro will commercialize one or more designs from this work as a research tool as part of their existing
product line while continuing to work with Dr. Zestos toward clinical applications for the development of a multi-
biomarker closed-loop stimulation system."
10919066,"Chagas disease (CD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and transmitted by an insect
(triatomine) vector, congenitally, and via blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Vector-
borne transmission occurs widely in rural communities in continental Latin America, where an
estimated 6 million people in 21 countries are infected. Migration from Latin America to other
regions has resulted in an estimated 300,000 infected individuals in the US and tens of
thousands in Europe. T. cruzi infection is life-long in the absence of successful treatment, but
most infected individuals are asymptomatic and unaware of their infection. One-third of those
infected develop cardiac or gastrointestinal disease decades after the acute infection. Thus,
the detection of asymptomatic infected individuals is essential to enable early
treatment, decrease the likelihood of chronic morbidity and prevent congenital
transmission.
The overall goal of this direct to Phase II project is to develop a second-generation Chagas
Detect PlusTM Rapid test (CDPv2) with ≥ 97% sensitivity and ≥ 95% specificity by optimizing
CDPv2 prototype performance and transitioning to manufacture. Finally, studies required for
FDA 510k clearance and CLIA waiver of CDPv2 for marketing in the US and globally will be
planned and conducted. The result of this Phase II award will be an FDA- cleared, CLIA waived
robust point-of-care rapid test, matching the sensitivity of the original CDP while providing high
specificity and operational flexibility for meeting Chagas disease testing needs in the US and
beyond, within an accelerated timeline. The CDPv2 is substantially innovative in that as an
FDA- cleared and CLIA-waived rapid test, it can be deployed as a stand-alone test for sero-
surveillance and monitoring as well as integrated into an existing diagnostic algorithm, as
needed in both endemic and non- endemic regions while pairing with the reader adds to its
objectivity and utility.
Our objectives for this direct to Phase II proposal will build on finalizing between the two highest
performing prototypes we have generated to replace CDP and by improving performance to
≥97% sensitivity and ≥95% specificity. The down-selected prototype will then be manufactured
under GMP for delivering lots that will be used for analytical and clinical studies as required by
the FDA. The outcome will be an FDA- cleared CDPv2 as a replacement for CDP, but suitable
for use in CLIA waived settings as well."
10924604,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Schizophrenia is among the most severe and burdensome medical conditions worldwide, yet the brain alterations
that lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia remain unknown. This K23 application presents a research and training
program that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused
on understanding the neurobiology of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The activities in this application
build on the candidate’s prior training and are set in a resource-rich environment that will foster her development of
expertise in 1) application of MRS and advanced MRI neuroimaging methodologies; 2) physician-scientist approaches to
studying pathophysiology in patients with schizophrenia; 3) neurocircuitry and systems neuroscience perspectives on
hippocampus pathology in psychotic disorders; and 4) responsible conduct of research. The overarching goal of the
research to be carried out in this application is to take findings from animal models of schizophrenia, which were
motivated by original research in patients with the disorder, back to the clinical setting in order to determine whether
the brain circuit alterations observed in the animal models are observable in human patients. Specifically, findings in the
prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent model, which was developed to model the alterations in
dopamine function seen in patients with schizophrenia, suggest hyperactivity of the ventral (anterior) hippocampus may
increase its glutamatergic output to the ventral striatum and lead, via ventral pallidal and other GABAergic projections to
the ventral midbrain, to disinhibited firing of dopamine neurons. In addition, a convergence of several post mortem and
in vivo imaging findings in patients suggests that abnormal GABAergic activity in the hippocampus may further
compound hippocampal glutamatergic overdrive. This project will directly test the relationships among these
neurochemical alterations in individual medication-free patients with schizophrenia using sophisticated magnetic
resonance imaging methods. If this non-invasive, multimodal imaging paradigm provides evidence to relate hippocampal
GABA and glutamate abnormalities to dopamine system dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia, it would have
important implications for the understanding of the brain bases of schizophrenia, and would generate a novel
multimodal imaging paradigm for testing new molecular, anatomical, and circuit-modulating targets for treatment of
this devastating illness."

10927267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infantile rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a newly identified and poorly understood aggressive cancer with immature
skeletal muscle properties that affects young children. Recent clinical sequencing efforts have identified a
spectrum of likely biologically related gene fusions that genetically define infantile RMS: the most common being
a fusion between two transcriptional co-activators with roles in normal muscle development, termed VGLL2-
NCOA2. Although we know the defining oncogenic event, there are no therapies targeting the genetics of the
disease. Thus, patients are treated with general chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, often ineffectively or with
harsh long-term side effects. There is a pressing need to understand the biology of infantile RMS, contextualize
infantile RMS biology with other RMS sub-types, and leverage this information to delineate therapeutic targets.
Progress is limited by a lack of animal models, cell lines, and PDXs to study the disease dynamics. My long-term
goal is to integrate vertebrate zebrafish, mouse, cell culture models and patient samples to identify conserved
genetic programs for RMS tumorigenesis and novel therapeutic strategies. Toward that end, this project’s main
objective is to elucidate the underlying biology and therapeutic targets in fusion-oncogene driven infantile RMS.
Our central hypothesis is that VGLL2-NCOA2 leverages normal developmental programs, including ARF6, to
mediate infantile RMS tumorigenesis, and that targeting these pathways is a therapeutic opportunity. Our specific
aims will address this hypothesis by: (Aim 1) Delineating VGLL2-NCOA2 structure-function requirements for
tumorigenesis, (Aim 2) Establishing mechanisms of VGLL2-NCOA2 and ARF6 cooperation in
rhabdomyosarcoma, and (Aim 3) Determining VGLL2-NCOA2 muscle lineage context and temporal
prerequisites for tumorigenesis. Completing these studies at the interface of developmental and cancer biology
will generate significant new knowledge regarding fusion-oncogene leveraging of developmental programs and
will identify potential therapeutic targets. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it leverages
a cross-species comparative oncology approach to pinpoint the most important molecular drivers in a new
disease, and it is experimentally innovative because it utilizes multiple new vertebrate (zebrafish and mouse)
infantile RMS models developed by our group. Successful execution of this project will generate exciting data
focused on delineating the basic biology of infantile rhabdomyosarcoma to directly impact and guide clinical care."

prerequisites for tumorigenesis. Completing these studies at the interface of developmental and cancer biology
will generate significant new knowledge regarding fusion-oncogene leveraging of developmental programs and
will identify potential therapeutic targets. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it leverages
a cross-species comparative oncology approach to pinpoint the most important molecular drivers in a new

infantile RMS models developed by our group. Successful execution of this project will generate exciting data
focused on delineating the basic biology of infantile rhabdomyosarcoma to directly impact and guide clinical care."

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness worldwide. DR progresses in many patients despite
preventable measures such as blood sugar and blood pressure control. Other available treatments require
invasive eye injections and are often ineffective—DR remains the leading cause of legal blindness among
working-age adults. Current diagnostic tests fail to identify early disease stages or predict disease progression.
Consequently, new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies are needed.
DR is an established inflammatory disease with leukocyte involvement. Many inflammatory cytokines (products
of leukocytes) are consistently elevated in the aqueous and vitreous of patients with advanced DR and diabetic
macular edema (DME). Inflammatory mediators are candidates for direct biomarkers that may predict DR
progression as well as treatment response. To date the only validated prognostic DR biomarker is the
circulating glycemia marker glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). HbA1C screening, however, reflects glucose
control, which indicates disease risk as opposed to DR pathology.
Our central hypothesis is that intraocular inflammatory mediators such as PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 are markers of
DR severity and therefore predict risk of disease progression. Equally important, they represent potential novel
targets for inhibition. We have recently demonstrated that topically applied ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug, achieves therapeutic vitreous levels and significantly reduces several elevated
inflammatory mediators in eyes with DR. These observations and its commercial availability provide rationale to
investigate the relationship of inflammatory mediators with DR severity and the long-term effects of chronic
topical administration of ketorolac in diabetic patients.
Our current goals include confirming inflammation mediators are biomarkers of both systemic diabetes and DR
progression in the aqueous. Like the vitreous humor, the aqueous reflects localized ocular inflammation,
however, is technically easier to collect with less risk. We will also determine the long-term effects of sustained
ketorolac application on intraocular cytokine levels, DR progression, and DME incidence. Our proposal is the
first to use a cornea-permeable NSAID for the treatment of DR.
We believe local inflammation control in the eye will transform future treatment options for diabetic patients
facing blindness. Tracking and inhibiting local inflammatory mediators through all DR stages has the capacity
to reduce or prevent disability in millions of patients per year."

The long-range goal of this research is to explore how HIV-1, when suppressed by anti-retroviral therapy (ART),
sustains the immune activation and consequent accelerated aging that underlie the survival gap between people
living with HIV (PLWH) and the general population. HIV-1 itself is likely a key driver of immune activation.
However, in the setting of low levels of virus replication, it is unclear how HIV-1 continues to cause inflammation.
We propose that monocyte activation by immune complexes (ICs) made of Gag, HIV-1 RNA, and anti-Gag IgG
contribute to chronic inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction in ART-treated PLWH. This notion arises from
our preliminary data indicating that nucleic acid-containing ICs stimulate monocytes in vitro to produce
inflammatory chemokines. Such ICs are likely to be present in ART-treated patients whose viremia is well
controlled, because in addition to replicating virus, genomes of defective virus—which makes up >90% of the
reservoir virus in treated patients—can transcribe RNA and encode Gag. Moreover, most individuals maintain
anti-Gag antibodies despite undetectable plasma viremia. Consistent with the idea that nucleic acid-containing
ICs promote immune activation is the intriguing observation that natural hosts of SIV, who resolve immune
activation, have very low or undetectable anti-Gag antibodies, whereas such antibodies are readily measured in
pathogenic SIV infection of macaques. In addition, patients with autoimmune disorders such as lupus, make IgG
that binds to nucleic acids or to ribonucleoproteins. Like PLWH, patients with lupus have endothelial cell
dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis. Analogous to what we propose for IgG-Gag-RNA ICs, nucleic acid-
containing ICs in lupus are internalized by phagocytes through Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) where they engage TLRs
and mediate inflammation. To test the hypothesis that ICs consisting of Gag, RNA and anti-Gag IgG mediate
immune activation, we will accomplish two specific aims: Aim 1: Measure the inflammatory response to
nucleic acid-containing ICs in healthy, human FcγR-transgenic mice. Mice will be treated with HIV-1 Gag
(p55, which contains the RNA-binding domain NCp7) and HIV-1 RNA with or without anti-Gag human IgG1.
Markers of immune activation and microbial translocation will be measured. Specific Aim 2: Using human
vascularized micro-organs (VMO's), assess interactions between nucleic acid-containing ICs,
monocytes, and endothelial cells (ECs). Since endothelial dysfunction plays a role in diseases contributing to
mortality in ART-treated PLWH, we will use VMOs to assess the impact of ICs and monocytes on the vasculature.
VMOs (three dimensional models allowing physiological flow, EC function and gene expression) will be treated
with monocytes and ICs, and vascular permeability, cytokine expression, and in situ expression of adhesion
molecules will be measured. The proposed research is designed to determine whether or not nucleic acid-
containing ICs drive the immune activation and endothelial dysfunction that contribute to reduced life expectancy
in PLWH. Novel therapeutic strategies to provide a functional cure for HIV may emerge from our research."
10918066,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 ADP-ribosylation is an important post-translational modification that directly influences several
biological processes including cancer, allergy, and infectious disease. ADP-ribose can be added to proteins as
one or more consecutive units by ADP-ribosyltransferases, also termed PARPs, resulting in mono- or poly-
ADP-ribosylation (mAR or pAR). Most mARylating PARPs are upregulated by interferon (IFN) upon virus
infection and several are predicted to have antiviral functions. In addition, several viral families, including the
Coronaviridae and Togaviridae, encode for macrodomain proteins that have mono-ADP-ribosyl hydrolase
(ARH) activity. This activity allows these viruses the ability to specifically counteract the effects of mAR, further
implicating mAR in the mammalian antiviral response. Despite these findings, there are only a few known
examples where mAR is known to inhibit virus replication. This is largely due to the lack of cell culture models
of virus infections where the mAR status of a cell can be specifically controlled, such as models using mutant
viruses or PARP knockout cells that have significant phenotypes. Importantly, the PI has established a virus
infection system using a model coronavirus, Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), where virus lacking ARH activity is
i) significantly impaired in virus replication and ii) independently induces a robust IFN response. These
phenotypes are reversed by PARP inhibitors, establishing mAR as a key factor driving this anti-viral response.
 The investigator’s long-term goal is to determine mechanistically how mAR inhibits virus replication and
enhances the innate immune response following virus infection. This gap in knowledge will be resolved by
answering the following questions: 1) How does mAR inhibit MHV infection? Does it inhibit the entry, RNA
replication, protein translation, assembly, or release of MHV? 2) What step(s) of the IFN induction pathway is
enhanced by mAR, and does mAR also affect the IFN response in bats, which are known to harbor many
highly pathogenic viruses? 3) What proteins are modified by PARPs following virus infection and which
substrates are relevant for specific phenotypes? The rationale for this research is that it will enhance our
understanding of mAR, including its ability to modulate protein function and will uncover novel cellular proteins
or processes that mediate virus replication. The work is innovative because: i) it will bridge a significant
knowledge gap between ADP-ribose biology, the innate immune response, and virus replication; ii) it utilizes
unique models of infection utilizing both mutant viruses and PARP knockout cells; and iii) will be the first to
address the role of mAR in bats. Finally, these projects are significant and relevant to the NIGMS mission
because they will provide a thorough understanding of how mAR impacts the anti-viral response that could lay
the foundation for advances in the treatment of virus infections or other human diseases impacted by mAR."

People with psychotic illnesses perceive and believe things about themselves, the outside world
and other people that do not obtain. This can be very distressing for them, their family members
and friends. Listening to and performing music can help mitigate this distress, but we do not
know why. This project aims to find out. Perceiving and believing, about self and others, is
achieved by making predictions and updating those predictions in light of new evidence,
particularly if that new evidence is very reliable or precise. One way that music might help
psychosis involves this precision. By making one set of predictions more precise—predictions
about music— other predictions can change. This might be why we tap our toes or sing along to
music we enjoy. We propose that experiencing more reliable predictions about ones’ actions (by
singing) and other people (by singing along with them) will help to change the predictions that
underwrite the symptoms of psychosis. We will test whether this is true in an initial R61 study,
tracking the change in performance of a series of prediction-based tasks as a result of musical
experience by prosecuting three specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will examine the impact of song-
making in a group (SING) on conditioned hallucination task performance, a procedure that
safely and reliably engenders hallucinations in the laboratory. We predict SING will reduce the
number and mechanisms of hallucinations in the laboratory. Specific Aim 2 will examine how
social learning changes with SING. Using a reputation learning task, we will measure social
learning rates. We predict they will increase with SING. Specific Aim 3 will examine
participants’ subjective experience of self-hood and how they change with SING using
computational linguistic analysis. We predict SING will decrease linguistic markers of distress. If
those studies prove successful, we will – in a follow-up R33 study – use metrics from the R61 to
decompose the musical intervention into its key ingredients – asking whether it is important to
be active (or merely passively experience music), and whether owning the music produced is
important to its impact on precision of processing. These studies will help us refine whether,
how and to whom we deliver musical intervention for serious mental illness."

Malaria is a devastating parasitic disease that affects more than 200 million people annually, resulting in nearly
500,000 deaths each year. As of 2018, the World Health Organization estimates that 3.8 billion people, roughly
half the world's population, are at risk of contracting malaria, and the rise of drug-resistant parasites has created
a desperate need for new anti-malarial drugs. While most intracellular pathogens export a limited repertoire of
effector proteins to co-opt existing host-cell metabolic machineries, the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium
falciparum exports more than 10% of its proteome into its host, the human red blood cell, during the blood stages
of its life cycle. The hundreds of proteins in the P. falciparum exportome extensively remodel host erythrocytes,
creating the infrastructure needed to import nutrients, export waste, and evade the host immune system. The
export of these hundreds of proteins is complicated by the fact that the malaria parasite conceals itself inside a
parasitophorous vacuole (PV) derived from invagination of the host cell plasma membrane during invasion.
Following secretion into the PV, proteins destined for export must be unfolded and transported across the PV
membrane (PVM) into the host cell in an ATP-dependent process. The export pathway is essential for parasite
survival, making members of the pathway attractive potential drug targets. The complexity and breadth of its
host-cell remodeling machinery make P. falciparum a rich and exciting system for the study of host-pathogen
interactions. However, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying this parasite's ability to hijack human red
blood cells remain enigmatic, as much of the P. falciparum proteome has proven recalcitrant to structural and
biochemical characterization using traditional recombinant approaches. The goal of the proposed work is to
leverage and build upon the latest advances in single-particle cryo electron microscopy and cryo focused ion
beam-enabled in situ cryo electron tomography to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying effector
protein export in P. falciparum and to identify promising targets for structure-based design of new anti-malarial
therapeutics. Three aims are proposed to accomplish these goals: 1) Establish an in vitro translocation activity
assay for the Plasmodium Translocon of Exported Proteins (PTEX), a novel and essential membrane protein
complex, through which all exported effector proteins must pass in order to reach the host cell cytosol. The
established assay will enable biochemical characterization of the molecular mechanism of protein translocation
and screening of inhibitors obtained via structure-guided design of PTEX inhibitors. 2) Structure determination
of novel protein complexes of the P. falciparum exportome. 3) Direct visualization of the supramolecular effector
protein export machinery in situ at the host-pathogen interface in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. The
proposed work will provide insight into the pathogenesis of this deadly disease, identify new malarial drug targets,
and enable structure-guided design of novel anti-malarial therapeutics."

This eMERGE-4 program is focused on generating and validating polygenic risk scores (PRS) for multiple
phenotypes using multiple available datasets across the eMERGE network, followed by a site-specific
implementation of PRS in 2,500 prospectively recruited patients we perform at The Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania. To address health disparities and underrepresentation of African
Americans in genomic research, 75% (1,875) of participants will be of African ancestry. With capacity to pursue
many others, we propose five principal phenotypes: asthma, diabetes (T1D/T2D); autoimmune disease, Crohn’s
disease (CD); and hyperlipidemia with focus on coronary artery disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and clinical
efficacy/impact with respect to improved healthcare delivery will be measured. We will work with eMERGE
partners to develop a customized array that address inequities in traditional approaches, in particular, lack of
PRS data in minorities. We will establish an enriched recruitment, engagement, and retention protocol that will
include targeted recruitment, enhanced communication with participants and health care professionals, boosted
analysis and EHR integration, and a dynamic education program focusing on AAs with an aim to decrease
disparities in health by recruitment of minorities and improved health outcomes. The education program will be
informed by an empirical collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital, where we will examine ethical, legal, and
social implications (ELSI) of return of genomic risk estimates, specifically differences in risk perception and
willingness to participate in risk reduction recommendations based on how risk is framed, disease severity, age
of onset, and actionability. Results will inform return of genomic risk estimates to all 2,500 participants, and
assess healthcare outcomes across the key disease areas proposed. We will work with the consortium to
delineate best practices for returning genomic risk estimates and create an innovative return of results protocol.
Finally, we will integrate PRS and genomic risk estimates with patients’ electronic health records by leveraging
Care Assistant, an innovative clinical decision support (CDS) framework developed at CHOP. We will create
CDS integrated with the CHOP EHR and provider education in MyResults. In a cluster-randomized design using
our primary-care research network, we will test the hypothesis that implementation of CDS will increase the
uptake of risk reduction recommendations by both patients and providers compared to current EHR integration
(EHRI)."

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly transformed the treatment of EGFR mutant lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), their effectiveness is often limited by acquired drug resistance. In a significant portion
of the cases, resistance arises without detectable mutations or changes in gene copy numbers, suggesting
epigenetic mechanisms underlie resistance. Recent evidence indicates that the three-dimensional (3D) folding
organization of the genome regulates the cancer cell epigenome, which can activate oncogenes, inactivate tumor
suppressor genes, and promote metastasis and stemness. However, it remains unknown whether and how 3D
genome alternations contribute to resistance to targeted therapies. To address this knowledge gap, we have
developed a chromatin tracing strategy to visualize the 3D genome organization at the single-cell level in the
native cancer tissue context. We applied this method to a reliable mouse model of LUAD driven by the oncogene
Kras and identified characteristic alterations in the 3D genome during cancer development, including a notable
structural bottleneck in LUAD progression. Moreover, we demonstrated that the 3D genome encodes distinct
cancer states within individual cells and uncovers novel genetic dependencies in LUAD, highlighting the critical
role of 3D genome reorganization in LUAD development. Based on these findings, we propose that structural
changes in the 3D genome similarly mediate resistance to targeted therapies. To investigate this hypothesis, we
intend to employ our in situ chromatin tracing approach to examine how the 3D genome reorganizes in the
context of EGFR inhibitor resistance using human LUAD cancer cell lines, patient biospecimens, and PDX
models, extending studies on the epigenetic basis of TKI resistance in the parent P50 award to an entirely new
layer of epigenetic information, the 3D genome. By utilizing our established analytical methods, we will decipher
the resistance mechanisms encoded by the 3D genome and validate their functional significance through genetic
and pharmacological experiments in both cell culture and animal models. These studies will foster the
development of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers of drug resistance based on single-cell 3D genome
conformations and aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance."
10792640,"Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically, which requires a combination of many highly toxic 
drugs and radiation therapy, is not curative. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-L1/PD-1 are
causing a paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment, yet the 5-year survival rate remains below 20%. 
This Fast-Track SBIR application aims to develop a novel nano-immunotherapy (termed ARAC - Antigen 
Release Agent and Checkpoint Inhibitor) that can greatly improve the efficacy of ICIs leading to curative 
outcomes for NSCLC patients. ARAC is built upon our core nanoparticle platform capable of co-delivering
multiple therapeutic agents, while keeping a small size in saline (100 nm), suitable for infusion and tumor 
accumulation. The proposed ARAC-02 will co-deliver a polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)-targeted therapy (volasertib),
a PD-L1 antibody, and the immune-stimulant CpG. Volasertib 1) selectively kills cancer cells, 2) modulates the 
immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, and 3) upregulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, providing
opportunity for targeted delivery with PD-L1 antibody on the nanoparticles. CpG is an oligonucleotide that 
enhances antigen presentation to generate tumor-specific T cells. The nanoparticles contain a very high 
surface density of PD-L1 antibodies (two thousand per particle), which promotes binding to PD-L1 molecules 
on cancer cells, followed by internalization and PD-L1 degradation (as effective as 30-fold free PD-L1 
antibody), releasing the brakes and allowing T cells to attack the cancer. When given intravenously to mice 
bearing lung tumors, the nanoparticle co-delivering volasertib and PD-L1 antibody reduced the necessary dose 
for efficacy of each drug by 5-fold. Adding CpG to the nanoconstructs triggers greater adaptive anti-cancer 
immunity in a bilateral NSCLC mouse model, leading to complete cures for some mice. The platform was also 
found to be safe in monkeys.
In Phase I (Aim 1), ARAC-02 will be optimized for loading of volasertib, PD-L1 antibody, and CpG. Materials 
will be screened for size, targeting specificity, efficacy in NSCLC cells, and efficacy and safety in mice.
In Phase II, the pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, efficacy, and safety of the optimal ARAC-02 will be assessed, 
both alone (Aim 2) and in combination with the current first-line immunotherapy (Aim 3). Clinically relevant 
orthotopic NSCLC mouse models that are resistant to ICIs will be utilized, and findings will be validated in 
humanized mice bearing two different patient-derived tumors that represent heterogeneous NSCLC in patients. 
The free drugs, single-drug-loaded nanoparticles, and first-line immunotherapy will be used as benchmarks. 
Due to its unique ability to stimulate various steps of the adaptive immune response, ARAC-02 is anticipated to 
provide curative outcomes, especially when used with current ICIs for complete blockade. ARAC-02 can 
upregulate PD-L1 levels thereby promoting efficacy in a broad range of tumor types regardless of baseline PD-L1 levels. Outcomes will be candidate selection and critical data towards an IND application and clinical trials."
10925894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV persists despite decades of antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of a population of latently infected CD4+ T
cells known as the HIV reservoir. The HIV reservoir is sustained by proliferation of infected CD4+ T cells, which
do not express enough viral protein to be eliminated by HIV-specific immune responses. While proliferation of
cells is a promising target for curing HIV and eliminating the need for lifelong ART, a comprehensive preclinical
structure to develop a lymphocyte anti-proliferation therapeutic strategy does not exist.
The optimal timing of anti-proliferative (AP) therapy is also unknown. Recent evidence suggests that CD4+ T
cell proliferation plays a vital role in generating multiple proliferative clones of latently infected cells extremely
early during untreated HIV infection. We developed a mathematical model which suggests that massive CD4+
T cell proliferation coincident with recovery from CD4+ lymphopenia, occurs during weeks 1-4 of primary HIV
infection and is vital for generating much of the HIV reservoir. We hypothesize that effective AP therapy given
during this critical three-week window will limit the volume and alter the clonal structure of the HIV reservoir.
In Aim 1 of this application, Dr. Adam Spivak will test small molecular agents targeting CD4+ T cell proliferation
given alone and in combination. A comprehensive library of immunomodulatory and chemotherapeutic agents
with high therapeutic potential will be tested for their AP effects ex vivo on uninfected CD4+ T cell cultures, ex
vivo on latently HIV-1 infected cells derived from human donors, and in vivo in uninfected rhesus macaques by
measuring impact on CD4+ T cell turnover using deuterium water labeling. Finally, Dr. Joshua Schiffer will utilize
mathematical models which capture drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as the underlying
dynamics of CD4+ T cell subsets within the HIV reservoir, to optimize selection of single drug or combination
anti-proliferative (AP) regimens for dosing of SIV infected animals in Aim 2. Drug regimens will first be ranked
in a tabular form according to predicted potency. The most potent regimen with known safety in humans and
lack of cell toxicity in Dr. Spivak’s ex vivo model will ultimately be selected for Aim 2.
In Aim 2, Dr. Joseph Mudd will evaluate the effects of optimized AP agents on early reservoir formation dynamics
in 24 SIV-infected rhesus macaques: 6 will receive ART alone between weeks 1-37 post infection; 6 will receive
ART alone between weeks 4-40 post infection; 6 will receive ART between weeks 1-37 and optimized AP therapy
between weeks 1-4 post infection; 6 will receive ART between weeks 4-40 and optimized AP therapy between
weeks 1-4 post infection. Optimized AP regimens will be selected based on Dr. Spivak’s experimental data from
Aim 1 coupled with Dr. Schiffer’s mathematical models.
During ART, we will measure the in vivo AP therapeutic effect on 1) SIV reservoir volume with total and intact
SIV DNA, 2) reservoir CD4+ T cell subset composition, 3) in vivo CD4+ T cell turnover with D2O labeling, and 4)
SIV reservoir clonal structure using integration site sequencing, based on frequent longitudinal sampling of blood
and gut tissues. After 36 weeks of ART, we will stop ART and monitor viral rebound for up to 4 months. We
hypothesize that AP therapy between weeks 1 and 4 post infection will reduce total and intact SIV DNA and
decrease reservoir clonality following 6 months of ART and increase time to SIV rebound after ART interruption."
10925897,"Perceptual distortions in the form of hallucinations and illusions are defining characteristics of psychotic
psychopathology. Recent evidence suggests that the formation of percepts is directly influenced by cycling
neural activity (i.e., oscillations) captured in brain wave recordings and reflective of processes by which brain
circuits encode stimuli. The pace of the resting state alpha cycle (~8-12 Hz) appears to govern the speed at
which visual input is sampled with faster alpha oscillations yielding more accurate visual perception. But it is
unknown whether abnormal oscillations evident during the brain’s default mode can account for the distorted
perceptions that characterize psychosis. The current project is an investigation of the role of default mode
oscillations in perceptual dysfunction in schizophrenia, and tests whether altering oscillations can improve
visual perception. The overarching hypothesis is that schizophrenia is associated with slowed alpha
oscillations that contribute to visual perceptual dysfunction evident during experimental tasks and real-world
situations where illusions and hallucinations occur.
 To investigate alpha oscillations as a possible mechanism of reality distortion in psychosis the proposed
work involves the following aims. First, electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to measure individual alpha
peak frequency (IAPF) in people with schizophrenia and healthy controls to determine how the speed of default
mode resting state oscillations is relevant to visual perceptual functions commonly disturbed in schizophrenia.
Data from a binocular rivalry task that samples endogenous processes of percept formation will be used to test
the hypothesis that individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF) reflects the rate of sampling of visual information
and determines the pace of percept formation. It is expected that slowed alpha oscillations in schizophrenia
reflect impaired neural functions that underly percept formation and limit the ability to discern visual stimuli. It is
also predicted that slowed alpha oscillations in schizophrenia are related to cognitive impairment, clinical
symptomatology, and real-world visual distortions in the disorder. Functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) data will
be simultaneously collected with EEG to isolate regions of the thalamus and occipital cortex that are
associated with alpha oscillations. fMRI will be used to test the hypothesis that slowed alpha reflects reduced
thalamic-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia.
 Second, advanced time-frequency (TF) analysis techniques of EEG will be used to examine how default
mode oscillations relate to the synchronization of neural responses during the processing of visual stimuli. This
will help reveal how IAPF influences visual perceptual disturbances in schizophrenia. In addition to showing
that decreased speed of alpha oscillations is associated with decreased synchronization of oscillations to
briefly displayed visual stimuli (i.e., DS-CPT), it is expected that decreased synchronization of oscillations will
predict worse perceptual function, clinical symptomatology, and real-world visual distortions in schizophrenia.
We will use simultaneously acquired fMRI data to examine whether decreased alpha synchronization during
visual processing is associated with reduced modulation of connectivity between thalamus and occipital cortex
in schizophrenia.
 Third, we will modulate alpha oscillations to causally influence visual perception. A flickering visual display
will be used to entrain neural oscillations and briefly alter IAPF during visual perceptual tasks. The
manipulation of IAPF will specifically test whether modulation of the speed of the alpha rhythm yields improved
visual perceptual function in people with schizophrenia. Entrainment of oscillations 2 Hz above IAPF as
compared to 2 Hz below IAPF is expected to increase the speed of percept formation as measured during
binocular rivalry and improve visual perceptual performance as measured by the DS-CPT.
 The proposed work will inform future implementation of neuromodulatory interventions in Veterans."

As a participant in the new IDeA Regional Entrepreneurship Development (I-RED) program, the goal of
this proposal is to create an educational product to promote entrepreneurism and commercialization in the
Mountain West region of IDeA states. The educational product and overall program are intended to address
the needs of IDeA state academic institutions in developing and strengthening technology transfer programs
to stimulate technological innovation and the needs of IDeA state investigators in translating scientific
discoveries and technologies from research laboratories into commercial products that improve human
health and promote economic growth in IDeA states.
Many factors limit the goal of successfully commercializing basic and translational science in IDeA states.
These include a lack of knowledge and understanding among innovators regarding how technologies are
brought to market, a lack of exposure to entrepreneurial and commercialization education, training, and
mentoring (in areas such as patents, startups, business plan development, venture capital and angel
investing), a limited knowledge of technology transfer processes and SBIR/STTR programs, and limited
resources in university Technology Transfer Offices.
To address these deficits, we will develop an entrepreneurship educational product that can be utilized by
academic institutions, especially those in IDeA states, to inspire, train, and support their students and
faculty to explore entrepreneurial opportunities. The product will consist of didactic and interactive forms
of courses, including manuals, case reports, and databases. These will develop and enhance academic
scientists’ entrepreneurial knowledge and skills such as patent filing, business plan development, capital
raising, bookkeeping, financial management, business operation, and marketing, ultimately enhancing
skills to compete for SBIR/STTR grants and to pursue entrepreneurial interests in academic
environments. The product will be developed through a rigorous research and development process
(including needs assessment, testing, validation and evaluation) and marketed for commercialization.
The goals of this application in Phase I are to: 1) Establish the Hub structure, governance, and leadership
plan; 2) Complete needs analyses, set product development goals, complete product design, develop
prototypes and effective plans for testing; 3) Develop pilot project funding opportunity announcements, solicit
applications, and establish processes to evaluate and select projects for funding; and 4) Implement an
evaluation plan to monitor Phase I progress. In Phase II, our goals are to: 1) Refine the educational product
through implementation and testing at academic institutions; 2) Fund Pilot Projects and validate the educational
product through Pilot Projects and SBIR/STTR application; 3) Develop and implement commercialization plans
for the educational product; and 4) Implement an evaluation plan to monitor Phase II progress."

Irinotecan, a prodrug of SN-38, is used to treat many types of metastatic and drug-resistant cancers, and often
represents the therapy of the last resort. Unfortunately, a large percentage (up to 40%) of these patients will
experience serious (Grade 2) and severe (Grade 3-4) delayed-onset diarrhea (SDOD), which really downgrade
patient’s quality of life. SDOD may lead to prolonged hospitalization and even death in some instances. The
long-term goal of our research is to develop experimental therapeutics and/or nutritional supplemental approach
to reduce SDOD, so patients can sustain their chemotherapy. Our recent studies have shown that inactivation
of intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) by SN-38 is a new mechanism by which SN-38 causes
SDOD, and that a Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (XCHT), could attenuate the inactivation of
intestinal UGTs in mice. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this current proposal is Therefore, we hypothesize
that XCHT will prevent or reduce irinotecan-induced SDOD by attenuating the decline in UGT activities, reducing
gut SN-38 exposure, and promoting the recovery of gut UGT activities. We plan to test this hypothesis using four
Specific Aims: (1) perform phytochemical, biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic characterization of XCHT to
enable quality control, systemic and intestinal drug exposure determinations, and to provide bioanalytical
methods and pharmacokinetic parameters needed for a clinical study and PK/PD modeling; (2) validate plasma
raloxifene-4′-glucuronide levels as a probe to changes in intestinal Ugt/UGT activity; (3) Perform mouse “co-
trial” studies to support human mechanistic trials and to determine the mechanisms of action of XCHT against
irinotecan-induced SDOD using both in vitro and in vivo models; and (4) Conduct a mechanistic clinical trial using
a randomized double-blind design with a safety “Run-In” to determine if XCHT can attenuate human intestinal
UGT decrease and reduce incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea caused by irinotecan chemotherapy. Aside
from these primary outcomes, we will also determine if levels of Ral-4’-G, a probe of intestinal UGT activities is
(negatively) correlated with systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines. Success gained through this research will
provide a new mechanism by which we can target to treat SDOD caused by irinotecan chemotherapy."

Globally, 75% of people living with HIV (PLWH) are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only 67% of them
are virally suppressed, with ART medication nonadherence as a key barrier. Routines are associated with high
long-term medication adherence, but have been difficult to establish through interventions. One promising
routinization approach is to pair, or ‘anchor,’ a new behavior to an already existing routine, as behaviors
consistently performed in response to the same contextual cue (e.g., an existing routine) are carried out with
little or no cognitive effort. However, such anchoring interventions do not support participants during the lengthy
routinization process and typically work only for participants with high motivation. In a novel R34 pilot study, we
successfully established ART pill-taking routines by incorporating behavioral economics insights into the
traditional anchoring approach. We used components from current anchoring interventions (e.g., asking all
participants to create an anchoring plan by picking an existing routine to pair with their ART pill-taking) and
augmented them in two ways based on our proven behavioral economics-based intervention components: (1) in
a Messages group, participants received daily reminder messages for three months to increase salience and
help participants stick to their anchoring plan; and (2) an Incentives group received the same messages but also
small monthly prizes for taking ART pills around the time of their chosen existing routine to combat participants’
present bias. We found that participants who stuck with their anchoring plans maintained high ART adherence,
even after the messages and prizes were withdrawn, and that messages alone were sufficient for some
participants while others needed both messags and prizes to successfully routinize ART adherence. Thus, in
this R01 proposal we will test these intervention components in a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized
Trial (SMART) design to identify the optimal sequencing (from low-resource messages to higher-resource prizes)
to cost-effectively promote long-term ART adherence among all treatment initiators. The Specific Aims are to:
SA1 (Primary): Test the first-stage main effect of Messages vs. Control on the maintenance of ART adherence
(primary outcome) and viral suppression (secondary outcome). SA2 (Secondary): Examine (a) the second-stage
main effect of receiving monthly vs. weekly prizes on the primary and secondary outcomes among first-stage
non-responders, and (b) the total intervention effect of Messages among responders vs. the first- and second-
stage components among non-responders. SA3: Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, including a comparison
of INMIND components among responders and non-responders, and conduct information dissemination
activities in Uganda after completion of the trial. The results of this study can be generalized to other chronic
diseases requiring long-term medication adherence, and our cost-effectiveness analysis and information
dissemination activities will inform our subsequent Stage V implementation research."

“High-risk” human papillomavirus (HPV) types such as 16 (HPV-16) are identified in the majority of HPV-associated pre-malignant and malignant pathologies of cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal epithelia. The 
E6 protein is essential for viral replication. Structure-based computational screening followed by design and 
synthesis of derivatives led to the identification of a series of small molecules that bind to the HPV-16 E6
protein and inhibits its association with the E6AP ubiquitin ligase in vitro as well as E6-mediated p53 
degradation in cells. Using iterative cycles of structure based drug design and rigorous biochemical assays, 
Kovina Therapeutics’ academic collaborators have identified more potent E6 inhibitory compounds. Kovina 
has an exclusive worldwide license to these discoveries. The objective of this STTR application is to
characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of these unique E6 inhibitors and identify the best candidates for 
advancement as therapeutics. Specific inhibition of growth of HPV-16 xenograft tumors will serve as proof of 
concept validation for our lead candidates. We are ideally positioned to perform and complete requisite 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic and toxicologic studies in the SBIR phase, leading to IND-enabling selection 
of a clinical lead. Having developed and executed the experiments described in this project, the PI, Dr. Anne 
Rietz, is superbly suited to continue these investigations. She will be mentored by senior leaders from 
academia and the drug industry. Kovina’s CEO and Board Chair, who have successfully grown and managed 
two biotech companies that were acquired, will also mentor Dr. Rietz. Along with other mentoring venues and 
business school courses, Dr. Rietz will transition to a career in corporate drug development."
10925254,"The innovative University of Minnesota Cancer Research And Teaching Excellence: M-CREATE program
leverages ten years of high school and undergraduate health equity cancer research-focused mentorship and
education activities, to implement a theoretically guided, evidence driven program designed to grow the
numbers of cancer-focused scientists from groups underrepresented in science, and promote their academic
developmental progress towards future careers in cancer research. M-CREATE will combine the experiences
of our unique team including Masonic Cancer Center and Program in Health Disparities Research leadership,
with best practices from education, mentorship, service learning, and parent education within a theoretical and
equity-oriented frame to engage, educate, and support students to achieve the knowledge, skills, science
identity, and self-efficacy required to support academic persistence and long-term success within the
biomedical and behavioral sciences. The long-term goal of this proposal is to address the pressing needs of
our increasingly diverse patient population in Minnesota and the United States (U.S.) by enhancing the
diversity of the cancer-focused research workforce. We will support the academic persistence of first, 240 early
high school students attending two urban school districts comprised of approximately seventy percent Native
American students and students of color, through a multicomponent, staged program combining hands on
research mentorship, academic and professional development, science-oriented identity development, parent
support, and community-engaged service learning. Four cohorts of 60 students will participate in an initial
engagement year comprised of supportive and exciting hands-on experiences. Ten students per cohort will
continue in an intensive experience including two nine-week summer mentored research experiences and a
community-engaged service learning experience. Next, 60 early-stage undergraduate students
underrepresented in science will participate in a nine-week summer program combining academic and
professional development and hands on research mentorship. Finally, we will deepen the science-focused
skills of high school teachers from collaborating districts serving students underrepresented in science through
a hands-on research lab experience paired with evidence-based support to develop curricula responsive to the
needs of diverse learners. Diversifying the cancer research workforce is critical to addressing the pressing
needs of increasingly diverse patient populations in Minnesota and across the U.S. M-CREATE aligns strongly
with NCI strategic priorities to strengthen the cancer research workforce and mitigate cancer disparities."
10932397,"It is well established that structured moderate to vigorous physical activity (i.e., aerobic and resistance
exercise) improves many physical and psychosocial health outcomes for cancer survivors. However, it is
estimated that less than half of cancer survivors are achieving the cancer-specific exercise guidelines.
Interventions that are supervised, and include theory-based behavior change strategies are effective for
increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among cancer survivors; but following an
intervention, many survivors return to previously inactive, or insufficiently active lifestyles. To achieve the many
benefits associated with MVPA or ‘exercise’, cancer survivors must not only adopt or begin a program, but also
be able to maintain these PA levels long-term. In addition to individual behavior change strategies,
interpersonal, and environmental support for PA can extend the success of PA interventions. This can be
achieved by increasing the accessibility of tailored, evidence-informed cancer-specific exercise programs at
community-based locations. Thus, we propose to engage in a research-practice partnership to deliver an
adaptive PA maintenance intervention for cancer survivors. In the R21 phase, we will examine acceptability of
maintenance intervention components, and conduct a needs assessment for intervention delivery at three-
community partner locations. In the R33 phase, we will utilize an adaptive intervention design to determine the
optimal level of support needed to maintain PA following a community-based exercise program. We will enroll
cancer survivors who are not currently achieving aerobic and resistance exercise guidelines in a three-month,
supervised, group-based exercise and PA behavior change program at one of three community fitness
facilities. Upon completion of the program, participants will be encouraged to continue exercising during a
three-month free-living follow-up period, during which time there will be no active intervention. After this follow-
up period, exercise levels will be assessed. Those who are not achieving aerobic and resistance exercise
guidelines for cancer survivors will be classified as ‘incomplete responders’ and randomized to one of two
subsequent interventions: (a) monthly PA behavior change discussion sessions, or (b) monthly PA behavior
change discussion sessions plus bi-weekly, exercise sessions. Responders will be randomized to either: (c) no
further intervention, or (d) monthly PA behavior change discussion sessions. After three-months of the
subsequent PA maintenance intervention, exercise levels will be assessed again (i.e., 6-months after
completion of the initial exercise program). This project is significant because it aims to develop a tailored
approach to enhancing PA maintenance, by identifying non-responders and providing them with the additional
support necessary to engage in MVPA long-term. Delivering the intervention in community-based facilities will
increase potential for scalability and widespread dissemination. Findings from this study will prepare our team
to test this intervention in a full-scale adaptive trial, powered for efficacy."
10923987,"Efficient and user-friendly paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia are needed in primary care. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment accurately detects cognitive impairment via an appealing tablet interface with automated scoring and EMR integration. With the first round of funding, we validated the paradigm in English and Spanish speakers, developed regression-based norms that accurately classify patients by their likelihood of impairment, identified racial and ethnic disparities and barriers to brain health care, and at UCSF primary care the paradigm increased diagnosis rates by 40%. The primary goals of the proposed work are to evaluate the effectiveness of the paradigm for improving brain health care via a large pragmatic trial, to address challenges to implementation, and to pioneer precision medicine approaches to reference group adjustments. In Aim 1, we will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in 26 Kaiser Southern California primary care clinics to determine the effectiveness of the paradigm on detection rates and other brain health outcomes. In Aim 2, we will identify and address challenges to implementation and sustainability. In Aim 3, we will further diversify our well-characterized reference group and refine our detection algorithms to adjust for social determinants of brain health (not race), which is novel and also critical for a paradigm to be appropriate for all members of the increasingly diverse U.S. older adult population. If successful, this work will produce a validated paradigm that is available to address the unmet need to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, in large and diverse populations seen in primary care, and provide useful information about wide scale implementation of the paradigm to mitigate healthcare disparities and improve brain health care."
10918437,"PROJECT SUMMARY
β-lactams including carbapenems are the most widely used antibiotic class. Carbapenem-resistant A.
baumannii (CRAB) represents the most extreme resistant human pathogen among the Acinetobacter
species, where acquisition and evolution of β-lactamases have essentially eliminated all therapeutic
options. CRAB infections are classified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an
“Urgent threat” and by the World Health Organization as a “Priority 1 critical threat”. To provide a new
therapeutic option against this prominent pathogen, Venatorx has identified a novel chemical series of
highly selective cyclic boronates that inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) like β-lactams but that are
impervious to the action of all β-lactamases. This research program aims to deliver a cyclic boronate PBP
inhibitor (boro-PBPi) for the treatment of CRAB infections that exploits porin mediated uptake rather than
siderophore conjugation, in order to avoid both inactivation by β-lactamases and reduced activity through
loss of siderophore uptake as has been observed with cefiderocol (Fetroja®). Significant strides in
microbiological activity have been achieved with the lead boro-PBPi VNRX-14791 exhibiting an MIC90 of
16 µg/mL relative to 128/64 µg/mL for ampicillin-sulbactam and 64/4 µg/mL for sulbactam-durlobactam
against 26 CRAB clinical isolates. Prototype boro-PBPi VNRX-6884 was bactericidal in vitro and
achieved proof of concept efficacy in the murine thigh infection model in carbapenem-producing A.
baumannii while possessing favorable selectivity, ADME and PK properties. Optimization efforts
proposed herein target a 4-fold improvement in antibacterial activity to reach an MIC90 ≤4 µg/mL, driven
by rational structure-guided design for AbPBP3 affinity as well as using specific physicochemical
properties to improve cellular accumulation in gram-negative bacteria. As contingency, we will also
explore optimization of inhibitors that target both AbPBP2 and AbPBP3 using a recently identified starting
point (VNRX-14841) to enhance efficacy in vivo through dual inhibition AbPBP2 and AbPBP3 that
function in the elongasome and divisome, respectively. Such an optimized boro-PBPi will be a first new
class antibiotic addressing resistance to β-lactams for the treatment of CRAB infections and a long-term
therapeutic solution to resistance development in A. baumannii."
10918822,"ABSTRACT
Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disorder commonly characterized by hypertension and the appear-
ance of proteins such as albumin in patient urine. This disorder occurs in ~5% of pregnancies worldwide and
is the second leading cause of maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The etiology of this disease is
poorly understood. This confounds therapeutic intervention and makes delivery the only recourse for saving
the mother. Prognostic and diagnostic tests for PE are highly desirable but currently are not unavailable. Our
team (Garovic) identified the presence of specialized kidney epithelial cells, podocytes, as well as podocyte-
derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the urine of patients with PE as novel biomarkers for this disease. Spe-
cifically, we demonstrated that the ratio of podocin to nephrin expressed on urinary EVs correlated with PE.
However, the technique used by us previously for quantifying podocin-to-nephrin ratios (nanoflow cytometry) is
too complex and labor intensive to be used widely for screening of pregnant women. Our project will fill this
technological gap and provide a simple-to-use diagnostic test for PE. This Phase II STTR project will leverage
an electrochemical immunoassay for detection of EV surface markers developed by our team during Phase I.
The immunoassay will be implemented in a novel electrochemical microtiter plate to enable simple and sensi-
tive screening patient urine for EV expression of podocin and nephrin. Activities outlined in this project will
represent an important step toward developing a clinical diagnostic test for PE that could be performed for all
pregnant women during their prenatal checkups.
Overall impact: Our vision is to develop a technology that will enable testing for PE at the point of point-of-
use, in the hospitals or OBGYN clinics. Detection of EV-based biomarkers in urine will allow a physician to di-
agnose preeclampsia before the clinical syndrome (hypertension and proteinuria) develops and will be specific
to all subtypes of the disease. If a test result is positive, a pregnancy will be deemed at risk for PE and will be
monitored more closely for symptoms and signs of this disease. This test will represent a paradigm shift in the
care for patients with preeclampsia."
10923886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Because most high-level cognition depends on working memory (WM) and its dysfunction causes a host of
cognitive impairments, researchers have spent decades trying to understand the neural mechanisms that
support WM. Recently, using sophisticated computational neuroimaging approaches researchers have
repeatedly decoded the contents of WM from patterns of neural activity in a widely distributed number of brain
areas. The format of the WM representation in early visual cortex, for instance, might have the same “sensory-
like” properties as the visual stimulus. Although sensory-like representations are less likely in higher-order brain
areas, the nature of these alternative representations has yet remained impenetrable. This gap in our knowledge
is a critical problem because a host of psychiatric and neurologic disorders stems from a primary WM
dysfunction. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which neural populations across the brain
encode WM representations, and how we might develop strategies to mitigate WM problems that impact the
quality of cognition. Our overall hypothesis is that what one sees and what one stores in WM can be distinct and
that distinction differs across the cortical hierarchy. The central aim of the project is to develop incisive data
analytic approaches that will reveal the nature of what is actually being encoded in the neural population
dynamics underlying WM storage. The rationale for the proposed research is that as we better understand the
neural mechanisms of WM, a strong theoretical framework will emerge within which strategies for understanding
and treating cognitive dysfunction will emerge. We test our central hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. 1)
We will model the neural population dynamics that code for distinct formats of WM representations. 2) We will
identify when and where neural populations encode WM representations that are abstractions of sensory
features. Strong preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of proposed work as well as initial support for the
hypotheses. Under Aim 1, using novel dimensionality reduction techniques suggest that neural populations code
for both a representation of the memorized stimulus and a representation of the specific stimulus feature that is
task relevant. Under Aim 2, using novel means to model and visualize WM representations revealed that neural
populations that are traditionally thought to encode visual stimulus features in WM also store abstractions that
can bear little resemblance to the original visual stimulus. Overall, the proposed work will generate the data
needed to unmask the representational format of WM across the cortical hierarchy. The approach is innovative
because it uses direct and unbiased computational approaches to model and visualize the representational
format of WM in ways that have not been applied in neuroimaging. The proposed research is significant because
it will provide key insights into the nature of WM representations in the human brain, in addition to providing new
targets for cognitive remediation in psychiatric, neurologic, and geriatric populations."

The Duke Aging Center Postdoctoral Research Training Program (RTP) has a proud history of training highly
skilled research scientists with strong backgrounds or interests in aging and rich potential for leadership in
gerontological research. This proposal builds on the program’s legacy of success to continue and refine the
RTP to produce the next generation of leaders in the field of aging research. The Duke RTP focuses on aging
research from a biopsychosocial perspective, and is committed to cultivating deep understanding among the
post-doctoral fellows of the biological processes, psychological factors, and social forces that influence health
and well-being in late life. Consistent with this theme, the RTP faculty and their facilities enable outstanding
research training in the following areas related to aging: Biomedical Sciences; Social Sciences, Health services
Research and Biostatistics; and Behavioral and Neurosciences. Applicants to the Duke RTP identify a mentor
or mentors within the institution and work collaboratively with them to create an NIH-format research proposal
and submit it along with a curriculum vita, graduate transcripts, career and training plans, and letters of
recommendation. Fellows are integrated into their mentors’ research programs and mentored through
collaborative and independent research projects. Fellows attend a weekly interdisciplinary research seminar
that follows a structured curriculum on the biopsychosocial aspects of aging and the interdisciplinary nature of
aging research, as well as topics on professional development, research design and analysis, and research
ethics. Other didactic offerings are tailored to the individual fellows’ needs based on their individual

This Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Research Training Grant renewal
application is submitted in response to Program Announcement PA-16-152. This is a renewal application to
continue to provide institutional T32 awards to train young physician-scientists who will become independent
investigators conducting research addressing important problems in human health. The application requests
continued resources to support four physician/scientists each year with MD or MD/PhD degrees who receive
mentored research that focuses on the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of pediatric malignancies. The
overall objective of this T32 program is to train new investigators who will improve the care of children with
cancer. The rationale for the program is based on the substantial burden of pediatric cancer in the United
States and the well-documented and critical need to provide mentored career development support for young
physicians that will enable them to become fully independent and productive laboratory researchers. As such,
they will be poised to improve the health of children with cancer throughout the world by bringing state-of-the-
art expertise to bear on problems such as inherited predispositions, environmental factors, the toxic and
relatively non-specific nature of current therapies, and long-term adverse effects of mutagenic treatments. The
design of this program involves harnessing the expertise of world-class research scientists who serve as
mentors for interdisciplinary training. We have successfully implemented distinct training tracks for laboratory-
based and clinical/translational investigators. We believe that the progress of this T32 program since its
inception in 2007 demonstrates that UCSF has the vision, experience, and infrastructure to train the next
generation of leaders in childhood cancer research. In this renewal application, we provide evidence that the
Department or Pediatrics and Division of Oncology together with the broader UCSF research community
comprise an exceptional environment for preparing young physicians for productive careers as independent
investigators the field of childhood cancer. This application describes a comprehensive plan for identifying,
training, and mentoring these individuals. This application is directly relevant to human health as it requests
funds to support mentored career development for outstanding young physician/investigators who will become
independent researchers in the field of childhood cancer. Programs like this one represent an investment in the
future of public health as the researchers who are trained through this award will be equipped to harness state-
of-the-art research techniques to attack a formidable health problem in the pediatric population. The long-term
outcome of intensive and innovative training provided by this T32 award will be effective new treatments for
childhood cancers."
10926941,"CORE 2 ABSTRACT
In this renewal, all three projects share an integrated, synergistic focus on GI GVHD. Core 2 has
developed new services related to GI GVHD in both clinical and experimental BMT in order to meet this
focus of all three projects. The core continues to maintain and curate the MAGIC biorepository (objective
1). During this cycle we collected and processed more than 30,000 research samples from 3000 patients.
Samples are aliquoted into barcoded tubes that are linked to the patient, date and sample type. The core
also continues to provide central analysis for both human and mouse biomarkers (objective 3). We have
developed rigorous quality control processes for real time screening of patient samples for clinical trial
eligibility and reporting of results to all participating sites within 24 hours.
The first new service provided by this core (objective 2) is the use of computer programming to enhance
the flexibility of the MAGIC biorepository and database. This programming reduces data errors and
facilitates rapid creation of contemporaneous controls for single arm clinical trials. The second new
service (objective 4) establishes and analyzes gastrointestinal organoid cultures. These cultures permit
the analysis and quantification of intestinal stem cells in models of GVHD damage in vitro that permit
evaluation of key survival and apoptotic pathways.
The objectives therefore are:
1. To maintain and curate the MAGIC biorepository.
2. To use computer programming to enhance the flexibility of the MAGIC biorepository and facilitate its
 linkage to the clinical database.
3. To provide central analyses of both human and mouse biomarkers.
4. To provide a central process for the establishment and analysis of GI organoids."
10921191,"Significance: As a biologically relevant miniaturized model system for human tissues, 3D organoids offer
a powerful new platform for high-throughput biomedical research, including for the discovery of novel
cancer treatment regiments. While microscopy plays a vital role in organoid experimentation, current
imaging systems are inefficient at capturing their 3D morphology in large numbers, which is required by
a wide variety of high-throughput experiments. In addition, current microscopes are unable to record 3D
video of dynamics, such as cell viability, cell migration, and processes that can reveal mechanistic
properties like diffusion, permeability, and organoid compaction, across more than just a few samples in
an effective manner – resulting in experimental challenges across a wide variety of contexts.
Proposal: Ramona Optics aims to develop a new computational microscope platform (MCAM-96) for
parallelized high-content 3D imaging of volumetric specimens, such as 3D tumor organoid models, at
50X faster speeds than current devices across entire well plates. The MCAM-96 will also record
parallelized live-cell videos assays that probe novel mechanistic and dynamic processes. Jointly
developed open-source image analysis software will rapidly compute temporally aligned statistics of
organoid morphology as a function of time. We will benchmark system performance in a series of novel
live organoid imaging experiments at two sub-award labs in preparation for our first market-ready product.
 SA1: MCAM-96 hardware and software development and verification: Ramona Optics will
produce new parallelized microscope hardware to simultaneously image 96 full wells (8x12 array) with 2
fluorescence channels at 0.3 µm and 4 µm half-pitch lateral and axial resolution, across a 100 µm axial
range in 10-45 sec. Parallelized software will register and calibrate all 96 3D scans for database upload
in 15 sec. We will benchmark system performance against a matching step-and-scan microscope with
10 unique 96 well plates containing a variety of fluorescently labeled 3D tumor organoids.
 SA2: Measuring the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in liver organoids: We will first
develop software to crop individual organoids, project 3D imagery to 2D in-focus composites, and
subsequently extract 100 key morphological features per organoid per scan. With the Rajagopalan Lab
at Virginia Tech, we will then test our new system workflow in a cell viability assay that longitudinally
monitors the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy (3x drugs) on 3D liver organoids with tumor cells.
 SA3: Tracking tumor organoid toxicity and cell migration during immunotherapy: With the
Soker Lab at Wake Forest, we will enhance the MCAM-96 with a parallelized tilted light sheet array for
optical sectioned 3D capture, before completing a series of experiments that record 96X parallelized time-
lapse videos of T cells co-cultured with tumor organoids during variable-dose immunotherapy treatment."
10921361,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are dramatically climbing in adolescents, who are infected
during a time of critical brain development characterized by significant myelination. Adolescents may therefore
be particularly vulnerable to the white matter pathologies closely linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive
disorders (HAND), which affect 30-50% of people living with HIV. Understanding the mechanisms resulting in
HIV-related white matter deficits will be key in the development of therapies to promote myelin integrity and
repair, which may greatly improve neurological function. One important factor predictive of both cognitive decline
in HIV and a lack of myelin is altered brain lipid metabolism. Myelin is highly enriched in cholesterol and lipids,
and both oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing glial cells of the central nervous system, and astrocytes must
synthesize large quantities of cholesterol and lipids for successful myelination to occur. Based on published and
preliminary data, I hypothesize that glial lipid biosynthesis and transport essential for adolescent
myelination are dysregulated by HIV or DTG/TDF/FTC antiretroviral therapy (ART), making lipid metabolism
a potential therapeutic target for improving white matter integrity in adolescents living with HIV. To address this
hypothesis, I will determine how HIV and ART affect 1) oligodendroglial lipid metabolism and resulting myelin
lipid composition and adolescent myelination, and 2) astroglial lipid metabolism and release and its impact on
myelin formation. Successful completion of the proposed aims will reveal whether HIV or ART affect lipid
metabolism in either oligodendrocytes and/or astrocytes and whether this is detrimental to adolescent
myelination. Results from the proposed studies will directly advance the mission of the NIMH by
transforming our understanding of mechanisms of white matter pathology in adolescent HIV/HAND,
revealing potential therapeutic targets for prevention of and recovery from HIV-related neuropathology."
10918900,"Project Summary
 Substance use disorders (SUD) are both a cause and a consequence of housing instability for more
than 30% of people and 60% of people experiencing housing instability report a history of SUD. Improving
housing stability for people with SUD requires evidence-based support to improve retention in permanent
supportive housing (PSH). Despite the need for additional support, housing staff are often under-resourced to
provide the intensive care needed for housing residents. As a result, residents often do not have the skills to
integrate into a new housing context and property owners create and uphold untenable requirements for lease
which together lead to lease violations and a return to housing instability. Technology offers a relative
advantage to staff delivery in the context of workforce shortages and capacity challenges to facilitate person-
centric, standardized, evidence-based support to residents with SUD. The proposed research seeks to address
the need for support for people with SUD in housing communities, with a focus on harm reduction principles
and enhancing access to evidence-based strategies including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) informed
skills and contingency management (CM) to improve individual stability. Voice-based assistants delivered by
smart speakers (e.g., Amazon Alexa and Echo) offer an accessible format for teaching skills and incentivizing
engagement. The primary goal of the proposed solution is to augment the support accessible to people with
SUD in housing communities to improve resident stability. We plan to accomplish this goal by using smart
speakers to teach residents how to apply harm reduction principles through CBT informed skills to real world
challenges. Additionally, we will incentivize participation through CM and provide staff resources to support
intervention uptake. We will demonstrate feasibility through a proof-of concept prototype. Our specific aims are
(1) Collaborate with community partners in housing communities to understand determinants of
intervention implementation through a community-based participatory research approach, leveraging the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. This formative work will include developing a
collaborative board of housing staff and people with lived/living experience to iteratively co-design the product
and identify approaches to implementation. (2) Create content for residents as an application prototype.
The content will include two weeks of smart speaker-delivered educational content for residents on CBT skills
and its application to tasks of daily living. It will also include a subset of educational modules for housing
program staff to feel confident in sharing the program with residents and help them to understand program
data to better support residents. (3) Evaluate the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of
the application prototype by assessing 25 residents on acceptability, usability, and knowledge gain. We will
also assess usability of an existing harm reduction education intervention for staff to prepare for Phase II
adaptation."
10920105,"Summary
RNA is the central biomolecule of life, as it connects the sequence of DNA to the production of
proteins, and serves as a structural building block for critical components within the cell. Despite
the importance of detecting, quantifying and sequencing RNAs in order to exploit their roles in
biology and medicine, the field of RNA research remains limited by the tools available for
monitoring and manipulating RNA. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase (RT) is the most
foundational tool for converting RNA into cDNA, enabling sensitive detection and RNA
sequencing. However, existing, commercially available RTs have significant deficencies that
limit our ability to fully exploit them as engines for analysis and sequencing. This problem has
now been solved with the discovery of powerful new ultraprocessive RTs, MarathonRT (MRT)
and ultraMarathonRT (uMRT). Discovered by the Pyle Lab at Yale University, MRT is an
exceptionally processive RT that copies kilobase-length RNAs (such as the 30kb coronavirus
genome) in a single pass without inhibition by secondary structures or repeats within an RNA
template. Unlike other RTs, performance is maintained at ambient temperatures, which
eliminates RNA degradation and enables reagent kits that can be deployed without refrigeration.
For commercialization, the high-performance version, uMRT, will be developed, optimized and
incorporated into a suite of commercial products for mass distribution. This SBIR grant is
intended to fund the work necessary to create, develop, test and optimize these uMRT products
for the most common RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and sequencing applications. This grant will translate
an innovative scientific discovery into full-fledged commercial products that will significantly
improve research and clinical practice, underscoring the economic power of superior enzymatic
‘hardware.’
We will produce a family of products that boosts the sensitivity of RT-PCR and RNA sequencing
by employing a powerful new generation of reverse-transcriptase (RT) enzymes. History has
shown that innovation typically follows the creation of more powerful scientific tools, such as the
creation of the commercial biotechnology industry that followed the development of recombinant
DNA technology in the 1970s, or the emerging field of gene editing therapeutics following the
discovery of CRISPR enzymes. The introduction of uMRT products is a similar watershed
moment as the scientific community will, for the first time, be able to read and detect variation
within whole transcriptomes, revealing previously ‘invisible’ information that is critical for
understanding all layers of biological function, from patients to single cells."
10920240,"Background & Significance: Each year, out of 4 million pregnancies in North America, approximately 800,000
are classified as high risk. A striking 20% of these pregnancies develop critical perinatal disorders. The notable
gap in early-stage diagnostic tools underscores a pressing need in perinatal medicine.
Objective & Innovation: We propose a pioneering approach to delineate the clinical relevance of placental
biomarkers, detectable in the cervical canal during the first trimester. Utilizing these biomarkers, we aim to offer
clinicians a cutting-edge diagnostic solution, paving the way for earlier interventions and enhancing the negative
predictive value of current measures.
Approach:
 · Milestone 1: Systematic collection and archival of cervical and blood specimens from 200 high-risk
pregnancies between 10-12 weeks of gestation. Specialized collection kits ensure efficiency, while
informed consent facilitates a secure and comprehensive data collation.
· Milestone 2: Quantitative assessment of biomarker concentrations by ELISA in archived samples.
Targeting five pivotal placenta proteins, we aim to highlight those indicative of pregnancies prone to fetal
growth restriction, miscarriage, or preeclampsia.
· Milestone 3: Establish rigorous correlations between cervical specimen biomarker levels and clinical
outcomes. Advanced regression analysis will determine the relationship between biomarkers and
birthweight. Comprehensive digital records on perinatal pathologies will support correlation analyses,
ROC evaluations, and model-fitting techniques. Projections indicate approximately 18% (or 25) of this
high-risk cohort will experience perinatal complications—evident distinctly in cervical biomarker levels.
Team & Commercialization: Led by a distinguished team with a track record of groundbreaking research in
reproductive health, and supported by experts in clinical perinatology, biomarker detection and data analysis, we
are uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge. Our clear roadmap includes patenting all IP and aspires to launch
a diagnostic kit that will benefit the vast number of high-risk pregnancies, initially with potential for a point-of-care
solution in the clinic and subsequently at home, signaling strong commercial promise.
Feasibility & Impact: With pilot data and a structured methodology, the proposed study is on track to validate
the diagnostic platform, laying groundwork for a more comprehensive Phase II clinical utility validation study.
Early identification of at-risk patients promises a significant reduction in adverse outcomes, offering immense
benefits to both mothers and infants and generating considerable healthcare savings.
Conclusion: Merging in-depth research with tangible clinical benefits, our initiative represents a transformative
shift in early-stage perinatal intervention, with vast implications for a significant portion of pregnancies."
10918786,"Babesia microti is a parasite that is transmitted by the same species of ticks that transmit Lyme disease. It is
the causative agent of babesiosis, a disease with a wide array of clinical presentations that can range from an
asymptomatic carrier state in some otherwise healthy individuals to causing fatal infection in others. Most
cases of severe disease that result in hospitalization occur in individuals with underlying health issues such as
immune suppression and lack of a spleen. However, individuals of greater than 50 years of age are also at risk
factor for severe infection, and severe infections have been seen in younger individuals as the disease
becomes more prevalent. It is clear that not all of the factors that predispose someone to severe infection are
known. As with all tick transmitted diseases, the incidence and geographical distribution of babesiosis has
been increasing steadily over the past 20 years. B. microti can also be spread from mother to child during birth,
and to transfusion recipients through transfusion with infected blood. It is one of the most common causes of
transfusion transmitted infections reported to the FDA in the US. It is also a common co-infection with Lyme
disease, and the impact of coinfection on the course of babesiosis and Lyme disease is currently unknown.
Unlike anaplasmosis, another common coinfection with Lyme disease, the therapies used to treat Lyme
disease will not impact babesiosis, and vice versa. Accurate diagnosis is necessary for appropriate therapy to
be applied for each infection. As with most infectious diseases, early treatment can prevent the progression to
severe disease. There are currently no rapid diagnostic assays available for babesiosis. As it is transmitted by
the same ticks as Lyme disease, and is a common coinfection, we propose the development of a point of care
assay capable of supporting the diagnosis of both Lyme disease and babesiosis. We have previously
developed a point of care, multiplex, vertical flow serodiagnostic assay for Lyme disease that has the same
sensitivity and specificity of the currently used central lab two-tier testing paradigm, but can be performed in 15
minutes at the site of patient care. In the current proposal, we will add an antigen capture assay to this platform
to directly detect B. microti simultaneously with serodiagnosis of Lyme disease at the point of care. This
antigen capture assay will provide direct proof of B. microti infection, while the serodiagnostic arm will provide
support for the clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease. For this we propose two aims, 1) Derive high affinity
monoclonal antibodies to serve as capture-reporters for Babesia microti secreted antigen 1, and 2)
Development of a combined vertical flow assay for Lyme disease serology and Babesia antigen detection. This
assay will fill a critical unmet need for rapid assays to support the diagnosis of tick-transmitted diseases at the
point-of-care and improve patient outcomes through earlier antimicrobial interventions."
10918836,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately 10% of the US population, with
prevalence increasing with age (e.g., 3% between ages 65–74 to 32% for people over the age of 85). The US
Department of Veterans Affairs has placed a high priority on clinical research on ADRD, in part, because over
half of the veterans it serves are now over 65 years of age. In the past decade, considerable progress has
been made in the identification of cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography biomarkers of
Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) that are now used to aid in clinical diagnosis. However,
the high cost and invasiveness of these procedures has motivated the search for inexpensive, minimally
invasive, and objective blood-based biomarkers of ADRD that can be used for diagnosis, prognostic
evaluation, tracking treatment response, and monitoring disease progression. Using blood-based DNA
methylation data from VA’s Million Veteran Program (MPV), this study will examine the epigenetic contributions
to ADRD risk with the aim of identifying DNA methylation loci that may eventually be used to guide the
development of blood-based methylation assays for use with patients at risk for, or diagnosed with, ADRD.
To do so, we will examine cross-sectional differences between ADRD cases and controls in blood-based DNA
methylation and use retrospective survival analyses to find DNA methylation markers that predict time to
ADRD diagnosis during the 10+ year MVP observation window. We will evaluate the DNA methylation
correlates of known AD genetic risk factors to identify epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the association
between genetic risk for ADRD and the manifestation of these conditions. We also propose to extend our
previous research on the risk that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) confers for ADRD by examining the
influence of PTSD-associated DNA methylation changes on the development of ADRD. Finally, ADRD is
approximately twice as prevalent in Black Americans of African Ancestry compared to of White non-Hispanic
individuals of European ancestry and the reasons for this disparity remain poorly understood. Compounding
this problem is the fact that individuals of African Ancestry have been vastly underrepresented in genetic and
epigenetic studies of ADRD conducted to date. The cohort of MVP participants with genomewide genotypes
and DNA methylation data is substantially enriched for representation of Black veterans (22%) . This offers an
unprecedented opportunity to examine racial/ancestral epigenetic differences and advance understanding of
the biology underlying racial disparities in risk for ADRD."
10927214,"ABSTRACT (Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core)
The growing availability of large-scale, high-dimensional molecular information and clinical research data, as
well as sophisticated statistical methodologies for analyzing these complex data, provides unprecedented
opportunity to advance clinical and translational research of cardiometabolic disease. However, extensive
study design, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computational expertise is needed to appropriately incorporate
these cutting-edge advancements into biomedical research. As part of the proposed Centers for Biomedical
Research Excellence (COBRE) Phase 2 grant, we will establish a new Bioinformatics and Biostatistics
Core (BBC) that will serve as a hub for study design, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computational support.
The overall objectives of the BBC are: 1.) To expand study design, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and
computational resources, capacity, and support in the COBRE program through the establishment of a
dedicated analytic and computational infrastructure; and 2.) To train and assist research project leaders
(RPLs), pilot project leaders (PPLs), other COBRE investigators, and collaborators in the application of
sophisticated bioinformatics and biostatistics approaches that promote high-quality research. To achieve these
objectives, the BBC will provide RPLs, PPLs, other COBRE investigators, and collaborators with the support in
study design, bioinformatics, and biostatistics that is needed to conduct high-quality clinical and translational
research of cardiometabolic disease (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will leverage our expertise in bioinformatics and
biostatistics to develop and implement novel tools and methods that are tailored to Research Projects of RPLs,
PPLs, other COBRE investigators, and collaborators and may be adapted and adopted by the Tulane scientific
community. As part of Aim 2, the BBC will provide training opportunities to RPLs, PPLs, other COBRE
investigators, and collaborators seeking to broaden and enhance their clinical and translational research skills.
Our proposed workshops and one-on-one mentorship opportunities will build bioinformatics, biostatistics, and
computational research skills, empowering COBRE investigators and collaborators to independently conduct
rigorous clinical and translational research in cardiometabolic disease. To ensure continued visibility and
utilization of the BBC beyond the COBRE funding period, we will also establish a self-sustaining BBC that will
serve as a long-term resource for the Tulane University scientific community (Aim 3). Our self-sustaining core
facility will be supported by NIH-funded research studies, as well as fee-based services for non-COBRE
investigators. In total, the BBC is a critical component of the COBRE Phase 2 program, which will be
extensively utilized by all four proposed COBRE Research and Pilot Projects. The BBC will provide Tulane
investigators with the supports necessary to accelerate scientific discovery and translate those discoveries to
public health practice and clinical care in cardiometabolic disease."
10927216,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Molecular Detection and Diagnostics Core)
The Tulane COBRE for Clinical and Translational Research in Cardiometabolic Diseases Phase 2 application
aims to further develop and strengthen the clinical and translational research infrastructure at Tulane University
and to continuously expand and support a critical mass of investigators with expertise in clinical and translational
research in cardiometabolic diseases. The newly proposed Molecular Detection and Diagnostics Core (MDDC)
will support the Research Project Leaders (RPLs), Pilot Project Leaders (PPLs), other COBRE investigators and
collaborators at Tulane University by providing cutting-edge instruments, innovative technologies and
methodologies, and expertise in multidisciplinary research including biochemistry, biomedical engineering,
analytical chemistry, proteomics, nanotechnology, and mass spectrometry (MS) to advance their clinical and
translational research in the etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiometabolic disease. The
MDDC will develop and adapt integrated nanotechnology-based strategies and other innovative technologies to
identify novel biomarkers for early disease detection, prognostic evaluation, and the real-time monitoring of
treatment responses as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms of cardiometabolic disease. The MDDC
seeks to catalyze research that spans the analytical chemistry-biology interface, empowering investigators to
identify and solve important interdisciplinary research questions in the clinical and translational sciences of
cardiometabolic disease. Based on our team's expertise, the MDDC will provide COBRE investigators with
training and services in state-of-the-art analytical technologies such as MS and microarray-based proteomics
and organ-on-a-chip, among others, for the analysis of complex proteomes of tissue and biofluid samples. The
MDDC will also identify appropriate existing analytical methods as well as adapt newly developed methods, often
not available in the form of mature technologies. The MDDC will be housed within the Tulane University Center
for Cellular and Molecular Diagnostics, which has been well established for infectious and chronic disease
research. During the COBRE Phase 2, the MDDC will provide cutting-edge instruments and methodological
support for RPLs of Projects 2 and 3 to conduct their individual research projects. In addition, the MDDC will
provide expert consultation and state-of-the-art technologies for RPLs of Projects 1 and 4 to develop R01
applications to further investigate molecular mechanism of APOL1 on chronic kidney disease progression and
potassium intake on blood pressure reduction. The proposed MDDC will enhance the interactions and
collaborations among COBRE, non-COBRE and external investigators involved in molecular studies of
cardiometabolic disease. Since the MDDC is a critical component of the COBRE program, our long-term goal is
to grow MDDC into a sustainable resource that serves all phases of translational research, from basic science
to clinical science to population science at Tulane University by providing a broad range of state-of-the-art cellular
and molecular analytical services."

10928723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The optimal management of patients with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE), who have right heart
dysfunction but a normal blood pressure, is uncertain. These patients are at risk for poor short-term outcomes,
suffer from reduced functional capacity, and have lower quality of life over the long term. While systemic
thrombolysis reduces clinical deterioration from PE, this benefit is offset by substantial increases in major and
intracranial bleeding. Catheter-directed therapy (CDT), which dissolves pulmonary artery thrombus with a
much lower dose of thrombolytic drug, may be as effective as systemic thrombolytic therapy without
substantially increasing bleeding, but it has risks and is costly, and it is not known if it improves
cardiopulmonary heath, particularly over the long term.
We therefore plan to conduct an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomized trial, the Pulmonary Embolism:
Thrombus Removal with Catheter-Directed Therapy (PE-TRACT) Study, to compare CDT with No-CDT in
up to 500 patients with submassive PE. The trial is adaptive, and could result in enrollment being stopped
early for superior efficacy or for futility at an interim analysis. There will be two primary efficacy outcomes: peak
oxygen consumption at 3 months (short-term) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at 12 months
(long-term), analyzed sequentially using a gatekeeping approach; for NYHA class to be compared, peak
oxygen consumption must first be shown to be increased by CDT (P<0.05). The primary safety outcome will be
major bleeding within 30 days of randomization. The Data Coordinating Center, led by experts with deep
experience in adaptive and pragmatic clinical trial design and implementation, will oversee all aspects of study
design, implementation, and analysis, and will provide state-of-the-art data collection and quality control
infrastructure, reporting to the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and provision of data and
resources to the public. The PE-TRACT Study will change clinical practice: if CDT is effective and safe, it will
become part of standard therapy for patients with submassive PE; if not, a risky and costly therapy will be
avoided. Hence, either study outcome will improve public health and advance the NHLBI’s mission"
10924717,"Unhealthy alcohol use is very prevalent (22-30%) among persons with HIV (PWH), impairs adherence to
antiretroviral therapy (ART), and fuels inflammation, HIV non-suppression, coinfections (e.g., tuberculosis), and
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) that are common among PWH. There is an urgent need to reduce
unhealthy alcohol use, especially in Uganda which has high prevalence of HIV, unhealthy alcohol use, and HIV
comorbidities. Brief (up to 4 hours) alcohol-focused interventions (BI) can reduce alcohol use in PWH, but their
effect sizes have been modest. This is also true for screening and brief (5-15 minutes) interventions (SBI) that
are being rolled out within HIV clinics in Uganda. BIs rely on self-reported alcohol consumption for assessment,
personalized feedback, goal setting and monitoring, which are key for readiness and motivation for behavior
change, but may be limited by impaired self-awareness and under-reporting. We hypothesize that alcohol
biomarker testing and results communication, with a biomarker such as phosphatidylethanol (PEth), can
improve the efficacy of BIs by increasing readiness and motivation for change via increased self-awareness
and improved personalized feedback based on an objective measure, and by objectively measured goal
setting and monitoring, similar to targeting a HbA1c level in diabetes, viral suppression in HIV, or tenofovir
adherence in ART and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis via recently developed urine testing. PEth is correlated
with total prior month alcohol consumption and is sensitive and specific for unhealthy alcohol use; a low-cost
PEth immunoassay is being validated, and a point-of-care test will likely soon follow. We propose the
Phosphatidylethanol Results Communication (PERC) Study, that builds on our long-standing US/Uganda
collaboration in alcohol/HIV research. Our long-term goal is to determine whether PEth can be used to boost
the efficacy of alcohol BIs. Our short-term goal for this R34 is to develop the strategies to provide PEth results
in BIs, and examine their acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, before proceeding to a larger trial. Aim
1 is to elicit input via a series of focus group discussions (FGDs) including theater testing and role playing, with
several groups of stakeholders (patients, clinic staff, community, and government), and conduct field testing
and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with PWH who engage in unhealthy alcohol use. Aim 2a is to conduct a pilot
randomized controlled (RCT) trial (n=80), with PWH who engage in unhealthy alcohol use randomized to
receive either PEth-boosted BI or the standard BI that is being rolled out in HIV care in Uganda. Our primary
measures will be acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention, measured quantitatively and
qualitatively. We will explore changes in readiness for alcohol reduction and changes in PEth at three months,
by study arm. Lastly, we will share these results in FGDs with the stakeholders from Aim 1, and elicit input on
whether we should proceed to a full-scale trial. This work is relevant for a broad range of alcohol BIs for PWH
and others, and for other behavioral interventions that might benefit from new point-of-care testing."
10921920,"The long-term objective of this research program is to greatly increase the availability of large DNA constructs
for biomedical researchers, by providing a new, highly automated, and low-cost way of making long synthetic
DNA molecules. Gene-length DNA is routinely used by genetic engineers to deliver narrow functionalities into
engineered cells. Long DNA—which may comprise 10’s, 100’s or even 1000’s of genes—can deliver far more
complex functionality into cells, such as installing entire chemical synthetic pathways into bacteria to produce
valuable drugs, or delivering larger recognition and killing payloads into immune cells being programmed to
target cancer cells, or having far more viruses and strains represented in mRNA vaccines, which are normally
single gene-based. For optimal scaling and economics, these future long DNA assembly chips would be the
same type of chip that are mass produced for processors, memory, imaging, and communications, so-called
“CMOS chips”. The scaling properties of such chips have been transformative for the industries they touch and
can do the same for production of designer long DNA. CMOS chip devices offer the greatest potential for
miniaturization, precision automation, and low-cost deployment, far beyond what is possible with the robotic
automation that is currently used in industrial biofoundries that make custom DNA. The specific approach that
enables the construction of long DNA in a way that will map ideally onto future electronic CMOS chips is to use
all-electronic control of DNA motion within nanoscale channels, to route around and join the small building block
pieces of DNA. Towards this goal, one Aim of this project is to develop precision motion control for DNA
fragments moving in the channels. The other Aim is to use this motion control to bring together and join distinct
DNA fragments. The methods of this project will consist of fabricating discrete electronic nanochannel devices
and using these to explore all relevant motion control parameters. Issues of biocompatibility and biofouling of
will also be considered, in the context supporting the desired DNA assembly workflow. The findings from this
project will directly enable the next phase to fabricate a CMOS chip device, towards the ultimate goal of
dramatically increasing access to long DNA for more powerful genetic engineering in biomedical applications."
10924036,"Urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms (UI/LUTS) are a major healthcare burden. Unfortunately, there are large disparities in knowledge, access to treatment and inclusion in research for minority women with UI/LUTS. One important disparity is the lack of access to evidence-based, non-surgical treatment options (e.g., diet and behavioral modification, weight loss and physical therapy (PT)). Minority women often to not have access to safer, conservative interventions due to poor access and insurance coverage. Additionally, UI/LUTS lead to anxiety and depression, which our preliminary studies have shown, exacerbate organic UI/LUTS symptoms. Given the barriers to accessing PT and the behavioral and mental health impacts on UI/LUTS, this project will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-specific, home- based, community health-worker (CHW) supported, conservative intervention for UI/LUTS. The SUPPORT intervention will include self-managed cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), behavioral modifications and self-directed physical therapy exercises. We propose to adapt our clinician-guided CBT for UI/LUTS to a self-managed CBT curriculum supplemented with self-directed PT and behavioral retraining and support from a CHW. Our intervention will test the feasibility, efficacy, adherence and acceptability of an intervention like this is in a large, publicly funded hospital in Chicago. Over 4 years, we aim to 1) write a home CBT and PT handbook that is sensitive to patient culture and health literacy and can be followed by the patient at home over 8 weeks to improve UI/LUTS; 2) to determine the efficacy of this intervention in treating UI/LUTS and the acceptability and adherence to this program of our participants. We hypothesize that SUPPORT therapy will significantly improve UI/LUTS and will be satisfying and feasible for patients to complete."
10918876,"Over 6.5 million US patients suffer from chronic wounds. Even though nearly $50 billion is invested in
treatments annually, approximately 30% of patients will not heal using existing interventions and many
wounds progress to serious infections, with some leading to amputation or death.
Recent studies show over 75% of chronic wounds harbor biofilms, and mounting evidence indicates
these are a critical barrier to successful treatment. Current products used to manage wound bioburden
are not effective against biofilm and they can cause irritation and cytotoxicity that impairs healing. New
therapeutics are needed that are effective against bacteria in biofilms and conducive to healing.
The goal of this project is to develop a new generation of wound treatments based on a novel
antimicrobial peptide formulated in a biocompatible and biodegradable wound management matrix. The
product, called Gatekeeper™, has demonstrated efficacy against biofilms and is significantly more
biocompatible than commonly used silver and chlorhexidine. The easy to apply product forms a
hydrogel that maintains a moist wound healing environment and ensures intimate contact with the
wound bed to effectively kill bacteria and prevent biofilm recurrence. Gatekeeper™’s broad spectrum
activity against biofilms of multidrug resistant bacteria has been demonstrated in vitro, ex vivo and in
both small and large animal models of infected wounds. The lead peptide has been selected, the
formulation has been optimized, and substantial work has been completed that identified key
requirements for production, packaging, and sterilization. The product is stable to end stage sterilization
and has demonstrated 2-year real time stability at room temperature.
The scope of the proposed project covers transition of the current lab scale production to pilot
manufacturing under cGMP, production of cGMP product inventory to support verification and validation
(V&V) testing, completion of V&V testing, including non-clinical safety studies, and assembly of the
product’s design history file and device master record to prepare for an FDA filing for product clearance.
Gatekeeper™ is expected to have a substantial impact on advancing treatment options for chronic
wound patients. It will improve quality of life by reducing infection, odor, pain, and time to healing.
Because the cost of wound care scales with time to wound closure and complications associated with
infection, the proposed product also has potential to reduce treatment costs."
10918938,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
CognifiSense has developed a unique, patented VR therapy for chronic pain, called Virtual Reality Neuroscience-
based Therapy (VRNT). VRNT is specifically designed to create substantial and lasting pain reduction by
targeting the centralized drivers of pain chronification and amplification. Following our highly successful Phase I
study, the goal of this Phase II project is to make the VRNT system market-ready and demonstrate its efficacy
in a pivotal randomized controlled trial (RCT). Phase II data will subsequently be used in an FDA submission.
Chronic pain is a serious medical condition impacting an estimated 1 in 5 Americans. Chronic lower back pain
(cLBP) is the most common type of chronic pain, affecting 27 million Americans. Chronic pain is a complex
biopsychosocial condition with a significant centralized (central nervous system) component, which must be
addressed to yield clinically meaningful, long-lasting reductions in pain. Standard treatments for cLBP yield small
to medium magnitude effect sizes, and many involve risk of significant side-effects and / or addiction.
Pharmacological treatments simply mask effects and do not address any underlying, centralized drivers of pain.
Devices seek to address peripheral or ascending pain signals. The leading psychological therapies aim to
improve primarily behavioral and emotional functioning rather than reduce pain intensity. Numerous clinical trials
have shown that the effects of these treatments on pain intensity are small, and long-term effects are even more
limited. Virtual reality (VR) pain therapies have shown significant promise, but most VR therapies focus on
digitizing traditional psychological therapies or therapies only effective for acute pain.
VRNT takes a unique approach. It uses patented technology that incorporates the latest pain neuroscience and
newer, more effective psychological therapies to provide experiential learning and novel skills training to correct
maladaptive neural processes. In our NIH-funded SBIR Phase I research, we established clinical proof of
concept for VRNT with a small-scale randomized clinical trial of people with cLBP. The trial demonstrated that
VRNT creates clinically meaningful post-treatment improvements in pain. Moreover, we generated brain imaging
data that provided preliminary evidence of neuroplastic changes in the brain that paralleled chronic pain
reduction from VRNT treatment. The current Phase II application will support research to make VRNT market-
ready and provide pivotal data on VRNT’s placebo-controlled effect magnitude and long-term efficacy.
The Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1) Port VRNT to a new VR hardware platform and make minor
modifications to improve usability and engagement. 2) Develop sham VR software using an accepted sham VR
design. 3) Demonstrate VRNT’s clinical efficacy and durability in people with cLBP in a sham-controlled RCT."

 I am an Associate Professor and lung transplant pulmonologist deeply committed to mentoring. I have
developed a well-funded research program focused on applying aging-related research principles to define
factors that impact patient-centered outcomes before and after lung transplant. Relevant to this K24 proposal, I
led multicenter efforts that showed that frailty, sarcopenia, and high adiposity were prevalent and novel risk
factors for disability, poorer health-related quality of life (HRQL), peri-operative complications, and death before
and after transplant. My work has informed international guidelines on lung transplant candidacy, professional
society statements, and NIH funding priorities. I am fortunate to have a diverse pool of resources including NIH
funding; a cross-Departmental UCSF research program in advanced lung disease and transplant that I
founded and direct; an outstanding research environment at UCSF with a large pool of potential mentees; and
a network of collaborators throughout the country that I work closely with as part of multicenter cohort studies I
lead or co-lead. Increasing clinical responsibilities, however, have limited my own career development and my
ability to support a larger pool of mentees, especially those working to transition to independence.
 I have a diverse mentoring committee of seasoned investigators, themselves K24 recipients, who
helped me to develop a tailored mid-career development plan. This plan includes didactics and experiential
trainings in aging and gerontology and with expert collaborators to learn high-dimensional approaches to
analyzing biomarkers and to deepen my experience with advanced and novel causal inference approaches to
analyzing complex, longitudinal datasets. This plan also includes mentorship and leadership training. I will
leverage this training and collaborators on this award to advance my work in in frailty in new directions. We will
investigate our newly described molecular subphenotypes of frailty. To do so, we will leverage participants,
data, and research infrastructures of multicenter R01 and two U01s that I am PI/MPI on and add discrete new
measures. With this K24, we will examine the heterogenous pathobiology of pre- and incident post-operative
frailty and determine whether this heterogeneity confers differential risk for pre-, peri- and post-operative
complications in lung transplant including in older adults. The new research directions proposed and career
development will make my program attractive to a diverse pool of mentees including those training in geriatrics,
surgery, other solid-organ transplant fields, nursing, and those interested in interventions and health services.
My areas of research expertise are unique in transplant. With my existing funding and support of this K24, I am
well-positioned and committed to supporting trainees to develop fulfilling and sustainable research careers."

activities of the synergistic research ACPC projects with scientific and technical expertise and resources in the
areas of therapy resistance, signaling, metabolism, pancreatic cancer biology, organoid and mouse models,
immune and non-immune stroma, and PDAC tissues for studying the acquired therapy resistance in cancer. The
core leadership will provide expertise spanning the basic to translational spectrum, consistent with the
overarching theme of ACPC, with track records of building and guiding large scientific teams to successfully

10926943,"Project Summary Abstract
All projects in this ARTNet application will use deidentified human specimens for research directed at
understanding acquired resistance to therapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In order to provide the
necessary specimens, a Tissue Core has been developed in cooperation with and under the auspices of the
University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) Tissue Bank, with the goal of providing a coordinated and
centralized core dedicated to procuring, processing and distributing biological specimens and associated de-
identified clinical data. The Rapid Autopsy Program (RAP) core facility stores normal, benign (i.e. acute
and/or chronic fibrosing pancreatitis) and malignant pancreatic tissues (including both primary and metastatic
pancreatic carcinomas as well as neuroendocrine tumors) and peripheral blood lymphocytes, plasma and
serum from patients undergoing surgical procedures for pancreatic malignancies and from deceased
patients with a history of pancreatic cancer (rapid autopsy). Non-cancer donor whole pancreata, spleen,
duodenum, liver, lung, muscle, lymph node and adrenal tissue are also collected in collaboration with local
organ procurement agencies. The RAP biorepository also coordinates with surgery and oncology, as well as
several well-established UNMC patient monitoring programs, such as the PCDC and PCCR, to develop
robust longitudinal collections of pre, early, and end-stage tissue and biofluid sample sets. Importantly, the
currently archived samples available from the rapid autopsy program are a UNMC-based resource
representing the exact sample sets necessary to investigate acquired resistance in PDAC disease and
continued growth of the resource will only serve to enhance UNMC’s ability to study disease resistance. The
core also maintains a cache of various resources available to all cancer investigators, such as disease and
normal TMAs, donor sample sequence analysis and fresh tissue acquisition. The bank includes a
mechanism for database management and specimen distribution (Freezerworks) and a uniform system of
prioritization of requested materials has been defined and used by the Tissue Bank Oversight Committee.
This core facility is intended to benefit the specific research activities of the ARTNet, as well as the research
activities of other scientists within and outside of UNMC who are concentrating on translational research
issues and resistance mechanisms.
Only specimens obtained from clinically indicated surgeries after all other diagnostic procedures have
been performed will be submitted to the UNMC ARTNet tissue bank for resistance research. The
specimens would otherwise be discarded or disposed. Eligible patients have the opportunity to participate
by submitting written informed consent. There is no risk to the patient or compromise to the patient's care,
as all the procedures performed would be performed for diagnostics regardless of the collection need.

10926945,"ABSTRACT: The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) and its Protocol Review 
and Monitoring System (PRMS) hold authority, responsibility, and centralized oversight over all institutional 
cancer clinical trials (screening, diagnosis, prevention, behavioral, treatment) at UNM and within our collaborative 
statewide cancer clinical trials network with community health systems (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance, 
NMCCA). PRMS led by Teresa Rutledge, MD (CT), assures that all cancer clinical trial protocols are: 1) of the 
highest scientific merit; 2) have appropriate scientific rationale, study design, expected accrual rates, 
biostatistical considerations, data safety and monitoring plans based on study risk, and reasonable timelines to 
achieve anticipated accrual; and 3) address the unique cancer disparities and needs of our catchment area. 
PRMS functions are accomplished by a rigorous two-stage review process based on specific criteria and 
authorities to initiate, monitor, and terminate cancer trials based on fit and relevance, utilization of center 
resources, and scientific progress. PRMS functions include: 1) initial evaluation of clinical trials by UNMCCC 
disease-specific Clinical Working Groups (CWGs) for scientific merit, relevance to the catchment area, and 
prioritization within the existing clinical trial portfolio; and 2) conducting authoritative scientific evaluation, 
including peer review of scientific merit and continuous monitoring of accrual and scientific progress. NIH and 
UNMCCC-funded investigator-initiated trials derived from UNMCCC science and NCI National Clinical Trials 
Network (NCTN) trials addressing cancer disparities are the highest priority of the UNMCCC and NMCCA

the prioritization of clinical trials that meet the needs of our highly diverse catchment area characterized by 
striking cancer health disparities and unique patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. The UNMCCC clinical 
research enterprise has undergone extensive process improvement and significant reorganization during this 
project period, with streamlined and modernized work flow processes. Only the PRMC has the authority to open 
and to suspend or close cancer-related research studies based on a lack of scientific progress or low accrual. In 
2019, the CWGs vetted 119 studies and forwarded 69 of these studies for review. Eight trials failed in review by 
the operational Feasibility Committee and were withdrawn prior to PRMC review. Fifty-three total studies were 
PRMC approved. PRMC closed 5 trials in 2019 and 4 in Q1 2020. The UNMCCC PRMS review process is a 
critical function to ensure research conducted at UNMCCC is of the highest quality."
10926946,"Project Summary: Early systemic dissemination, extraordinary local invasion, late diagnosis, and inadequate
response to the existing chemotherapy contribute to poor prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) patients. While pancreatic tumors generally show a low intrinsic response to chemotherapies, most
acquire resistance over the course of the treatment. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the
mechanisms contributing to acquired resistance to therapies and to identify novel therapies/therapeutic
combinations that would significantly improve survival in patients. We have demonstrated that metabolic
reprogramming presents a targetable vulnerability for abrogating acquired resistance and improving the therapy
response in PDAC. The therapy resistance depends on both tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms and a metabolic
and signaling crosstalk between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Our unbiased preliminary data with
multiple human PDAC patient-derived xenograft models identified peptidyl arginine deiminase 1 (PADI1) as the
top upregulated gene that correlated significantly with poor patient prognosis. Citrullination or deimination of
arginine residues produces a loss of a positive charge, increasing the mass and the acidity of the amino acid
side chain, and the post-translational modification results in altered protein-protein interactions, signaling, and
transcriptional responses. We noted robust expression of PADI1 in human PDAC tumors and cell lines and a
correlation with patient survival. Inhibiting PADI activity or PADI1 knockdown significantly improved the
responsiveness of PDAC cell lines and organoids to components of FOLFIRINOX therapy. PADI1 expressing
PDAC tumors also demonstrated a significant correlation with the glycolytic phenotype and hypoxia gene
signature, showing a reciprocal relationship with oxidative phosphorylation. We also performed an unbiased
CRISPR screen and identified novel metabolic vulnerabilities that may be efficacious for co-targeting with agents
inhibiting PADI1 downstream metabolic pathways. PADI expression also correlated with the reprogramming of
immune and non-immune stroma in the microenvironment. Hence, the proposed project 1 will test the hypothesis
if targeting PADI1 or downstream metabolic reprogramming will abrogate the development of resistance
to FOLFIRINOX in PDAC. We will also investigate the mechanistic basis of stromal remodeling in PDAC
tumors and the stromal reprogramming that contributes to acquired FOLFIRINOX resistance. We propose
three specific aims to test the hypothesis. Aim 1 will investigate the efficacy of targeting PADI1 downstream
pathways and associated mechanisms of stromal remodeling for abrogating resistance to FOLFIRINOX therapy.
Aim 2 will determine the mechanism of tumor-cell intrinsic metabolic reprogramming that also feeds into stromal
reprogramming by PADI1. Aim 3 will investigate the efficacy of targeting the pathways identified in Aims 1 and 2
in PDX models and determine clinical correlates utilizing human tissue specimens. These studies will provide
novel insights and opportunities to target acquired FOLFIRINOX resistance in PDAC."
10926947,"Abstract. Pancreatic cancer arises as an innately therapy-resistant cancer that is capable of rapidly acquiring
additional resistance to therapy upon treatment. We and others have demonstrated that high levels of expression
of MUC1 contribute to both inherent and acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer (and other lethal cancers) to
therapies. Evidence that MUC1 plays a critical role in resistance to therapy comes from unbiased analysis of
gene expression profiles in different tumors, and results of many experimental knockdown studies, which have
revealed that high levels of MUC1 are associated with resistance to radiation, cisplatin, estrogen receptor targets,
lenalidomide, paclitaxel, tamoxifen, trastuzumab, gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX, etoposide, and other experimental
drugs in numerous cancers including pancreatic, breast, colorectal, gastric, head and neck, hepatocellular, non-
small cell lung cancer, renal cell and multiple types of cancer stem cells. MUC1 is known to affect oncogenic
signaling and transcriptional programs through interactions and effects with signaling effectors and transcription
factors. Our collaboration with Pankaj Singh's group has shown that MUC1 stabilizes and activates HIF-1a and
increases glucose uptake and metabolism, and that upregulation of MUC1 in Gemcitabine resistant cells and
concomitant stabilization of HIF induces anabolic glucose metabolism to impart Gemcitabine resistance to
pancreatic cancer cells. Recent results from our laboratory, presented below, have provided provocative data
showing that: MUC1 is expressed on tumor cell derived exosomes; that MUC1 expressing exosomes from
tumors contain cargoes distinct from exosomes that do not express MUC1; that MUC1 derived exosomes are
selectively taken up by cancer associated fibroblasts, immune cells, other tumor cells and cells that comprise
the premetastatic niche of pancreatic cancer. Additional data show that MUC1 containing exosomes alter the
biological properties of cells that take them up in ways that enhance tumor growth at primary and metastatic
sites, and increase drug resistance of tumors growing at those sites. This leads us to the Overarching
Hypothesis for the studies in this application: Exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells induce resistance
to chemotherapy and immunotherapy by reprogramming metabolic and functional features of tumor
cells, cancer associated fibroblasts and immune cells in the primary tumor and at distant metastatic
sites. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose two aims: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate the molecular features of
MUC1 positive exosomes that cause therapy resistance through reprogramming of tumor cells, cancer
associated fibroblasts, and immune cells at local or metastatic sites.; Specific Aim 2. Evaluate expression
signatures and pathways of therapy resistance in matched sets of primary tumors and metastatic lesions from
untreated and treated patients (from our tissue core) by utilizing spatial transcriptomics (single cell RNAseq) and
by performing multiplexed immunofluorescence."
10926948,"Abstract Text
Many antitubulin agents, such as paclitaxel (Taxol), have been used extensively for treatment of several types
of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Despite their wide use in cancer treatment,
however, patient response is highly variable and drug resistance remains a major clinical issue. It is therefore
essential to identify prognostic markers to predict the patient response and to enhance drug sensitivity.
Through biochemical and cell-based kinome-wide screens, we identified MARK2 (microtubule affinity-
regulating kinase 2) as a critical regulator for Taxol chemosensitivity in PDAC (pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma) cells. We show that MARK2 is phosphorylated in response to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.
We further identified the corresponding kinase and mapped phosphorylation sites. MARK2 determines Taxol
cytotoxicity in PDAC cells without affecting growth under normal conditions. Mechanistically, our findings also
suggest that MARK2 controls Taxol chemosensitivity by regulating class IIa HDACs (histone deacetylase).
MARK2 directly phosphorylates HDAC4 upon Taxol treatment. MARK2-phosphorylated HDAC4 positively
regulates YAP (yes-associated protein) activity and controls expression of YAP target genes specifically
induced by Taxol. Inhibition of HDACs sensitizes PDAC cells to Taxol treatment in vitro and in
immunocompetent animals. Our hypothesis is that the MARK2-HDACs axis functions as a therapeutic target
for overcoming Taxol resistance in PDAC patients. We will test our central hypothesis by three specific aims.
Aim 1: Determine the role and regulation of MARK2 in response to antitubulin chemotherapeutics; Aim 2:
Elucidate the downstream effectors and mechanisms of MARK2 in response to Taxol chemotherapeutics; Aim
3: Targeting HDACs and serine metabolism to overcome Taxol resistance in PDAC. The identification of new
regulators and/or signaling pathways triggered by antitubulin drugs will shed light on the mechanisms
underlying chemoresistance. Our study suggests that combining HDAC inhibitors with antitubulin agents (e.g.
Taxol) will have enhanced efficacy in treatment of drug-resistant and/or recurrent PDAC patients."

10926951,"SUMMARY
Colon adenomas account for 80-85% of the CRC precancerous lesions and can progress to CRC. Yet, the
majority of these early lesions remain in an indolent early state, and only 5-10% are aggressive and progress to
CRC. Although the adenoma progression sequence was initially proposed to be driven mainly by the serial
accumulation of gene mutations and epigenetic alterations in colon epithelial cells, based on increasingly detailed
analyses of the ‘cancer-causing’ alterations that characterize CRC, it has becoming apparent that these same
alterations can also be found in indolent adenomas and even in the histologically normal colon epithelium. These
observations indicate that DNA alterations alone are not sufficient to drive adenoma progression. Emerging
studies indicate that factors that mediate adenoma progression can be derived from histologically normal colon
tissue ‘primed’ to foster adenoma progression into cancer. We hypothesize that the adenoma progression is
driven by both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms and the ‘primed’ colon promotes adenoma
progression by providing a permissive tissue environment. We further hypothesize that the distinct features of
a ‘primed’ colon may be developed as biomarkers to predict the likelihood of adenoma progression to cancer.
AIM 1A: To identify molecular signatures of adenoma progression (‘aggressive’ or ‘indolent’) by performing a
mutli-omics evaluation of a unique collection of adenomas followed longitudinally with defined progression
outcomes; AIM 1B: To determine the ‘aggressiveness’ of adenomas in an independent cohort using the
molecular signature of progression derived from Aim 1A.
AIM 2: To directly determine the distinct features of a ‘primed’ colon that associate with adenoma progression.
(1) increased senescent fibroblast load and associated SASP factor expression; (2) oncogenic immune
microenvironment; (3) increased cancer driver gene mutation burden; (4) altered CRC associated methylome,
and (5) the dysbiotic CRC-associated microbiome state.
AIM 3A: To identify and evaluate DNA methylation-based tissue biomarkers to determine whether they predict
the risk of aggressive adenoma occurrence using a highly precise and sensitive droplet digital PCR method.
AIM 3B: To determine if the cancer driver gene mutation burden in the primed colon associates with aggressive
adenoma occurrence using a high fidelity and ultra-deep sequencing method.
This translational Project 1 will provide an unprecedented high-quality characterization of the early lesion and
the surrounding primed colon that enables its progression. This project aligns with the expertise of the
investigators involved, the access to precious sample biorepositories and the infrastructure provided by the U54
mechanism. The significance findings from Project 1 will be functionally interrogated in Project 2&3 and other
U54 projects, leading to an iterative process to advance our understanding of the adenoma biology and the
development of personalized biomarkers for CRC prevention."
10921628,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Many emerging therapeutic strategies employ macromolecules, like proteins or RNAs, to manipulate
intracellular contents and processes, thus mitigating disease. The success of these therapeutic strategies
requires the ability to safely and efficiently deliver macromolecules into cells within the body, which poses a
significant challenge. To overcome the biological barriers to macromolecular delivery, researchers have
developed various delivery vehicles, such as viral vectors and nanoparticles, that can package and deliver
macromolecular cargos into desired target cells. Recently, cell-derived bioparticles, including virus-like
particles and extracellular vesicles, have emerged as promising delivery vehicles that combine key benefits of
both viral- and nanoparticle-based delivery methods. However, a major challenge associated with these new
methods is their poor manufacturability, which severely limits their prospects for clinical translation.
 The proposed work seeks to unlock the full potential of cell-derived bioparticles for therapeutic
macromolecule delivery by developing new strategies for highly efficient bioparticle production. Initial efforts
will focus on identifying, understanding, and manipulating genes in bioparticle producer cells that influence
bioparticle production efficiency. To determine genes that regulate bioparticle production, we will assess the
effects of thousands of different genetic perturbations on bioparticle production by performing pooled genome-
wide knockdown and activation screens in producer cells. These screens will utilize a unique design in which
sequencing a given bioparticle’s contents will identify the perturbation in the cell that produced that bioparticle.
We will perform separate screens to interrogate (1) the production of virus-like particles that package
ribonucleoprotein cargos and (2) the production of extracellular vesicles that package messenger RNA cargos,
yielding insights into two distinct types of cell-derived bioparticles and two important classes of therapeutically
relevant macromolecular cargos. These results will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of
cell-derived bioparticle formation but also reveal new ways to manipulate producer cells to improve particle
production. In parallel, we will establish a new paradigm for directly transferring therapeutic bioparticles from
producer cells into target cells via cell-to-cell contact, a strategy that has the potential to substantially improve
delivery potency relative to existing methods. This investigation will lay a foundation for potentially
transformative therapeutic approaches in which patient-derived cells are engineered into bioparticle producer
cells and transplanted into the body, where they would subsequently engage desired target cells to deliver
therapeutics via locally released bioparticles. Collectively, these studies will dramatically expand the utility of
cell-derived bioparticles as delivery vehicles for macromolecular therapeutics."

The overall goal of the Human Liver Tissue & Hepatocytes Research Resource (HLTHRR) program is to
provide normal human liver tissue and normal human hepatocytes (HC) and non-parenchymal cells (NPC)
including NPC sub-fractions (Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, and stellate cells) as a
core lab to biomedical researchers across the USA. Primary human hepatocytes (HC) continue to be the most
relevant cellular resource to model liver functions and advance our knowledge of mechanisms underlying
metabolic enzymes, drug discovery, toxicology, viral and alcoholic hepatitis, regeneration capacities, and most
importantly human liver diseases. The NIDDK has funded a research program for over 25 years to isolate and
distribute primary human hepatocytes (HC) and liver tissues for research purposes to academic scientists who
are primarily NIH-funded. The initial program was known as Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System (LTCDS),
and more recently (2022-2024) Human HC Isolation and Distribution (HHID) in Dr. Geller's lab at Pitt with
NIDDK bridge funding as an administrative supplement to our active P30 DK120531 “Pittsburgh Liver
Research Center” (PI-Monga). All human HC isolations have been at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) as the
core lab in the USA, and cells distributed to PIs throughout the country. In this HLTHRR proposal, Dr. Geller's
lab will continue to provide human liver tissues and normal human HC as a core service to NIH-funded
investigators throughout the USA. Also, as part of our HLTHRR proposal, NPC from normal human livers will
be separated into high-purity fractions of Kupffer cells (KC), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC),
cholangiocytes, and stellate cells in Dr. Soto-Gutierrez's Pathology lab at Pitt. We will also develop and deploy
a website to facilitate all aspects of cell and tissue distribution. This will include PI registration, announcements
of tissue and cell availability, submission and tracking of cell requests, confirmation of shipping, quality
feedback, annual summary of HLTHRR progress and related publications. The HLTHRR is a unique and
extraordinary resource for the biomedical research community to accelerate liver translational research with
the potential to hasten breakthrough discoveries."
10919156,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 PGXL Technologies is developing a patented, non-invasive urine-based assay for obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) in children. OSA occurs in up to 3% of children and as much as 10% of the pediatric orthodontic
population. OSA can lead to disturbed sleep, neurobehavioral problems, neurocognitive impairments, and
hypertension in children. Diagnosis is primarily limited to in-clinic sleep studies because patient history and
physical examinations are not adequately able to differentiate OSA from primary snoring (PS), i.e., snoring
without associated sleep apnea or underlying sleep disorder. Polysomnography (PSG) tests are the gold
standard for diagnosis, but they are highly expensive, require an overnight stay in a supervised sleep clinic, are
difficult for children, and do not meet the need for screening OSA. There are several home sleep tests (HSTs)
that have been cleared for use in children that use similar sensors and methods as PSG studies in the home,
but the Academy of Sleep Medicine currently does not recommend the use of HSTs for diagnosis of OSA in
children due to the lack of physician supervision and a lack of sufficient evidence of efficacy. There is an unmet
need for a rapid and sensitive test for OSA that can be used for potential diagnosis, patient monitoring as they
undergo treatment, and screening of broader populations. PGXL Technologies is advancing development of a
urine-based, multiplexed immunoassay for screening children for OSA. The four biomarkers urocortin-3
(UCN3), kallikrein-1, orosomucoid-1, and uromodulin are present in urine and have previously shown high
sensitivity and specificity for detection of OSA in children using ELISA assays. Prior to this project, PGXL has
adapted two of the four biomarkers to the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform, a clinical diagnostic platform
based on a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescent detection approach. PGXL has demonstrated initial
clinically relevant detection for two biomarkers, and acquired a retrospective set of pediatric urine samples that
can be used to determine reference ranges. The goal of this Fast-Track proposal will be to advance
development through initial clinical validation. In Phase I, of this Fast-Track project, PGXL will integrate
immunoassays for the remaining biomarkers and optimize the analytical range for each of the assays in the
UroMarker panel using pediatric urine specimens. In Phase II, PGXL will complete analytical validation
required to meet CLIA requirements and conduct a prospective study to establish clinical cutoffs for an
algorithm that includes all four biomarkers. PGXL will also develop a prototype urine collection kit that can be
used for urine collection at home and mailed to a CLIA lab for analysis. Success with these goals will also
inform a larger multi-site clinical study that is expected in Phase IIb and will support FDA clearance of the test.
These milestones provide a path toward the commercial deployment of a high-throughput, multiplex test for
rapid OSA screening through simple home-based sample collection to improve patient outcomes."
10927218,"Project Summary 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that significantly increases risks for end stage kidney 
disease (ESKD) and premature death. Because CKD is generally progressive and irreversible, molecular 
research to better understand its etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets is critically needed. Recent 
studies identified two common variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) that cause rapid 
kidney function decline and ESKD in Black patients with CKD. However, the mechanisms underlying the higher 
risk conferred by the APOL1 variants are still unknown. In addition, not all individuals with the high risk APOL1 
genotype experience rapid CKD progression. As the molecular endpoint of endogenous and exogenous 
processes, examination of the human metabolome provides an opportunity to discover biological pathways 
linking APOL1 to CKD progression and identify factors that modify the effects of APOL1 on this complex 
phenotype. Despite the promise of metabolomics study, work in this area remains sparse. The overall objective 
of this application is to elucidate molecular mechanisms that mediate and/or modify the association between 
APOL1 risk alleles and CKD progression. We hypothesize that a comprehensive study of metabolites in urinary 
samples of CKD patients will discern biological pathways underlying APOL1-associated CKD progression. Our 
study will leverage baseline 24-hour urine samples, annually measured kidney function, and stringently 
adjudicated CKD events in up to 17 years follow-up among all 1,224 Black participants of the ongoing Chronic 
Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. Untargeted metabolomics profiling using baseline 24-hour urine 
samples will be conducted among these participants and used to identify metabolites altered by APOL1 risk 
alleles (Aim 1). We will then examine the prospective associations of baseline metabolites with CKD 
progression among the Black CRIC participants (Aim 2). To articulate the molecular mechanisms underlying 
APOL1-associated CKD progression, we will assess the mediating and modifying effects of metabolites on this 
association (Aim 3). As exploratory work, we will generate a catalogue of urinary-plasma metabolite 
correlations by leveraging metabolomics data from simultaneously collected urine and plasma samples among 
346 CRIC study participants (Aim 4a). Urinary metabolites identified in Aims 1-3 that have a moderate-to-high 
correlation (in Aim 4a) will be evaluated for replication using plasma metabolomics data among 558 
participants of the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (Aim 4b). The proposed work 
represents the first urinary metabolomics study focusing on APOL1 risk alleles and CKD progression among 
Black patients with CKD. This innovative metabolomics study among a high-risk group is likely to reveal novel 
mechanisms of CKD progression. Our findings may also provide evidence-based targets for the development 
of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and reverse CKD progression."
10927221,"SUMMARY
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are interrelated pathological conditions frequently observed to lead to
cardiovascular complications. Obesity-associated T2D is among the most-costly chronic diseases in the US, and
a major cause of morbidity and mortality. There is a substantial latency period preceding T2D development, and
many nascent T2D cases can be prevented if they are identified prior to tissue damage. Until now, there is still
a lack of reliable clinical assay to identify high-risk individuals before the appearance of T2D clinical symptoms.
Adipose tissue dysfunction is a central driver of T2D and adipose tissue is recently reported to produce
extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can enter into circulation and influence whole-body glucose metabolism and
contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Adipose tissue EVs released during disease progression
represent excellent biomarker candidates for T2D risk prediction compared to traditional soluble adipokines,
since adipose tissue EVs contain bio-active cargoes that act on target organs to promote insulin resistance and
ultimately T2D. Adipose tissue EVs are also likely to be more stable in plasma than traditional soluble protein
biomarkers that may be more likely to be degraded by serum protease activity. The assay that could specifically
capture and quantify these adipose tissue EVs associated with T2D may, therefore, serve to early identify obese
individuals at high risk for T2D before they exhibit any clinical symptoms. The overall objective of this study is to
discover and validate novel EVs-based biomarkers for identifying obese individuals at high risk for the
development of pre-T2D and T2D. In Aim 1, we propose to employ a quantitative proteomic labeling method to
identify EV proteins specifically, or predominantly present in adipose tissue EVs isolated from obese patients
with T2D, preT2D, or without T2D. These EV markers could serve as targets for probes to specifically detect
T2D or preT2D-associated EV levels. To promote translation of EVs into clinical practice, we will utilize Aim 2 to
adapt our innovative Nanoplasmon-enhanced scattering assay to quantify specific adipose tissue EVs
associated with increased T2D risk using probes for EV markers and establish optimal conditions to detect T2D
or preT2D-associated adipose tissue EVs, standardize the assay procedure, and evaluate the analytical
performance of the assay. To more effectively translate adipose tissue EV markers into clinical application, we
will validate the Nanoplasmonic assay for adipose tissue EV detection in plasma to permit early detection of
increased T2D risk to guide therapeutic interventions intended to attenuate disease progression prior to tissue
damage. To this end, Aim 3 proposes to employ the optimized Nanoplasmonic assay to evaluate adipose tissue
EVs on T2D prediction in an obese population from the long-term Bogalusa Heart Study cohort, and establish a
machine learning model to assess the EV markers both individually and in combination over and above a set of
known factors for T2D prediction. I am confident to successfully complete the proposed Aims and develop into
an independent investigator with the support of the COBRE program and guidance from the mentor team."
10927224,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global health issue causing a variety of life-threatening complications. Carbohydrates
are the primary energy source and have substantial effects on blood glucose and insulin secretion. There is
widespread consensus that the quantity and quality of carbohydrates play a pivotal role in controlling glucose
metabolism and determining risks of T2D and impaired glucose metabolism. However, complex associations of
carbohydrates with glucose metabolism may exist, partly attributable to genetic adaptation to starch
(carbohydrate)-rich diets. Salivary and pancreatic amylases (encoded by amylase genes AMY1 and AMY2) are
responsible for carbohydrate/starch digestion. The AMY genes exhibit copy number variations (CNVs), leading
to individual differences in the amount and activity of amylase enzymes. The overarching goal of this project is
to prospectively investigate interrelations between the carbohydrate-digestion determining AMY CNVs, dietary
intakes of carbohydrates and starch (both quantity and quality), and longitudinal changes in glucose metabolism
and risks of incident hyperglycemia and T2D. The Bogalusa Heart Study is an ongoing epidemiological study
among a biracial sample (35% Black and 65% White) of men and women in Bogalusa, Louisiana, a state with
the highest burden of obesity and T2D in the United States. The AMY1-AMY2 CNVs will be measured by a novel
droplet digital PCR approach in 1250 participants of the Bogalusa Heart Study. This project examines
associations of AMY1-AMY2 CNVs with subsequent changes in markers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose,
hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance) and the risks of incident hyperglycemia and T2D over 7-
9 years. This project investigates whether the AMY CNVs influence the outcomes through mediating effects on
plasma enzymatic levels of AMY1 and AMY2. Also, prospective gene-diet interactions analyses will be performed
to test whether dietary intakes of carbohydrate and starch (both quantity and quality) significantly modify the
relations between the AMY CNVs and the outcomes. This project also utilizes circulating metabolomic signatures
covering a broad range of carbohydrate/glucose metabolism pathways and a carbohydrate-intake-related
hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21, as mediators to test whether these biomarkers mediate the relations
between the AMY CNVs and the outcomes. The findings of this project would lead to the identification of new
risk factors for impaired glucose metabolism and T2D and advance the development of novel preventive and
therapeutic strategies. The COBRE support will help the Research Project Leader acquire experience leading a
multidisciplinary research project, publishing high-quality research papers, and obtaining pilot data for applying
for R01 funding and transitioning into a competitive independent investigator."
10927229,"Bone infection, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus, remains the bane of orthopaedic surgery.
Although the incidence of infection following primary total joint replacement (TJR) is low (~1%), reinfection
rates are very high (15-40%), which has led to the orthopaedic paradigm that S. aureus infection of bone is
incurable. Additionally, prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is known to be a non-random event that is largely
determined by patient-specific factors. To address this, we proposed the original Center of Research
Translation on the Osteoimmunology of Bone Infection (CoRTOBI) to test the hypotheses that: 1) there
are reservoirs of S. aureus that are not affected by standard of care treatments, and 2) the patient’s immune
proteome against S. aureus antigens impacts the incidence and outcome of bone infection. Our work on this
has resulted in 33 publications, 6 patented technologies that are being translated to the clinic by industry
partners, and several seminal discoveries that remain the focus of this renewal. These, include: 1) S. aureus
colonization of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) of live bone, 2) novel antibiotic adjuvants that
specifically target these mechanisms that can be 3D-printed into custom spacers, 3) custom multiplex
immunoassays to elucidate the immune proteome of S. aureus, 4) in vivo imaging to quantify “the race for the
surface” of implants in real time, and 5) identification of anti-IsdB responses as susceptible immunity vs. anti-
Gmd responses as protective immunity in mice and patients with culture confirmed S. aureus bone infection.

NIH-funded CTSAs, NIH/NIAMS Program staff, and the greater scientific community. Aim 3. Coordinate cost-
effective access to the Research Cores. Aim 4. Maintain our successful Pilot and Feasibility Project Program
(PFPP) in Bone Infection. Aim 5. Patent new intellectual property and collaborate with industry partners.
And, Aim 6. Provide enrichment opportunities for CoRTOBI investigators, bone infection researchers,
orthopaedic surgeons, and the larger scientific and lay communities. At the conclusion of this renewed P50
CoRTOBI, we will have: 1) elucidated novel mechanisms of S. aureus colonization of bone, 2) identified novel
antibiotic adjuvants, and demonstrate their use in 3D-printing spacers for 1-stage revision, 3) defined the
mechanism of susceptible immune proteome genesis, and develop mRNA nanoparticle vaccines to overcome
it, and 4) generated a comprehensive algorithm to predict infection and clinical outcomes."
10927232,"Abstract
The field of Osteoimmunology was established in 2005 to understand how bone influences immune and
hematopoietic cells, as well as how hematopoietic and immune cells influence bone, in clinical conditions like
osteomyelitis. However, several critical research tools and rigorously validated protocols required to translate
discoveries into clinical diagnostics and interventions for osteomyelitis did not exist at the commencement of
this P50 Center of Research Translation on the Osteoimmunology of Bone Infection (CoRTOBI) 5 years ago.
Thus, we assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with extensive experience in bone pathology,
microbial pathogenesis, immunology, electron microscopy, biophysics, material science & engineering,
infectious disease and orthopaedic surgery, to enable several breakthroughs in the field that serve as the
scientific premise of this renewal application. Despite these major advances, additional assay and technology
development is needed to complete the long-term goals of CoRTOBI. Thus, the renewal goals of the
Osteoimmunology Research Core are to: 1) provide the CoRTOBI investigators with state-of-the-art bone
infection research resources that do not exist elsewhere; and 2) develop novel technologies and assays for
future osteoimmunology research on bone infection. Our approaches to achieve these goals are embodied by
the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will process the samples and perform all of the electron microscopy
(EM) on the infected bone and fabricated nanoporous membranes in Project 1, the mRNA vaccine studies in
Project 2, and external collaborations, using EM methods published during the prior funding period. In Aim 2.1
we will fabricate all of the µSiM-CA devices needed for novel antibiotic drug screening. In Aim 2.2 we will
develop and validate novel µSiM-OLCN devices to assess haptotaxis and durotaxis behaviors of S. aureus in
vitro to elucidate the mechanism of S. aureus invasion and colonization of the OLCN of cortical bone during
chronic osteomyelitis, and in Aim 2.3 the Core will develop surface coatings on the µSiM-CA and µSiM-OLCN
chips to enable hypothesis testing of S. aureus adhesion and rigidity during asymmetric binary fission. In Aim
3.1 we will perform all of Luminex-multiplex assays for immune proteome and cytokine analyses, and In Aim
3.2 we will translate this experimental assay for research into a same-day, high throughput clinical diagnostic
called StaphAIR based on Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry technology that allows for the automated
measurement of anti-S. aureus antibodies in near-real time. The Osteoimmunology Core will also facilitate
emerging technologies and research in the Pilot and Feasibility Project Program (i.e. intravital microscopy to
quantify “the race for the surface” during S. aureus colonization of bone implants; automated tape-collecting
ultra-microtome (ATUMtome)/SEM methods for 3D imaging of infected OLCN; and an extension of StaphAIR).
Importantly, it is also our intent to share our resources with investigators outside of this CoRTOBI, and
transport our research platforms to other institutions with a research focus on bone infections."
10927233,"Staphylococcus aureus is involved in 80% of all musculoskeletal infections (MSKI) costing $17,000–$150,000
per patient. Approximately 50% of these infections are caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
acquired in both hospital and community. With >1.5 million total joint replacements (TJR) performed each
year, the most rigorous prophylaxis and aseptic surgical techniques cannot reduce osteomyelitis (OM) rates
below 0.5%–2%. Treating established MSKI remains extremely challenging, with current rates of recurrent or
persistent infection following revision surgery still as high as 33%. The persistence of S. aureus infection is
attributed to its arsenal of immune evasion and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Despite great efforts to
develop solutions, treatment paradigms have not improved the poor clinical outcomes for OM patients over the
last four decades. However, our CoRTOBI paradigm-shifting discovery of S. aureus colonization of the
osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) of live cortical bone during OM in mice and patients may explain
why previous approaches for treating recurring bone infections have failed, and provide a new therapeutic
strategy for eliminating chronic OM. It also begs important questions about the mechanisms that: 1) enable
spherical S. aureus to deform into submicron-rod shaped bacteria to invade the OLCN, and 2) render
susceptible S. aureus strains refractory to antibiotics after OLCN invasion. Over the past four years we
developed a novel bone infection-on-chip utilizing silicon nanomembrane with submicron (~500 nm) array of
pores to simulate OLCN orifices (µSiM-CA). By targeted deletion of candidate genes, we identified cell wall
transpeptidase proteins, penicillin binding protein 4 (Pbp4), as essential for S. aureus propagation through
submicron channels of the µSiM-CA chips in vitro and then demonstrated that they inhibit OLCN colonization in
vivo. Moreover, we developed and performed a high throughput screening campaign to identify PBP4 inhibitors
(iPBP4). In this renewal, we will first demonstrate the efficacy of PBP4 small molecule inhibitors (iPBP4) in
abrogating the OLCN invasion in mouse models of osteomyelitis. We will then identify targets for OM therapy
based on gene expression changes that affords S. aureus adaptive tolerance to antibiotics in a novel µSiM-
OLCN Chip platform. Finally, we will test the premise that OLCN colonization likely involves many additional
factors other than PBP4, and that other chemical classes of OLCN colonization inhibitors can be identified by
empirically defining the genetic determinants. These potential targets can then be used to identify
corresponding putative therapeutics in a single screening approach. At the completion of this renewal program,
CoRTOBI will have: 1) validated recently discovered iPBP4 candidates and potentially new PBP-independent
hits against OLCN colonization, 2) a molecular genetic understanding of S. aureus refractory response to
antibiotics following OLCN colonization, and 3) translational methods for iPBP4 impregnated 3D-printed
scaffolds in one-stage revision surgery for bone infections."
10927296,"Human genetic studies have greatly accelerated progress in understanding the etiopathogenesis of
Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, six causal genes (SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, and VPS35) and
ninety susceptibility genes/loci (e.g., MAPT, GBA) have been identified for PD, mostly in populations of
European or Asian ancestry. However, these genes explain only a small proportion of PD heritability. Thus,
additional novel genes await discovery, and we believe that the highest likelihood of success is in understudied
populations such as those of from Latin America. To fill in this gap we created the Latin American Research
Consortium on the Genetics of PD (LARGE-PD), a growing collaboration between thirty two institutions in
eleven countries across South America/Caribe (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico and Uruguay). LARGE-PD is the largest PD case-control sample series
in Latin America (3,857 individuals), with a target to include at least 8,000 individuals in by 2021, thus serving
as a unique resource for genetic analysis in this understudied population. As LARGE-PD has progressed,
several multiplex PD families (with three or more affected individuals) have been identified and enrolled. With
the goal of replicating our preliminary findings and identifying novel risk-modifying variants we propose in Aim 1
to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) in an additional 6,000 cases and healthy controls (1:1)
ascertained through LARGE-PD. Our preliminary study in a subset of LARGE-PD (N=1,498) identified 7
interesting novel candidate loci. Genotyping this additional 6,000 individuals (N= 7,498) allows replication of
these findings and quadruples our statistical power to find novel associations. We will also perform the first
trans-ethnic GWAS in collaboration with the largest European consortium. In Aim 2, we will perform Whole-
Genome Sequencing (WGS) in 25 LARGE-PD families negative for mutations in all known PD-genes. Finally,
in Aim 3 we will use all our data to generate and test a Latino specific Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), which will
account for possible additive effects between all associated variants and will help improve PD risk prediction in
this population.
 This project will identify novel PD genes associated with both familial and sporadic forms of PD using an
understudied population, thus improving our knowledge of the etiopatogenesis of the disease and identifying
novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD, not only in Latin America, but also in other countries with a
growing Latino population such as the US. We will also test the validity of current PD risk prediction, based on
European populations, in Latinos and generate a Latino specific risk score using our data. We also believe that
our study and others like it, will reduce existing health disparities by allowing Latinos to be active participants in
clinical trials and novel treatments designed to protect and/or treat individuals with specific genetic variants, the
so called personalized medicine.

10924814,"HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects ~50% of people living with HIV (PWH), and concurrent
opioid use disorder (OUD) can enhance symptoms. Since CNS pathology in HIV associated neurocognitive
disorder (HAND) bears similarities to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other ‘tauopathies’ in which accumulation of
abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau) is considered a critical factor in the development/progression of
cognitive symptoms, it is reasonable to think that pTau may have a role in driving cognitive dysfunction in
HIV/HAND. Compared to AD, cognitive changes in HAND are measured earlier and only ≤5% result in dementia.
While post-mortem studies have documented pTau species within HAND+ and OUD brain tissue, and we see
pTau deposition in animal models of HAND/OUD that exhibit cognitive decline, the question of whether pTau
triggers deficits in neuron function that underlie HAND/OUD is not clear. The studies proposed here will clarify
whether pTau has a causal role. Our preliminary and published work shows that multiple pathologic forms of
pTau are present in specific brain regions of a murine model of HAND, and that pTau levels are increased by 2-
8 wks of concurrent morphine exposure. These findings coincide with cognitive issues and motor dysfunction,
as well as in situ physiological changes in neurons in specific brain regions, including hippocampus. We propose
functional studies to connect these interrelated findings, testing the hypothesis that tau/pTau is a critical driver
of cognitive dysfunction in HAND and the exacerbation by opioids. Studies evaluate (i) CA1 pyramidal cell (PC)
output; (ii) a CA1 microcircuit of interneurons that are vulnerable to Tat and express µ-opioid receptor. Functional
assessments use (i) patch-clamp physiology, and (ii) miniscopes to follow activity of individual neurons for 12
weeks in awake, behaving mice (inscopix.com). Physiological (patch clamp), histological and biochemical
damage are evaluated on tissue from individual behaving mice so that all outcomes can be directly correlated.
While pTau is elevated in several brain regions, we focus on hippocampus, an area critical to normal cognitive
processes which is clearly involved in a multiple conditions of cognitive decline. Two transgenic models of HAND
in virally suppressed PWH that exhibit cognitive dysfunction (inducible CNS expression of HIV Tat; Tg26) are
used to suggest relative contributions of Tat vs other HIV proteins in HAND. Longitudinal, 12 week studies
evaluate gain- (Cre/AAV) and loss-of-pTau function on cognitive behavior and neuron dysfunction/damage in
both sexes. The loss-of-pTau studies employ 2 models. The primary model is treatment with TRx023, an anti-
pTau drug with significant effects in a Phase III clinical trial (TauRx.com). Because it is given during the disease
process it is clinically relevant. The second model, judiciously undertaken based on TRx0237 results, is to create
a new line of Tat+ or Tg26 mice crossed with a Tau-deficient transgenic (Tau-/-) that will eliminate Tau/pTau
completely and constituitively. Overall, the studies represent a comprehensive approach that tests the role of
pTau in HAND/OUD using a design for direct correlations between tissue level damage and cognitive decline."
10924103,"The current Career Development Award-Level 2 (CDA-2) proposal will further advance Dr. Peter Na’s
research scope in psychiatric genetics through comprehensive training in psychiatric genomics,
statistical genetics, epigenetics, functional genomics and advanced psychiatric epidemiology. His
mentors are leading experts in the field of psychiatric genetics and psychosocial epidemiology - Drs.
Joel Gelernter and Robert Pietrzak. Dr. Na will also pursue additional training through advanced
workshops, seminars and courses offered by Yale University and other institutions. The proposed
research project will investigate environmental (e.g., adverse childhood experiences), and
psychosocial (e.g., purpose in life, social support) (EP) factors that moderate polygenic susceptibility
for substance use disorders (SUDs) in Veterans using state-of-the art polygenic risk scores (PRS)
computed from large contemporary genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SUDs. Further, the
proposed study will advance the field’s understanding of the biopsychosocial etiology of SUDs using
cutting-edge genetic research methodologies such as epigenetic, gene enrichment and drug-
repositioning analyses. While there have been advances in the understanding of genetics of SUDs
and EP risk and protective factors for this disorder, the interaction between biological and EP factors
in predicting SUDs remain poorly understood. To address this gap, the proposed study aims to
identify EP factors that moderate polygenic liability for SUDs in Veterans using multiple large data
sets, including the Million Veteran Program (MVP), National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study
(NHRVS) and Yale-Penn Study. This line of research directly addresses the top priority research
areas of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and this RFA (i.e., SUDs, precision medicine,
diseases with a high healthcare burden in Veterans). The moderating EP variables identified in the
proposed study will elucidate targets for clinical interventions to prevent and treat SUDs in Veterans
and ultimately help guide VA clinical practices. PRS will be derived using the GWAS of SUDs from
the MVP cohort. Potential moderating EP factors will be selected based on previous literature. The
associations between PRS, selected EP factors, and their interaction in predicting SUDs will be
examined using machine learning analyses. PRS enrichment analysis will be conducted to examine
the biological processes affected by the interaction. Further, drug repositioning analysis will be
performed to examine the biological mechanisms and identify candidate medications for SUDs that
may be further tested in animal and pilot studies. In addition, epigenetic analyses using longitudinal
data will help identify longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation differences associated with alcohol
use phenotypes in Veterans. Upon successful completion of the proposed training and research
project, Dr. Na will acquire sufficient expertise and preliminary data that will be used to pursue larger
grants such as the Merit Award and/or Career Development Transition Award and ultimately achieve
independence. Such training will be instrumental to furthering his research knowledge and skills as he
embarks an independent clinical research career as a VA psychiatrist."
10919231,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 17.6 million North Americans live within 1.6km of an oil and gas development (OGD) facility. Recent studies
indicate that OGD results in the release of reproductive toxicants (e.g., particulate matter, volatile organic
compounds [VOCs], polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) at levels that may harm human health, including
fertility, early pregnancy loss, pregnancy-related disorders, and birth outcomes. Epidemiologic studies on OGD
to date have largely focused on live birth outcomes, have not included personal exposure measurements, and
have little data on key confounders. Building upon data analysis from an NIEHS-funded predoctoral fellowship
(F31-ES029801) and training in prospective cohort designs in her postdoctoral research, Dr. Mary Willis’ Early
Independence Award application launches the first prospective cohort study on OGD-related pollution and
reproductive health. This proposal leverages ongoing recruitment from the Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO,
R01-HD086742), an internet-based preconception cohort study of North American couples trying to conceive
(n>16,000 female participants), to examine the influence of OGD-related exposures on reproductive health. This
cohort has remarkable geographic diversity, spanning all 50 U.S. states and all 10 Canadian provinces. To date,
>4,500 of the women reside in communities with OGD activity and this application will use geo-targeted methods
to enroll an additional 1,000 women. Aim 1 develops OGD-related exposure metrics in the PRESTO cohort, an
extension of Dr. Willis’ previous work. Exposure assessment methods include 1a) complex spatial data
integration of industry-related information that spans back to participants’ own births, 1b) a supplemental
questionnaire of perceived risks about OGD, and 1c) personal exposures to air, water, and noise in a subset of
150 women at three time points in the preconception to early pregnancy periods. All exposure assessment
methods are validated, state-of-the-art approaches. Aim 2 applies these exposure metrics in a longitudinal
framework to examine the influence of OGD on important reproductive health outcomes in the full PRESTO
cohort. Outcomes include 2a) fertility (fecundability, the per-cycle probability of pregnancy), 2b) pregnancy loss
(spontaneous abortion), 2c) pregnancy-related hypertensive and metabolic disorders (gestational hypertension,
pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes), and 2d) birth outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight.) The aims set the
stage for a “Research to Action” proposal that explores the efficacy of personal or community interventions for
specific OGD exposures, as well as the groundwork for an R01 proposal with follow-up for maternal postpartum
health and child development. By leveraging an established internet-based prospective cohort study, this
proposal addresses the logistical challenges of efficiently assessing the influence of health effects of emerging
environmental hazards. The results of this project have high potential to improve public health by demonstrating
a novel policy-relevant framework to investigate emerging environmental hazards. This award will allow Dr. Willis
to launch her career at the intersection of environmental epidemiology, data science, and reproductive health."

Highly skilled physician investigators are urgently needed for pediatric trial teams that can take advantage of
new technologies and respond to the increasing demands of high quality pediatric clinical trials. At the same
time, rural and underserved communities need access to and to benefit from these clinical trials. Locally,
regionally, and nationally, UNM Pediatric Clinical Triasl Center (PCTC) will support and advance pediatric
clinical trials. Our impact is significant for many reasons: 1) UNM PCTC will be a portal of entry to our diverse
patient populations including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as geographically isolated and
under-resourced rural communities; Our community-engaged approach strengthens recruitment of these
diverse populations into research studies and will improve health among pediatric populations; 2) UNM PCTC
is a needed asset locally and regionally. UNM PCTC has a dedicated and skilled research team including
trained investigators to conduct multisite pediatric clinical trials; 3) UNM PCTC will bring unique capabilities to
the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN), including
collaboration with the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC); 4) We have unique and established
strengths in clinical study infrastructure and Translational Workforce Development (TWD) as part of UNM
CTSC that will provide valuable assets to the entire ISPCTN; 5) Finally, UNM PCTC will have experienced
principal investigators (PIs) participating in multisite pediatric clinical trials and recruitment and retention from
communities and rural areas statewide. They will be a great asset to the ECHO ISPCTN. UNM PCTC will offer
an experienced team of researchers to work with the IDeA states Data Coordinating and Operations Center
(DCOC) of ECHO ISPCTN. The team will improve access to relevant populations and accelerate overall study
accrual and retention of participants while generating high-quality data that meet regulatory standards. UNM
PCTC and collaborators will offer expertise needed to identify research topics of high priority, including rural
and underserved communities. We will exert a positive impact on access and on the quality of multisite
pediatric studies in a measureable way. We will accomplish this by increasing the speed and efficiency of
multisite pediatric trials and by using innovative methods to improve engagement, enrollment, and retention of
diverse populations from New Mexico. We will sustain Network productivity by training independent pediatric
clinical-trial investigators as we advance scientific knowledge in child health."
10919237,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Homologous recombination (HR) repair-deficient cancers are dependent on polymerase theta (POLq)-mediated
DNA end joining, so that POLq is a candidate target for these cancers. This reliance extends to the PARP
inhibitor-resistant state, where POLq limits excessive DNA end resection and RAD51 loading, preventing the
accumulation of toxic intermediates. POLq deficiency has also been linked to micronucleation, a process
associated with activation of innate immunity. Through high-throughput small molecule screens, we have
recently identified the antibiotic novobiocin (NVB) as a specific POLq inhibitor that selectively kills HR-deficient
cells in vitro and in vivo, including those with acquired PARP inhibitor resistance, suggesting that NVB may be
useful alone or in combination with PARP inhibition in treating cancers with HR alterations. NVB also induces
micronucleation and consequent cGAS/STING pathway activation in HR-deficient cells. In the first Specific Aim,
multiple cell line and patient-derived xenograft models of BRCA-mutant breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer,
including those that are PARP inhibitor-sensitive and those with acquired PARP inhibitor resistance, will be
studied for response and pharmacodynamics of NVB combined with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib to compare
combinatorial antitumor and biological efficacy to that achieved by monotherapy. Pharmacodynamic effects will
be assessed using g-H2AX, pRPA and RAD51 foci as biomarkers of DNA damage, end resection and RAD51
loading, respectively, to pilot their utility for clinical trial. In the second Specific Aim, we will conduct Phase 1
clinical trials of NVB monotherapy and NVB combined with talazoparib in patients with advanced solid tumors
harboring HR alterations. The monotherapy study will utilize a BOIN design to determine the recommended
phase 2 dose of chronic monotherapy and the combination trial will utilize a waterfall design to define the MTD
contour over a two-dimensional dose matrix. Both studies will evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters and
incorporate paired biopsies for pharmacodynamic endpoints to establish proof-of-mechanism. The minimum
biological effective dose of NVB will be determined in the monotherapy trial, which will guide dosing in the
combination study. In the third Specific Aim, NVB used alone and combined with talazoparib will be studied for
induction of cGAS/STING activation in vitro, as well as in an immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse
model of BRCA-deficient breast cancer. The effects of NVB and NVB/talazoparib on the immune
microenvironment will be comprehensively characterized and antitumor activity will be assessed in the absence
and presence of immune checkpoint blockade. Taken together, the preclinical and clinical studies in this project
are designed to advance NVB-mediated POLq inhibition in the armamentarium for HR-deficient cancers."
10913964,"Project Summary
Recently, we discovered that adoptive transfer of CD39KO tumor-specific (mixed CD4+ and CD8+) T cells,
resulted in long-term survival of mice bearing large established tumors. Unexpectedly, we found that these T
cells promoted killing of antigen-loss-variants (ALVs) in vivo and prevented tumor recurrence. Moreover,
transfer of CD39KO, but not control KO, tumor-specific T cells eradicated large chimeric tumors that contained
10% of ALVs and resulted in long-term tumor-free survival and protection against rechallenge with ALV tumor
cells. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that transfer of tumor-specific CD39KO T cells will
eradicate large established tumors and prevent recurrence of ALV tumors, due to their ability to directly kill the
tumor cells and induce anti-ALV responses. Aim 1 will determine the contribution of type I IFN production at
the tumor site in preventing recurrence of ALV tumors. Aim 2 will determine the role of CD39KO T cells in the
recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells and the induction of type I IFN production for tumor clearance. Aim 3
will determine whether human tumor-specific CD39KO T cells are also endowed with these abilities to
effectively eradicate human tumors in humanized mice. These innovative and mechanistic studies will shed
light on the mechanisms underlying CD39KO T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and will thus establish a
foundation for translating this discovery into more effective immunotherapies using tumor-specific T-cell
subsets in human cancers."
10924495,"Persons living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk of chronic inflammation and the associated adverse
health outcomes. There is considerable evidence that chronic inflammatory conditions like metabolic disease
and autoimmune disorders are associated with weakened vaccine responses and existing vaccine studies in
PLWH do not adequately sample older individuals who are disproportionately affected by this “inflammaging.”
We hypothesize the effect of age on poor vaccine responses is greater among PLWH given the additional
burdens of HIV driven inflammation. The overall project goal is to examine this premise by measuring the
impact of HIV status, age, and chronic immune activation on conjugate pneumococcal vaccine responses. We
will study acute (30 day) and longer-term (2 year) immune responses following PCV20 vaccination, among a
cohort of participants including 4 groups: a) older PLWH, age ≥50 (n=100), b) older HIV uninfected controls,
age ≥50 (n=50), c) younger PLWH, age <50 (n=50), d) younger HIV uninfected controls, age <50 (n=50). With
these cohorts, we will 1) Comprehensively characterize the impact of HIV and age on the
immunogenicity of conjugate pneumococcal vaccination by longitudinally tracking adaptive vaccine-
specific antibody, B cell and CD4 T cell responses. We will compare these responses by age and HIV
status. We will also 2) Determine the influence of chronic inflammation on vaccine-specific immunity
among PLWH across the adult lifespan by measuring the associate between vaccine immunity and
biomarkers of chronic inflammation. This project will provide valuable knowledge on how HIV and age
influence vaccine immune responses with the hope of informing vaccine development and schedule to
optimize the long-term health of persons living with HIV."
10925871,"Project Summary
The elimination of HIV transmission with virally-suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) has provided the world
with a clear path to end the HIV epidemic through the provision of ART at HIV diagnosis. Undetectable HIV
is untransmittable (U=U). However we found limited knowledge of U=U among lay people in South Africa.
The U=U campaign was launched in 2016 to disseminate the scientific evidence that people with HIV cannot
transmit the virus if their viral load is undetectable. U=U has been endorsed by NIH, CDC, Pepfar, and
organizations in over 100 countries. U=U has been shown to reduce stigma, improve quality of life for people
living with HIV, and increase HIV testing. However, there is a critical need for evidence on (a) how best to
disseminate information on U=U, and (b) the impact of U=U on ART adherence and viral suppression.
With support from an NIH R34, we developed and piloted the “Undetectable & You” App, an educational
U=U intervention designed as a support tool for HIV counseling in South Africa. The App was “co-created” with
PLHIV and health providers and features the stories of PLHIV and their partners alongside the science of U=U.
In this R01, we will (Aim 1) refine the App based on lessons learned from our pilot; and (Aim 2)
establish the impact of the App on viral suppression in a cluster-randomized efficacy trial. We will
collect outcomes data through a prospective survey sample (n=880) as well as through the National Health
Laboratory Service (NHLS) National HIV Cohort (which we previously developed with NHLS), which offers a
platform for evaluation using fully de-identified data. We will assess impacts on viral suppression (primary
outcome) as well as ART visit adherence, retention in care, knowledge, attitudes, and mental health; and
incident STIs and pregnancies. The study builds on a longstanding collaboration between the PIs (Dr. Jacob
Bor, Dr. Dorina Onoya) and between Boston University and the Health Economics and Epidemiology Research
Office (HE2RO) at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. The study will be implemented in close
collaboration with South Africa’s National Department of Health (HIV Cluster) and Anova Health.
This study is highly innovative because we take a novel approach – disseminating information on the
prevention benefits of ART – to improve wellbeing of PLHIV and to motivate ART adherence leading to viral
suppression. The research will have significant public health impact as the findings have potential to shape
HIV counseling guidelines and U=U dissemination in the country with the world’s largest HIV epidemic."
10922163,"ABSTRACT
This application presents MT-601, a novel multi-tumor associated antigen (mTAA)-specific T cell product for the
treatment of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). NHL is the most common hematologic malignancy with ~80,550
new cases and >20,000 deaths in the US expected in 2023. Adoptive T cell transfer, e.g., CAR T cells, have
impressive potency in NHL yet are also associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.
Additionally, relapse rates are up to 60% post-CAR T therapy due to low antigen levels or loss of CD19
expression. To date there are no approved therapies for NHL patients who relapsed after CAR T cell therapy,
resulting in a huge unmet medical need for alternate treatment options for NHL.
MT-601 represents a novel T cell-based immunotherapy that simultaneously targets 6 tumor-associated antigens
(TAA) (PRAME, NY-ESO1, survivin, MAGE-A4, SSX2, WT1) that are overexpressed in NHL but absent or with
limited expression in healthy tissue, thereby minimizing tumor escape and enhancing anti-tumor response.
Manufactured from autologous apheresis material, MT-601 recognizes target cells via native T cell receptors by
interacting with tumor antigen-expressing target cells presenting antigen in the context of both class I and II HLA,
leading to killing of tumor cells expressing any of these antigens and recruiting the patient’s immune system in
the anti-tumor response. Although other cellular immunotherapies attempt to address CD19 CAR T cell failures
by targeting 2-3 antigens, they are limited by 1) narrow epitope recognition, and 2) leaving the tumor susceptible
to relapse. In addition to broad-spectrum antigen targeting, MT-601 is the only cellular therapy being explored in
NHL patients who relapsed following CAR T therapy. Additional advantages of MT-601 include out-patient
administration and no genetic engineering. Furthermore, Marker’s multiTAA-specific technology was proven
clinically safe in >180 patients with various kinds of cancer. In a phase 1 trial of lymphoma patients using
multiTAA-specific T cells targeting 5 TAAs, patients had durable responses for much longer than those typically
associated with CAR T cells (6 years versus 28 months). Notably, Marker recently treated our first CAR T
cell relapsed NHL patient, who shows a complete response at 12 weeks post-infusion.
Based on this promising clinical data, Marker proposes a single-arm Phase 1 clinical study to advance MT-601
for patients with NHL that relapsed after third line CAR T treatment and do not have other approved therapy
options. The objective of Specific Aim 1 is to manufacture MT-601 and execute the clinical protocol by treating
NHL patients who have relapsed after CD19 CAR T cell therapy with MT-601. Specific Aim 2 will correlate
biological characteristics in the product profile with clinical safety and efficacy outcomes. Successful completion
of this grant will provide clinical proof of concept for MT-601 as a treatment for CAR relapsed NHL patients, and
support future clinical trials leading to future BLA filing and commercial approval of MT-601."

Malaria remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases. Although much progress has been made
in the fight against malaria, a highly effective and durable vaccine is not available. New vaccine
candidates and improved delivery strategies are urgently needed. We recently demonstrated that
a Anopheles gambiae mosquito saliva protein, called AgTRIO, is a viable mRNA-LNP vaccine in
mice, either as a single agent or in synergistic combination with the target of the currently
marketed RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix). This project addresses the real-world problem of
delivery of an antimalaria mRNA vaccine in endemic, resource-poor countries where cold-
chain storage hugely limits deployment of mRNA vaccines. Our product solution employs
novel dissolvable microneedle patches (MNPs) to administer our AgTRIO mRNA-LNP
formulation. These microneedle patches can be self-applied, are less painful than intramuscular
injection, produce no sharps waste, have a long-term shelf life for up to six months at room
temperature, and can be produced at scale with robust methods. The single specific aim of this

10922472,"Abstract:
The goal of this SBIR project is to develop and commercialize a targeted fluorescence dye
for intraoperative fluorescence imaging and precision surgical treatment of head and neck
cancer (HNC). Surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation is a
routine therapeutic strategy for HNC, yet locoregional recurrences occur in up to 30% of
patients due in part to minimal residual disease in the local tissues. Furthermore, many
HNC patients undergo neck dissection procedures to remove lymph nodes at-risk of or
containing metastatic tumor nodules, but up to 30% of patients exhibit occult metastases
that remain undetected until the disease has progressed. Both of these surgical strategies
are highly invasive, extracting wide surgical margins around solid tumors and regularly
affecting or removing functional tissue structures, making post-treatment patient quality of
life a significant clinical problem. Thus, a clinical challenge for complete tumor resection
during primary and metastatic HNC surgeries is highly sensitive detection of small tumors
and accurate delineation of tumor margins during surgical operations. Although some
targeted fluorescence probes are undergoing clinical development for HNC, most exhibit
large chemical structures, which requires them to be injected several hours to days prior
to surgery, and target cell surface markers, which are not always tumor-specific and
exhibit highly heterogeneous and dynamic expression. We hypothesize that a small
fluorescently-labeled peptide specific to an oncoprotein in the tumor extracellular matrix
(ECM) can be used to visualize and guide complete resection of HNC. To test this
hypothesis, we propose to synthesize and characterize a small peptide-targeted
fluorescence dye specific to the ECM oncoprotein in Aim 1, and to determine its specificity
and effectiveness for visualization and tumor margin assessment of HNC in animal models
in Aim 2. The targeted fluorescence dye can be intravenously injected or applied topically
to fluorescently stain HNC tumors to assist surgeons in identify tumors and defining tumor
boundaries for complete resection of tumor tissues. After successful demonstration of the
feasibility of the targeted imaging probe in this Phase I SBIR project, further preclinical
investigations and development will be performed in Phase II for clinical translation and
commercialization of the dye for image-guided surgery of HNC."

Our mixed-methods implementation hybrid (type I) pilot RCT will develop a self-administered PrEP Decisional Aid for
dissemination with Self-administered HIV test kits (DASH), and pilot it with 120 users of the Together Take Me Home
(TTMH) National free HIVST kit distribution program to characterize the potential impact of the DASH on increasing PrEP
awareness, accurate PrEP knowledge, and PrEP starts, with 30 qualitative in-depth interviews to expand understanding,
and characterization of meta-data for users of the DASH to advise refinements in the decision aid tool. Our team, in
collaboration with our expert advisory committee and community review panel of TTMH HIV self-test users, will work
with Radiant Technologies to develop the decisional aid with up-to-date content on PrEP choices, values clarification
exercises to promote decisional clarity in considering PrEP, and active links to local and remote (online) PrEP prescribing
resources. Among individuals requesting a HIVST through TTMH (ages 17-30 per TTMH protocol), we will recruit HIVST
requesters and randomly assign individuals to the DASH or standard condition (1:1), collecting baseline, 1- and 3-month
survey data. DASH participants receive a unique, time-sensitive link to the mobile friendly decision aid website, and
reminders to use the link prior to expiration (2 weeks from baseline). Standard condition arm participants receive the
standard HIVST kit and information about PrEP on the TTMH HIVST request website. All participants with negative HIV-
test results continue in the study for month 1 and 3 surveys. PrEP starts at 3-months will be characterized between
arms. Changes in accurate PrEP information and intentions to use PrEP from baseline to 1- and 3-month follow-up will
be compared between study arms using longitudinal growth modeling; feasibility/acceptability of the program (DASH or
standard KIT contents) will be assessed using mixed methods with survey data and 30 qualitative interviews with
participants in each arm (20 in DASH and 10 in standard condition), and meta-data from DASH (use, time in components,
links to resources) will be characterized. The goal of our work is to develop a feasible and acceptable PrEP resource to
accompany national dissemination of HIVST kits. The objective of the study is to produce the DASH and estimates
needed to conduct a powered, large-scale efficacy RCT."
10923386,"40 years into the pandemic, stigma remains the most challenging barrier for HIV prevention. A quarter of
people living with HIV remain untested, depriving them of opportunities to enter the HIV prevention continuum
and access evidence based prevention tools. Testing is particularly low in gay and bisexual men who have sex
with men (MSM) who face additional discrimination on account of their same sex behaviors. Stigma can be
internalized or anticipated but it is most pernicious when it is enacted in healthcare settings, as this directly
bars care access while also discouraging future care seeking. Enacted healthcare stigma is notoriously difficult
to measure, as few providers willingly report discriminatory behavior and patients lack the medical knowledge
to assess the appropriateness of care. Our solution is to conduct unannounced standardized patient (SP) visits
to measure and address enacted healthcare stigma. SPs are actors hired from the local community and trained
to present standardized, unannounced disease cases in area clinics for the purposes of evaluation and
feedback. Their ability to objectively document provider behaviors through unannounced visits presents an
elegant solution to the common tendency of providers to alter behaviors under observation. By randomly
varying the sexual orientation and HIV status of presented cases, our technique obtains discrete measures of
HIV, sexual, and intersectional stigma. Results of an initial round of SP visits are shared with advisory boards
of providers and MSM to solicit their views on stigma drivers which inform a tailored stigma reduction training
for study providers which is then evaluated in a second round of visits. Our team has conducted an NIH-funded
pilot randomized control trial (RCT) in southern China that demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability of the
SP approach for measuring and reducing stigma (R34MH121251). This R01 application follows on the success
of the R34 to propose a fully powered cluster RCT using tools, lessons, and experience gained form our pilot.
This trial will newly include rural clinics to expand generalizability and will also explore future implementation
potential of our intervention with regional policy makers. Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in HIV
prevention, stigma, LGBT health, standardized patient research, and medical education to investigate the
following aims: 1) Conduct a baseline round of SP visits to inform the design of a SP-informed stigma reduction
intervention with support from MSM and provider community advisory boards; 2) implement the intervention in
treatment arm clinics and evaluate its impact on enacted stigma and clinic-level HIV testing volume and 3)
conduct qualitative interviews with stakeholders (providers, MSM, health officials) to help inform the design of a
Implementation Blueprint to guide potential future adopters in assessing its suitability and their team readiness
to implement a SP-informed stigma intervention in their setting."
10917488,"Project Summary
 Proper gene expression regulation is pivotal for cellular function, and its dysregulation contributes to
disease. Transcription factors (TFs) initiate gene expression by identifying binding sites in enhancers and
promoters and recruiting the transcriptional machinery. However, the nucleus's crowded nature and the
abundance of non-specific sites make it extremely challenging for TFs to efficiently search for and binding
correct DNA binding sites. This project addresses the fundamental question: How do TFs efficiently locate
specific sites amidst numerous non-specific ones inside a crowded nucleus?
 Innovatively, this study employs a new advanced microscopy technique that overcomes the low
spatiotemporal resolution associated with camera-based single-molecule tracking. This approach enables
precise tracking of TFs in live human and mouse cells with unprecedented spatial (~2-4 nm) and temporal (one
hundred microseconds) precision. This transformative approach represents a substantial advancement over
traditional methods, facilitating the investigation of TF search mechanisms. By comprehensively tracing TFs'
3D diffusion, DNA interactions, and target site discrimination, we will resolve the TF target search mechanism.
 First, we will optimize and validate the proposed tracking method and develop novel computational
methods for handling and analyzing these new types of tracking data. Second, we will apply this technology to
understand how TFs involved in pluripotency and genome structure find their target sites and elucidate how
individual protein domains affect the target search mechanisms. Third, we will apply this technology to uncover
the oncogenic potential of fusion TFs in several cancers. Fourth, we will leverage these studies to understand
how “search domains” in TFs regulate the target search mechanism and efficiency towards the rational design
of synthetic TFs with tunable search properties. Taken together, this proposal will reveal how TFs find their
target sites with applications to synthetic biology and cancer biology."

 Several human proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils, and these fibrils are associated
with devastating diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type II diabetes, and dialysis-
related amyloidosis (DRA). The protein β-2-microglobulin (β2m) forms amyloid fibrils in the joints
of patients undergoing hemodialysis, leading to DRA. While protein amyloid formation has been
extensively studied, molecular-level information about the early stages of amyloid formation is
only beginning to be revealed for a few proteins. This information, though, is critical for the rational
development of therapeutics against amyloid diseases, particularly for DRA that has no treatment.
 Our group has been developing and applying new mass spectrometry (MS) methods to reveal
structural and oligomeric changes that β2m undergoes before forming amyloid fibrils. Such
structural information is very challenging to obtain using traditional biophysical methods, and the
structural insight from our new methods has led to exciting discoveries about the first steps of
protein amyloid formation. We are beginning to utilize this insight to find inhibitors of DRA.
 The research in this MIRA project seeks to (i) develop new methods that will deepen our
mechanistic insight into the first steps of β2m amyloid formation and (ii) leverage this new
mechanistic information to discover robust inhibitors of β2m amyloid formation. These goals will
be accomplished by creating new MS methods that rely on covalent labeling, ion mobility, and
computational modeling. These new approaches will allow us to probe the energy landscape of
the structural switch that initiates β2m amyloid formation, providing unprecedented quantitative
insight into the factors that cause this normally stable protein to become amyloidogenic. We will
also explore new methods to characterize the on- and off-pathway isomeric oligomers that are
present during the early stages of β2m amyloid formation, allowing us to reveal the specific
protein-protein interactions that lead to amyloids. Altogether, the structural insights that we obtain
will then be utilized to discover new inhibitors of β2m amyloid formation. Specific outcomes of this
research will be new biophysical tools to study protein amyloid formation and the identification of
inhibitors that could lead to therapeutics against DRA. The universality of the techniques
developed in this work will also make them applicable to other amyloid systems and diseases."

Enzymatic assays are critical for drug discovery: half of approved small molecule drugs inhibit enzymes, and
enzymatic HTS (high throughput screening) assays are typically the most frequently used tool during
development of a candidate molecule. Even as computational approaches become more prevalent, enzymatic
assays are required to test the activity of molecules following virtual screens and throughout the hit-to-lead
process. Enzymes that produce small molecules can present a special challenge from an assay development
perspective because selective detection of reaction products that closely resemble substrates in a homogenous
format may exceed the molecular recognition capabilities of known affinity reagents such as antibodies.
Examples include epigenetic enzyme families currently under intense focus as therapeutic targets: histone
acetyltransferases, sirtuins, and histone demethylases.
To overcome these limitations, we will combine the vast ligand binding capabilities of native proteins with in vitro
selection to develop chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems for small molecule enzyme products. In
Phase I, we will develop and validate a CID that is capable of detecting nanomolar concentrations of CoA
(coenzyme A) in the presence of excess AcCoA (acetyl-CoA), providing a universal assay method for histone
acetyltransferases. Candidate CoA binding domains (BDCoA) will be selected from native proteins, and a library
of randomized antibody variable domains will then be screened to identify second binding domains that recognize
the CoA- BDCoA interface, providing a substantial enhancement of affinity and selectivity. The resulting CoA CID
will be formatted for TR-FRET and validated with purified HATs in pilot screens, enabling a robust universal HAT
enzymatic activity with the sensitivity and specificity needed for HTS.
In Phase II, we will develop CID systems for other small molecule enzyme products that have proven intractable
to immunodetection, e.g., succinate for histone demethylases and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose for histone
deacetylases. The CID system will accelerate drug discovery by providing a very broad and flexible HTS enzyme
assay platform for both established and emerging target families."

Automated liquid handling technologies play a pivotal role across the diverse realms of biomedical research by
streamlining experimental processes and enhancing precision. In the context of genomics, these technologies
enable high-throughput sample preparation for DNA sequencing, advancing our understanding of genetics and
its role in disease. In drug discovery, liquid handling technologies expedite the screening of compounds against
various targets, accelerating the identification and development of potential therapeutics. Nonetheless, a
fundamental limitation plagues most automated liquid handling technologies: they require liquids to engage in
physical contact with solid structures during manipulation. Consequently, remnants of reagents tend to adhere
to the contact surface, potentially dissolving into and contaminating subsequent liquid samples. In this SBIR
project, we will develop and commercialize the AcoustoDrop technology, which overcomes many of the key
obstacles associated with existing liquid-handling systems, such as surface adsorption, surface degradation,
and intra-droplet polarization. AcoustoDrop is an acoustic-based, programmable, contactless liquid-handling
technology that allows one to transport, merge, mix, split, and eject reagents within aqueous droplets in a
rewritable, programmable biocompatible, and high-throughput manner. In our Phase-I-type R&D efforts, Ascent
has successfully demonstrated the utility and feasibility of the proposed AcoustoDrop devices by meeting or
exceeding the target values of each of the five key parameters identified in the Measures of Success. In Phase
II, our commercialization activities will improve the performance of the AcoustoDrop chips, develop self-
contained, beta-testing-ready prototypes, and validate their performance across two well-established
applications in stem cell therapeutics and high-throughput drug screening. Our proposed AcoustoDrop
technology has the following features: (1) High throughput (> 2,500 reactions/sec) in comparison to benchmark
technologies (~384 reactions/sec); (2) High programmability (> 20 cascade layers) in comparison to
benchmark technologies (1-2 cascade layers); (3) Low levels of cross-contamination (< 10-10 % diffusion); (4)
High biocompatibility: Instead of being directly subjected to strong acoustic pressure or high electric fields, the
droplets are manipulated in a contactless, gentle manner. Our preliminary results show that the AcoustoDrop
platform does not have a significant effect on the viability of cells. (5) High versatility: The AcoustoDrop platform
suitable for handling a wide range of liquids, even for challenging samples such as low-polarity fluids (e.g.,
organic solvents), sticky or viscous samples (e.g., blood and sputum), and solids (e.g., fecal samples and model
organisms). With the aforementioned features, the proposed AcoustoDrop technology has the potential to
exceed current industry standards, address unmet needs in the field, and provide a compelling platform for the
development of a robust, rewritable, high-throughput, and digitally-programmable fluidic processor."

Asthma is a significant public health concern affecting the quality of life of over 8% of the US population and
causing more than a million emergency department visits every year. The standard of care for asthma
changed dramatically with the publication of the 2020 NHLBI Asthma Management Guidelines: Focused
Updates. The guidelines contained paradigm-shifting recommendations for treatment and monitoring. Of 19
recommendations, 16 were considered ‘conditional’, meaning that shared decision making (SDM) between the
provider and patient was advised prior to choosing an option. Unfortunately, many of the recommendations
have yet to be incorporated into the care of asthma patients: less than 50% of the recommendations had been
incorporated into clinical practice and over a third of surveyed of physicians had no awareness of the new
asthma recommendations. Such delays in guideline implementation have been associated with adverse health
outcomes, increased costs, and worsening health disparities. We previously developed an intervention that can
collect patient-entered data pertinent to SDM in asthma which is then utilized by providers during office visits.
This intervention was well received by both patients and physicians, improving patient satisfaction and quality
of SDM during the clinical encounter.
There is now an urgent need to develop a clinical decision-support (CDS) application that incorporates the key
recommendations from the Asthma Guidelines Update, patient-specific clinical information, SDM-relevant
patient values and preferences, and the social determinants of the health (SDOH) of the patient. To make the
application widely usable, the CDS application must be based on EHR interoperability standards that will make
it easier to implement CDS at multiple sites. The long-term objectives of this project are to design, develop,
rigorously evaluate, and disseminate TIBSA (tailored interoperable guideline-based clinical decision-support
system for asthma). TIBSA will be designed to address common deficiencies in CDS such as usability and
poor applicability to the patient. In this Phase I project we will focus on the treatment of asthma in adults with
these objectives:
 1. Identify the requirements and create the design of TIBSA collaboratively with patients, clinicians and
 informaticians. The design will be validated and refined in two focus group panels representing clinical
 users and patients with asthma.
 2. Create a minimally viable product version of TIBSA. We will create the application with Sapphire, our
 rapid application development platform that has capabilities for clinician SMART on FHIR apps,
 workflow automation, decision-support logic evaluation, and flexible engagement with patients. The
 application will be evaluated with clinicians and patients in a usability studyl. We will obtain data from
 these subjects on feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of TIBSA.
In Phase II of this project, we will further refine TIBSA, and test its integration with EHRs. We will deploy the
application within at least two clinical sites and perform an evaluation of its acceptance and impact on clinician
adherence to guidelines and patient satisfaction with treatment decisions."

Sedentary behavior (i.e., sitting) has emerged as an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, some cancers, and mortality. Working adults with desk-bound occupations accumulate large volumes
of daily sedentary time. Sit-stand workstations are now the fastest growing employee benefit, yet evidence-based
interventions are not being implemented to support their use. Our team has completed the largest and most
definitive efficacy trial on the impact of an intervention to support use of sit-stand workstations and reduce
sedentary behavior in the workplace. Stand & Move at Work (SMW) is a multicomponent, social-ecological
behavioral intervention tested in 24 industry, government, and academic worksites (N=630 workers). Intervention
effects included: (a) reductions in sedentary time at 12 months (~60 min/8 h workday) that were retained at 24-
month follow-up (~30 min/8 h workday); (b) reduced body weight and improved chronic disease risk factors
among those with high baseline risk; and (c) reduced musculoskeletal pain. We are now proposing a new trial
that tests the role of expert-based facilitation to enhance effectiveness and implementation of the SMW
intervention. We use the Integrated - Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services
(iPARIHS) framework to inform our new trial through: (a) organizing our implementation outcomes from our
efficacy trial; (b) conducting industry-based discovery interviews; and (c) piloting our enhanced implementation
strategy in new worksites. We propose a 2-arm group-randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation (type 2)
trial to test the effectiveness of SMW for reducing sedentary time in the workplace, and to test an implementation
strategy (i.e., expert facilitation) for improving implementation fidelity. Worksites (N=24) will be observed over 3
months of sit-stand workstation use only, and will then be randomized to 12 months of either: (a) SMW (web-
delivered); or (b) SMW+ (web-delivered + expert facilitation). Our dual primary outcomes will be reductions in
objectively-measured sedentary time (effectiveness) and intervention fidelity (implementation) over 12 months.
Because facilitation increases intervention cost, we will also assess incremental cost benefit of our interventions
(secondary aim). Finally, we will explore fidelity as a driver of effectiveness, examine within-worksite differences
in sedentary time pre- and post- implementation, and measure organizational sustainability of effectiveness and
implementation at 24 months. The potential health benefits of sit-stand workstations and associated worksite
health promotion programs will not be realized in the workforce at large until we test the most effective and
efficient way to implement evidence-based interventions. This project is among the first initiatives to address this
growing trend in worksite health, and will answer important questions related to effectiveness, implementation,
and cost benefit. Optimal strategies for delivering the SMW intervention will be identified and new knowledge will
be generated on how facilitation can enhance implementation fidelity of workplace health initiatives, both of which
will increase the public health impact of evidence-based interventions."

10924783,"To study and improve healthcare outcomes for our Veterans, the Million Veteran Program (MVP) has collected
genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data from more than 650,000 Veterans. As the largest biobank in
the world, the MVP presents a unique opportunity to advance our understanding in detecting and treating
Veterans with serious mental illnesses (SMI). Nevertheless, prior research has indicated that translational
research is often not equitable across demographic groups due to differences in sample sizes and healthcare
disparities affecting the quality of the EHR data. Consequently, this proposal leverages novel statistical
approaches to boost the effective sample sizes across demographic groups.
To achieve these goals, genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies will be meta-analyzed using
a novel meta-analytic approach, PheMED, that can integrate data of heterogeneous quality to boost sample
sizes to detect novel genetic risk loci correlated with SMI related traits. First, PheMED will be leveraged to
integrate results from different trait definitions within a given demographic group for 21 different SMI related
traits. For example, case definitions for bipolar disorder can be defined based on different code count
thresholds, as recorded in the EHR. By leveraging a data-driven approach for integrating different thresholds
for defining bipolar disorder cases, PheMED boosts the number of cases across different demographic groups,
such as sex and ancestry. These PheMED meta-analyses will facilitate the discovery of new genetic risk loci
linked to serious mental illness related traits. The PheMED genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association
meta-analyses will then be employed to create polygenic risk scores on a 50% hold out set across different
demographic groups. As the prevalence of many serious mental illness related traits depends on sex, this
proposal will then leverage existing imputed genetic data to conduct association tests on the X chromosome to
improve polygenic risk stratification and detection of genetic variants linked to SMI related phenotypes. Code
for implementing this pipeline will be shared with the broader MVP research community to promote equitability
in research and advance targeted genetic findings for both male and female Veterans.
Subsequently, PheMED will be used to synthesize findings across different demographic groups. Notably,
PheMED can also adjust for diluted genetic effects that are driven by hidden gene-environment interactions
and phenotype data quality issues that are confounded with sex or ancestry, such as cryptic healthcare
disparities coded in the EHR data. These cross-demographic meta-analyses will then be used to discover new
genetic variants and to generate improved polygenic risk scores to better detect SMI-related traits.
Finally, this proposal will construct data-driven phenotypes for three serious mental illness traits: schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. These data-driven phenotypes are generated using machine
learning techniques to identify related characteristics in the EHR data and boost sample sizes for demographic
stratified and cross demographic genomic analyses. These data-driven phenotypes will then be utilized to
detect novel genetic risk loci in genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies and improve
polygenic risk score performance. By leveraging data-driven phenotypes and novel meta-analytic techniques,
to power for performing genomic analyses, this proposal aims to mitigate historic disparities in genomic
research and improve the translational potential of precision psychiatry for Veterans across all demographic
groups."
10915902,"Abstract
 Every year in the United States, nearly 500,000 patients develop an infection on a
ventilator, of which an estimated 1 in 3 die. Ventilator-associated infections are the leading cause
of mortality in the ICU and add $8B to US healthcare spending annually. Caring for patients on
ventilators is multifactorial, but the driver of infection is silent aspiration (harmful fluid entering
the airway without a patient response like coughing). Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) facilitate
mechanical ventilation, and patients must rely on ETTs to prevent aspiration. For the last 50 years,
ETTs have used an inflatable balloon to create a seal in the airway to prevent silent aspiration. The
problem is that these balloons often fail by creasing, deflating, or migrating, which allows harmful
fluid to enter the lungs, increasing the risk of infection for ventilated patients.
 To solve this problem, Respair developed RelianceET, an ETT that replaces the error-
prone balloon with ultra-soft baffles (thin, flexible discs). The baffles gently fold along the trachea
wall to comprehensively seal the airway while exerting less force than a balloon. In preliminary
testing, RelianceET was 98% more effective than current ETTs in preventing leaks. Respair
conducted over 100 interviews with clinicians and purchasers to map the needs of key
stakeholders. Respair also met with FDA to validate novel safety test protocols for this SBIR. What
remains unknown is if the baffle sealing mechanism is safe and effective across adult airway sizes.
 This SBIR has two specific aims to achieve critical milestones that assess the feasibility of
RelianceET in adult airways. Aim 1: Complete comprehensive leak, tracheal force, and
ventilatory pressure tests on prototypes in preparation for FDA submission. Respair will test
RelianceET prototypes using novel protocols to quantify critical safety metrics that validate the baffle
sealing mechanism across adult airway sizes. Aim 2: Evaluate the insertion and removal forces
of ETTs on a novel benchtop model that includes the larynx (vocal folds) and trachea. Respair
will develop and use 3D-printed airway models to compare the insertion and removal forces of
RelianceET versus current ETTs. The models also quantify forces exerted on the vocal folds. During
interviews, Respair found that comparative force data is required to convince stakeholders.
 Completing these objectives will validate RelianceET’s technical feasibility and safety,
enabling Respair to reach a final design freeze. Respair aims to create a new standard for critical
care by commercializing a safer and more effective endotracheal tube to improve outcomes for
vulnerable patients on ventilators."

Hydrogenase enzymes are pervasive, being found in bacteria, archaea, and some
higher organisms. These enzymes are hosted by some pathogens, often in anaerobic
environments including the human gut. The hydrogenases mediate the most
fundamental chemical reaction: the interconversion of H2 with protons and reducing
equivalents. The enzymes are structurally exceptional with an array of distinctive
cofactors, especially the site of H2 binding and release. Interest in such enzymes stems
from three angles: the possibility that some pathogens could be controlled rationally, the
excitement about their unusual structures, and the commercial implications of hydrogen
production/oxidation in the context of fuel cells.
Two major classes of hydrogenases exist, [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases. This
project is almost exclusively focused on the latter. More specifically, this project aims to
elucidate the biosynthesis of the active site of [FeFe] enzymes, the faster hydrogenase
and the one most amenable to development for other applications. This project is timely
because we have just defined the sequence by which the three maturase enzymes build
the active site. In parallel with their unusual structures, the construction (biosynthesis)
of the active site proceeds unusually.
The first subproject aims to make the first Fe-containing intermediate, ""Compound B"".
The next two projects tackle how B is converted to an inorganic Fe-S-CN-CO monomer.
The fourth project examines the coupling of this monomer to give an inorganic dimer.
The final and fifth project examines the retrofitting of this Fe2 entity with an organic
cofactor.
In this program collateral projects address allied themes of still broader interest. One
involves expanding our knowledge of iron complexes of amino acids. Another
contributes to the biosynthesis of [NiFe]-hydrogenases. One spin-off project critically
examines the premises of the Iron-Sulfur Theory of the origin of life by examination of
the first Fe-S-CN-CO complexes."

Approximately 70% of breast cancers (BCs) are estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+) and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Endocrine therapy (ET) reduces recurrence risk and improves
survival for many in this group. However, despite standard of care and adjuvant ET, over 20% of patients with
ER+/HER2- BC experience metastatic recurrence in the years to come, and virtually all patients with metastatic
disease eventually experience disease progression on ET due to intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms.
Progression on ET, however, does not preclude continued responsiveness to alternate forms of ET, including
those that combine therapies directed at ER and key signaling pathways that drive ET resistance. However,
there are currently no biomarkers that can reliably identify which patients will benefit from ET-based approaches
so that chemotherapy could be avoided or delayed. The PgR gene is highly regulated by ER at the RNA and
protein level, and thus expression of PgR in ER+ BC would be indicative of the functional status of ER and
associated predictive benefit from ET. We propose to evaluate the utility of positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging with the PgR radiotracer, [18F]fluoro-furanyl-norprogesterone (FFNP) to predict response to ET-based
therapies. In a recent phase II single-arm clinical trial, we demonstrated that FFNP-PET imaging, before and
after a one-day estradiol (E2) challenge (ΔFFNP-PET), predicted response to ET with 100% sensitivity and 100%
specificity in women with advanced ER+ BC. In this proposal, we will dissect the functional relationship between
PgR and ER and its implications for ΔFFNP-PET as a predictive imaging biomarker of ER function for the full
range of current and emerging ET-based approaches using patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) and
genetically engineered models, interfacing with a clinical trial. We propose three Aims. In Aim 1, we will examine
the impact of ESR1 gene mutations on ER-PgR crosstalk, PgR expression, and ΔFFNP-PET as an imaging
biomarker of ER function in preclinical models. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the utility of ΔFFNP-PET in predicting
response to single agent ET agents alone and in combination with targeted therapies in PDX models of
ER+/HER2- BC. In Aim 3, we will interface with a clinical trial to examine the impact of tumor genomics on
ΔFFNP-PET and its accuracy in predicting response to therapy in patients with metastatic ER+ HER2- breast
cancer enrolled in a phase II trial of endocrine therapy in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib.
Overall, this study aims to have a far-reaching and high impact on the implementation of precision medicine in
identifying, stratifying, and predicting response to clinically available and novel SERDs alone and in combination
with other targeted therapies in patients with advanced ER+/HER2- BC."
10914108,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic itch affects 13% of the population and is associated with over $90 billion in annual population-
expenditures in the US. It has a profound negative impact on quality of life, and is often as debilitating as chronic
pain. Yet, there are currently no FDA-approved treatments for chronic itch. A major obstacle in assessing
therapeutics for itch is the difficulty in measuring it, which hinders assessment of outcomes in the clinic and the
development of new drugs. The current clinical standard for quantifying itch relies on patients’ self-assessment
of the severity of their itch on a scale of 0 to 10, which is: 1) highly subjective and hard to generalize across
patients, 2) lacks sensitivity to small changes, and 3) is difficult to use in vulnerable populations such as children
and those with cognitive impairment. Thus, clinical research on itch has an urgent need for a new objective,
accurate, and low overhead method for quantifying itch. Furthermore, given that disturbed sleep is a major factor
leading to diminished quality of life for chronic itch patients, the new method should ideally also assess sleep
quality. The overall objective of our proposal is to provide an objective, sensitive, and reliable metric for
measuring both itch and its impact on sleep. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a novel, wireless
sensor can be employed to effectively capture scratching activity and associated itch morbidity, and also
measure its impact on sleep. Our approach is based on a non-obtrusive wireless device that sits in the
background at home, much like a Wi-Fi router. It analyses the radio signals that bounce off people's bodies using
novel machine learning models to infer people’s sleep quality and scratching motion -- and it does it in a touchless
manner without asking patients to wear sensors, or incur any burden. The Katabi lab invented this sensor
technology and has already demonstrated its ability to measure sleep stages, respiration signal, heart rate, falls,
gait and other behaviors in humans. Further, the Katabi and Kim labs have preliminary data that demonstrate
the feasibility of extending this method to monitor scratching in a touchless manner in chronic itch patients. The
specific aims of this proposal will assess the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this novel method in
measuring nocturnal scratching in chronic itch patients, its performance in comparison to the current clinical
standard based on patients’ self-assessment of their condition, and its ability to track changes over time in the
same patient. It will also leverage the device’s ability to monitor sleep to assess the impact of itch on patients’
sleep quality, and the relationship between sleep metrics (e.g., sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and sleep stages)
and scratching severity. The rationale for this proposal is that the ability to quantify itch and its impact on sleep
in an objective, sensitive method that is widely applicable, including to children and cognitively impaired patients,
would improve clinical research, and facilitate the assessment of therapeutics for both disease management and
drug development."
10914109,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Treatment of cancer has been transformed by immunotherapies that aim to reactivate tumor-specific immune
cell responses, in particular checkpoint blockade therapies that target inhibitory receptors on T cells. Although
these therapeutics have achieved durable clinical responses, many patients do not respond or shortly relapse.
Rationale design of effective immunotherapy strategies requires a detailed understanding of the dynamics
between tumors and the immune system. My goal is to decode these dynamic interactions using a combination
of in vivo models, genomic technologies, and large-scale analyses of patient data to gain novel insights into the
biological processes that underlie cancer progression and response to immunotherapy. In the F99 phase, I aim
to identify to origin of immune cells that respond to checkpoint blockade. An outstanding question is whether the
T cell response to checkpoint blockade relies on reinvigoration of pre-existing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or
on recruitment of novel T cells. In my dissertation work so far, I have used single cell RNA and T cell receptor
(TCR) sequencing of site-matched tumor biopsies before and after PD-1 blockade to profile clonal T cell
dynamics in response to immunotherapy. I found that T cells that clonally expand in response to PD-1 blockade
are enriched for novel clones that have not been previously observed in the same tumor, a phenomenon we
term clonal replacement. However, the source of novel T cells as well as the role of other immune cell populations
in this process remain unclear. I hypothesize that novel T cells are derived from secondary lymphoid organs and
that overcoming deficiencies in T cell priming by antigen presenting cells is required for clonal replacement
following PD-1 blockade. I will use a combination of flow cytometry, single cell sequencing, and bulk TCR
sequencing of in vivo syngeneic mouse tumor models to determine the origin of T cells that respond to PD-1 and
CTLA-4 blockade. Further, I will use genetic mouse models to determine the role of PD-L1 expression on antigen
presenting cells, in particular conventional type 1 dendritic cells, on PD-1 blockade efficiency. In the K00 phase,
I aim to elucidate the relationship between extrachromosomal DNA amplification, innate immune signaling, and
the efficacy of checkpoint blockade. Copy number alterations leading to oncogene amplification frequently occurs
on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), which are commonly found in the cytoplasm due to lack to
centromeres and associate with loss of cytosolic DNA sensing through the cGAS-STING pathway. Further,
innate immune signaling through cGAS-STING has been shown to improve the efficacy of checkpoint blockade.
I propose that loss of cytosolic DNA sensing is permissive for extrachromosomal DNA production, which
promotes tumor progression not only through oncogene amplification but also through impaired innate immune
signaling, limiting immune surveillance and the efficacy of checkpoint blockade. Together, this work will provide
novel insights into immune and tumor dynamics that underlie cancer progression and response to
immunotherapy."
10925591,"American Veterans are disproportionately affected by kidney-damaging agents during
deployment operations, and failing health and medical countermeasures add long-term health
effects. Studies admit the urgent need to develop novel protective or preventive strategies to
overcome the short therapeutic window for kidney protection. Thus, a therapy based on the
delayed effects of acute kidney injury (AKI) would be clinically relevant because it gives a wider
therapeutic window for intervention. The study of kidney nucleases initiated by our group
several years ago has determined that of nine known endonucleases, DNase I and EndoG are
the most active and mechanistically involved in tubular epithelial cell death during AKI. Our
unexpected finding was that one of the endonucleases, EndoG, that has RNase activity,
induced alternative splicing (AS) of DNase I pre-mRNA, thus inactivating DNase I and mitigating
other DNases’ expression. Our data also showed that EndoG indices AS of other genes.
Therefore, this proposal is focused on EndoG-mediated pathways through its RNase and
DNase activities. We hypothesize that during AKI, EndoG induces tubular epithelial cell death
by fragmenting DNA and causing alternative pre-mRNA splicing of several proteins including
DNase I, while endonuclease inhibitors will mitigate this injury. In Aim 1 we will determine
EndoG RNase-mediated mechanisms in normal kidney and during myoglobinuric AKI. This aim
will determine (a) the protective mechanisms of EndoG against DNase I expression, and (b) the
mechanism of AS mediated by EndoG. Aim 2 will define the role of EndoG DNase activity, the
mechanisms of EndoG and DNase I leakage to the nucleus, and the role of ROS in the
induction of endonucleases during myoglobinuric AKI. Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate the
therapeutic modulation of EndoG for kidney tissue protection and limiting AS in myoglobinuric
and other AKI models. Inhibition of individual endonucleases with the use of our one-of-a-kind
chemical inhibitors will be tested.
 Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care. The results of this study will benefit American
Veterans and the general population by providing critical knowledge of endonuclease-mediated
mechanisms of AKI and their therapeutic targeting. These studies can potentially lead to the
development of new therapeutic tools (endonuclease inhibitors) to prevent or ameliorate
myoglobinuric AKI. Some of them will have strong translational value because they act even if
administered after kidney injury, while others can become future therapeutic options. When
applied to humans, the results of this study may allow for saving human lives, improving the
health of Veterans, and decreasing the number of disabilities in the Veteran population."

some sub-populations (e.g., gay and bisexual men) are extremely limited. Furthermore, few studies have
examined the risk and protective factors that may explain these disparities, or LGBT Veterans’ experiences
with and preferences for treatment.
Objectives: The objectives of this study are to: 1) identify the extent of sexual orientation and gender identity
disparities in mental health problems (depression, PTSD, anxiety, suicide ideation/attempt) and health risk

heterosexual men, gay men, bisexual men, transgender women, and transgender men. All Veterans will be
recruited through online social networking sites and advertisements to online groups. Targeted advertisements
will be used to recruit Veterans from sexual orientation and gender identity subgroups. Study assessments will
also be conducted online to increase study reach and retention, with measures collected every nine months for

10924921,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dr. Glenda Baguso’s long-term goal is to be a high-impact, NIH-funded, independent investigator with
expertise working with marginalized communities at risk for HIV. Transgender (trans) women are
disproportionately burdened by HIV, yet have lower engagement in HIV prevention and HIV care compared
to other affected populations. To end the HIV epidemic, interventions are needed that address psychosocial
and structural factors that impact engagement in HIV care, such as trauma. The goal of the K23 is to address
trauma to improve HIV prevention and care engagement in community clinics that provide care to trans
women. This proposal uses three aims to achieve this goal. The first aim is to explore the relationship between
trauma, mental health, HIV prevention and care engagement, and the multi-level intersectional factors among
trans women using in-depth interviews with 20 trans women. The second aim is to examine barriers and
facilitators to implementing T-SBIRT, a trauma screener, brief intervention, and referral to treatment in
community clinics using in-depth interviews with 20 clinic stakeholders (e.g., leadership, health care providers,
staff). The third aim is to pilot test T-SBIRT with 50 trans women in a community clinic to assess
implementation outcomes. The implementation of T-SBIRT in a community clinic that provides care to trans
women will be guided by a modified intersectionality-enhanced Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research. These specific aims will be achieved by the following training aims: 1) develop content expertise
on trauma stressors, T-SBIRT and mental health, 2) gain intersectional methodological expertise and
advanced skills in clinical trials and intervention development, and 3) develop knowledge and skills for
implementation science. The training aims are supported by Dr. Baguso’s mentoring team of experts in
trauma, mental health, intersectionality, and implementation science. With support from her mentors, UCSF,
and the department chair of the Department of Community Health Systems in the School of Nursing, Dr.
Baguso will successfully meet the training aims, complete the specific aims, and be fully equipped to launch
her NIH independent investigator career."

As the California Cancer Consortium (CCC), four National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Centers 
propose to participate in the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) to conduct early 
phase clinical trials of experimental therapeutics. The CCC comprises City of Hope (COH, Lead Academic 
Organization [LAO]), the University of Southern California (USC, Affiliated Organization [AO]), the University of 
California, Davis (UCD, AO), and Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI, AO), and has a 25-year history as a 
multidisciplinary group conducting early phase clinical trials of NCI-sponsored investigational new drugs under 
previous U01 and UM1 Cooperative Agreements and N01 Contracts. Our multidisciplinary group of investigators 
will contribute to ETCTN Project Teams by leveraging the combined expertise of COH, UCD, USC, and SCI in 
molecular pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, signal transduction, cell 
cycle regulation, non-invasive imaging, and bioinformatics to conduct innovative, laboratory-directed early phase 
developmental and pharmacokinetic studies. We propose to use the combined patient and scientific resources 
and expertise of UCD, COH, USC, and SCI to accomplish the following Specific Aims: (Aim 1) to use the 
existing relevant capabilities and scientific leadership of the CCC to enhance the ETCTN program; (Aim 2) to 
leverage the combined breadth of the clinical programs at COH, USC, UCD, and SCI NCI-Designated 
Comprehensive Cancer Centers to support the rapid completion of ETCTN trials; (Aim 3) to use the central Data 
Coordinating Center (DCC) and Biostatistics Core (BC) at COH to facilitate frequent communication within the 
CCC and with the NCI and ETCTN, provide rapid development and effective oversight of trials, and ensure 
adherence to policies and procedures; and (Aim 4) to optimize information gained from ETCTN clinical trials by 
including molecular characterization of patients’ malignancies and incorporating molecular pharmacodynamic 
endpoints and investigational imaging. These early phase studies will lead to recommended, biologically effective 
doses, greater understanding of the spectrum of normal tissue toxicity of agents, and initial estimates of efficacy. 
They will also provide mechanistic validation of the effects of the agents on critical tumor cell targets, correlate 
drug-related changes in tumor and host biologic markers with clinical outcome, and develop new insights into 
the therapeutic mechanisms of action of the compounds both in the laboratory and the clinic. As such, they will 
advance the ETCTN’s overall goal of accelerating the development of novel anticancer agents that capitalize on 
unique molecular features of individual tumors and identifying appropriate biomarkers to select patients who are 
most likely to respond to specific agents."
10923899,"PROJECT SUMMARY − PROJECT 1
 In recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC), immune checkpoint
blockade has changed the standard of care, with trials from HN SPORE PI Dr. Robert Ferris and co-I (Project
2) Dr. Barbara Burtness pioneering the use of anti-PD-1 in this setting. Unfortunately, only a minority of
patients benefit, due to resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, pointing to an urgent need to better understand the
tumor microenvironment. With HN SPORE support, first through a Developmental Research Program award
and later following elevation to Continuing Project 1, we have identified a connection between tumor
metabolism, hypoxia and T cell dysfunction that may be partially driving resistance to anti-PD-1 (Zandberg, et
al, ASCO 2020). To further investigate this question, we are proposing to conduct two newly designed, novel
therapeutic clinical trials within Project 1, in R/M HNSCC naïve to anti-PD-1 (HCC 18-190/NCT04114136) or
progressed on anti-PD-1 (HCC 18-156/NCT04326257). The former is a trial of metabolic modulators and anti-
PD1, the latter a trial of anti-PD-1 combined with either anti-CTLA4 or anti-LAG3. Utilizing these trials and pre-
clinical models of HNSCC, we will examine the following questions. First, what is the relationship between
anti-PD-1 resistance, tumor metabolism and hypoxia in HNSCC? With the assistance of Core B, we will
address this question via multiplexed tissue analysis in R/M HNSCC samples from our clinical trials as well as
radiomics-based approaches of determining tumor hypoxia. Second, does hypoxia promote resistance to
combinatorial immunotherapy in HNSCC? We will test how hypoxia may impede immunotherapy with
nivolumab plus relatlimab (anti-LAG3), or ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) in R/M HNSCC patients who have
progressed on anti-PD-1, evaluating tissue before and after therapy. Third, can metabolically targeted therapy
be combined with anti-PD-1 to overcome anti-PD1 resistance in HNSCC? We will evaluate tumor samples
obtained before and after treatment with anti-PD-1 plus either metformin or rosiglitazone and determine
changes in tumor metabolism and hypoxia. We will also test combinatorial immunotherapy (as in Aim 2) with
metabolic modulation in pre-clinical HNSCC models rendered anti-PD1 resistant. Our trial of metabolic
inhibitors combined with anti-PD1 therapy, if positive, will directly lead to larger scale clinical studies, opening
up an entirely novel avenue of combinatorial immunotherapy; while the project as a whole will also provide a
platform for developing future personalized immunotherapy trials by adding metabolic analysis and/or
modulation as a component."
10923902,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
 Human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) oropharynx cancer (OPC) is a national and global health issue.
Because HPV+ OPC has very good survival outcomes, the long-term toxicity of current treatment, typically
combined chemotherapy and radiation (CRT) is devastating. Trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS), a surgical
technique pioneered by Dr. Ferris and others, has been studied to reduce toxicity of HPV+ OPC treatment,
culminating in ECOG 3311, a prospective trial of TORS followed by risk-adapted adjuvant therapy depending
on tumor and nodal pathology. Despite excellent survival in this trial (ASCO 2020, Abstract #6500), slightly
over 30% of patients were found to have high risk neck disease (HRND), characterized by gross extranodal
extension (ENE, >1mm) or ≥5 positive lymph nodes, which mandated the use of adjuvant, high dose CRT, an
intensification of treatment where de-intensification is the goal. However, as ~70% of patients were candidates
for de-intensification, interest remains high in TORS as a strategy, particularly if patients with HRND can be
identified prior to surgery. To this end, and with the assistance of Core A and Core B we have identified 40
patients from ECOG 3311 enrolled from HCC (as the highest accruing site) and comprehensively genomically,
transcriptomically and radiomically profiled their tumors. This preliminary data allowed us to generate a four-
gene mutational signature present in ~80% of patients with HRND, with similar findings in the Head and Neck
cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Additionally, we observed a profound immune repression in tumors
from patients with HRND. In this Project we expand our analysis to an additional 200 HPV+ OPC patients we
have identified in the organ specific database (OSD in Core A) for which tissue is already available (Core B)
and then validate our signature in over 200 additional tumors from ECOG 3311. Additionally, we plan to
recapitulate the mutations from our signature, as well as others identified by our co-I Dr. Burtness, which
appear to be associated with immune infiltrate in HPV+ OPC, in pre-clinical models to identify potential drivers
of immune infiltrate. Finally, to address the management of HRND, we will conduct a clinical trial HCC 18-034
(PI: Ferris) designed for this SPORE project examining the combination of TORS, lower dose RT and anti-PD-
1 therapy in patients with HRND to improve toxicity and quality of life compared to chemoradiation in both a
newly added control arm based on reviewer feedback as well as ECOG 3311. The effect of tumor mutation,
immune infiltrate, and peripheral blood IFN signature on outcome in this trial will also be examined.
 Success of this project will produce: 1) a validated and immediately applicable predictive signature for
HRND; 2) an explanation for the repressed immune infiltrate seen with HRND; 3) quality of life/toxicity
comparisons and biologic correlatives from a novel deintensification trial in HRND."
10923903,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
 Although great strides have been made with immunotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), there is a strong imperative to [i] gain a better understanding of the mechanism(s) of action for
current standard-of-care (SOC) immunotherapies (e.g. anti-PD1) and novel immunotherapeutic treatments in
clinical trials (e.g. anti-LAG3); [ii] determine biomarkers of responsiveness that could predict patient outcomes
to immunotherapy; and [iii] determine if there are mechanisms of resistance that can be overcome. Tumor-
specific inhibitory mechanisms, such as inhibitory receptors (IRs), represent major obstacles to effective anti-
tumor immunity, highlighting the importance of understanding their cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms and
optimal combinations to improve immunotherapies. Although LAG3 is the third ‘checkpoint’ to be targeted with
>10 agents in clinical trials, we still know very little about how LAG3 blockade, alone or with anti-PD1, impacts
the immune response to HNSCC. Our over-arching hypothesis is that LAG3/PD1 dual blockade synergizes to
promote CD8+ T cell function in the tumor and peripheral blood (PBL) of HNSCC patients, and a LAG3-
dominant IR module in peripheral CD8+ T cells downregulates T cell function, and ultimately, patient response
to PD1-targeted therapy. We ask two major questions in this area. What is the mechanism of anti-PD1 (nivo)
and anti-LAG3 (rela) on the anti-tumor function of CD8+ T cells? We are accruing to a novel neoadjuvant
window trial which randomizes treatment-naïve locally advanced HNSCC patients to two arms relevant to this
Aim: [i] nivo monotherapy, or [ii] nivo plus rela, followed by surgery after initiation of treatment. We hypothesize
that T cell activation and proliferation pathways are differentially regulated by anti-PD1 vs. anti-LAG3 in CD8+ T
cells, and that unique synergistic molecular programs will be revealed by this immunotherapeutic combination
in treatment-naïve patients with HNSCC. Secondly, we ask whether cytokines drive a LAG3-dominant IR
module in peripheral, naive CD8+ T cells and does it predict responsiveness to immunotherapy? We recently
made a series of novel findings regarding IR expression in peripheral CD8+ T cells implying a novel
mechanism of immune resistance. We hypothesize that cytokine-driven systemic immune dysfunction and
subsequent resistance to anti-PD1 therapy is driven by a LAG3-dominant IR module, and that this dysfunction
can be ameliorated by anti-LAG3+PD1 blockade. This project will [i] define biomarkers of response and
resistance to nivo and nivo/rela, [ii] potentially identify a patient population that will optimally benefit from
LAG3-based therapies, and [iii] lead to the development novel combinatorial immunotherapy trials of increased
efficacy in HNSCC."
10918617,"Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes is more common among Veterans than the general population and leads
to decreased muscle strength and increased muscle fatigue, contributing to impaired recovery from illness and
disability. Many other veterans have Type 1 diabetes that contributes to muscle weakness even with
reasonable glycemic control. These changes are also seen in aging and both conditions are associated with
mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle, but the signals that control mitochondrial metabolism in muscle during
diabetes and aging remain incompletely understood. We recently reported that mouse models of
streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes or aging cause muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction, which both
depend on FoxO transcription factor activation. FoxO activation in STZ diabetic muscle represses nuclear-
encoded mitochondrial gene transcription, particularly OXPHOS complex I subunits, and can be prevented by
deletion of FoxOs in muscle. Since inhibition of FoxOs in non-muscle tissues can lead to cancer, defining the
muscle-specific FoxO protein interactions that lead to improved muscle mitochondrial function in diabetes or
aging are critical to improve the treatment of muscle weakness. We have preliminary data demonstrating that
FoxOs and Sin3a corepressors are co-localized on OXPHOS promoters and that FoxO or Sin3a
overexpression can repress many complex I subunit genes. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role
of FoxO interacting proteins in muscle mitochondrial function and muscle fatigue in the context of uncontrolled
diabetes or aging. To accomplish the goals of this project we propose 2 aims: Aim 1 will determine the
contribution of FoxO-Sin3 interactions to repression of Complex I (CI) and mitochondrial dysfunction in
diabetes; Aim 2 will determine the molecular interactions with FoxOs that contribute to repression of
mitochondrial function and muscle fatigue in aging. Our long-term goals are to understand the role of FoxOs
and FoxO-target genes in diabetes-induced defects of mitochondrial energy production in muscle to gain
insights into the metabolic changes that can contribute to decreased strength, increased fatigue and ultimately
lead to disability which is so common in our Veteran population."

and clinical diagnostics. Saliva is a readily available sample type that contains over a billion microbes per mL,
but the signal from low abundance microbes and correct species identification can be difficult to detect without
deep, expensive shotgun metagenomic sequencing. qPCR-based molecular detection can overcome the
limitations of NGS methods by offering specificity, sensitivity, and quantification down to single digit copy

create a new generation of qPCR assays. Our new method combines cutting-edge knowledge of genomic
databases and microbial evolution within a proprietary software suite that enables the rapid and accurate
design of discriminatory primers and probes capable of detecting target microorganisms without
cross-reactivity. We have de-risked the underlying software suite, established in silico and in vitro validation
methods, and successfully demonstrated a proof-of-concept panel consisting of 106 validated qPCR assays
with high specificity and sensitivity of microbial targets in complex samples. In this Phase 1 proposal, we plan
to develop a comprehensive oral qPCR panel through the following aims: (1) determine oral panel targets by
ascertaining abundance and prevalent microbes in the oral microbiome from 926 public metagenomic samples
studying six different disease phenotypes; and (2) design and validate qPCR assays targeting the identified
microbes. A comprehensive qPCR panel of oral species creates a cost-effective research tool that does not
require expensive pre- and post-processing steps associated with NGS techniques and can quantify all the
Bacteria and Archaea commonly present in the human oral cavity. This panel will provide researchers and
clinicians with an alternative to NGS techniques and enable large-scale cohort and/or detailed longitudinal
studies for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response. Successful completion of this Phase 1
proposal will result in the (1) identification of microbial targets and (2) demonstrate validated qPCR assays that
accurately screen the oral microbiome. This work will precede a Phase 2 proposal that quantifies the
advantages of generating a microbiome profile with our oral comprehensive panel compared to NGS, such as
lower cost, faster turnaround time, superior detection, and quantitative values. Our novel platform technology
enables a new, comprehensive, and cost-effective approach for discovering and leveraging microbial
biomarkers for clinical research and sets the stage for the future development of microbiome-based monitoring
platforms, screening tests, and diagnostics."

 COVID-19 may have negatively impacted efforts aimed at EHE and exacerbated disparities in HIV
outcomes. For EHE to be successful, it is important to understand any lasting impacts that adversely
complicate HIV control and impact care of people with HIV (PWH), and to address structural issues at the root
of disparities during and after an overlapping pandemic. The impact of post COVID conditions (PCC) PCC on
HIV outcomes has not been studied. While PCC has been documented to increase incident comorbidities and
complications, data on the epidemiology of PCC are lacking for PWH. It is critical to understand
epidemiological risk and any long-term increases in comorbidities among PWH due to SARS-CoV-2 to inform
care and support. The goal of the proposed study is to understand the clinical and social factors that impact
HIV and COVID-19 outcomes among PWH and to characterize how the COVID-19 pandemic, including PCC,
may influence HIV care outcomes. This research will leverage established cohorts: 1) clinical cohorts of PWH
and PWoH from the Johns Hopkins Healthcare System and Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States and 2) the
CHASING COVID Cohort, an online community-based cohort of US adults.
 The proposed research poses unique methodological challenges due to the varying definitions of PCC, the
quantity of exposure data and the longitudinal design, all of which may increase measurement error. This K01
will provide experience, knowledge and training in methods (advanced biostatistics methods related to
improving inferences in settings with complex exposure pathways and measurement error) and content
(comorbidity development among PWH, including PCC, and social determinants of health). The study aims to:
(1) compare clinical risk factors for PCC-related comorbidities by HIV status using target trial approaches with
marginal structural models for time-varying confounding and outcome censoring; (2) characterize the role of
social determinants of PCC-related comorbidities by HIV status using multi-level models; and (3) assess the
role of COVID-era factors on disparities in HIV outcomes, using a novel mediation approach in combination
with modern approaches for minimizing bias (e.g., potential-mediator weighted models).
 Focusing the research, in part, on PCC will provide an opportunity to address a complicated and multi-
faceted problem lacking robust epidemiological data for PWH. Findings from the proposed study are critical to
understanding the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on HIV outcomes, disparities in HIV and COVID outcomes,
the epidemiology and natural history of PCC within an immunocompromised population, and pandemic
preparedness for PWH and EHE. Other innovations include: 1) triangulating electronic health record data with
reported data from one of the few national-community-based cohorts and 2) improving inference by
incorporating advanced design and methods with clinical insight. Furthermore, the focus on clinical and social
pathways is critical for identifying the next generation of HIV interventions for EHE."

10922231,"ABSTRACT:
Fibrotic disorders represent a major health problem in the U.S, with a rising incidence (particularly among the
elderly). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentless and fatal fibrotic disease, characterized by progressive
scar tissue formation in the lungs, resulting respiratory failure. There are two FDA-approved treatments for IPF,
which slow but do not stop the decline in lung function, and only have a modest survival benefit. Improved
therapies for IPF and other fibrotic diseases are needed to improve patient quality of life and outcomes. We were
the first to identify Nox4 (an oxidant generating enzyme) as a critical mediator of lung fibrosis. Nox4 is now
considered to be a core pathway that mediates fibrosis in various organs (lungs, liver, skin, kidney, blood vessels,
skeletal muscle, and heart). We have also demonstrated that Nox4 becomes dysfunctional in aging, where its
sustained upregulation promotes age-associated persistent/progressive fibrosis – These findings may help to
explain why fibrotic disorders develop are more prevalent among the elderly. Although Nox4 is among the most
promising drug targets for fibrotic disease, selective Nox4 inhibitors have yet to be successfully developed – until
now. This direct to Phase II SBIR application is a collaboration between biotech startup company Fibronox LLC
and Emory University. We have pioneered the development of first-in-class selective Nox4 inhibitor drug
candidates; 10 patents filed. Our Nox4 inhibitors have passed a rigorous screening cascade, including nM
potency in vitro for inhibiting TGFb-induced pro-fibrotic effects and reversing IPF myofibroblast phenotypes.
Importantly, therapeutic treatment with Nox4 inhibitor candidates in vivo led to protection from the development
of fibrosis and promoted the resolution of age-associated established fibrosis. Further, inhaled delivery of Nox4
inhibitors demonstrated efficacy at a dose ~7-fold lower than orally administered and 4-fold increased drug
exposure in the lung. The goal of the proposed studies is to perform side-by-side evaluation of our top 3 most
promising candidates via inhaled delivery in order to identify one development candidate for IND-enabling studies
and subsequent clinical development. Aim 1 will rigorously validate top candidates for selectivity and mode of
action. Aim 2 will de-risk top candidates through advanced screening, including the use of human precision cut
lung slices, single-cell RNAseq, and highly a innovative bioinformatic approach to evaluate Nox4 inhibitors vs.
standard of care. Aim 3 will evaluate specificity and potential for adverse effects. Aim 4 will determine the
therapeutic index and maximum tolerated dose. To date, no therapeutics have been shown to reverse age-
associated established fibrosis, which may represent the holy grail for therapeutic strategies to more effectively
treat IPF. We hypothesize that therapeutic strategies targeting age-associated pathologic mechanisms (ex. age-
dependent sustained Nox4/ROS levels) offer the greatest potential for developing successful IPF treatments."
10915450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another
country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible
in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired
perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current
methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A
more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited
number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both
auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well.
Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances
in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition.
The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human
psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will
ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health
and illness."
10915646,"Project Summary
Metastasis, the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor to secondary sites, is the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality. Although chemotherapy improves overall survival in early breast cancer, it does not
provide definite cure for metastasis. Paradoxically, chemotherapy induces pro-metastatic changes in the tumor
microenvironment if given in the pre-operative (neo-adjuvant) setting. These pro-metastatic changes are
primarily initiated via infiltration of tumors by pro-angiogenic Tie2Hi macrophages, which are essential
components of cancer cell intravasation sites called Tumor MicroEnvironment of Metastasis (TMEM). Only
invasive and migratory cancer cell expressing MenaINV can disseminate via TMEM. In mouse mammary
carcinoma and patient derived xenografts, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy increases (i) TMEM assembly, (ii) the
density of cancer cells expressing MenaINV, (iii) the number of circulating tumor cells, and (iv) lung metastases.
This proposal will elucidate molecular mechanisms by which chemotherapy exerts these pro-metastatic
changes in the breast tumor microenviroment, so that predictive biomarkers and targetable signaling pathways
of “chemotherapy-induced metastasis” can be identified. We hypothesize that macrophages recruited to
tumors upon neo-adjuvant chemotherapy educate tumor cells not only to become dissemination-competent by
inducing MenaINV expression through juxtacrine interactions, but also to obtain tumor-initiating capabilities
responsible for tumor growth initiation at distant sites. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether macrophage-cancer
cell interaction is required for induction of MenaINV and MenaINV-mediated pro-metastatic phenotypes upon
treatment with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. This will be accomplished using established macrophage depletion
studies in vivo, coupled with advanced microscopy. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether breast tumor cells
expressing MenaINV-Hi also harbor stem cell capabilities. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing a fluorescent stem cell
reporter (SORE6) will be used to generate xenografts for multiphoton intravital imaging microscopy and fixed-
tissue multichannel immune-fluorescent microscopy and study the effects of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on
tumor cell stemness. Aim 3 is designed to unravel the signaling pathways responsible for the aforementioned
pro-metastatic phenotypes. Transgenic and pharmacological inhibition mouse models targeting the relevant
juxtacrine pathways will be developed to eliminate macrophage-tumor cell interactions and study whether
these pathways are instrumental in chemotherapy-induced metastasis. The research environment at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine offers outstanding opportunities for collaborations, scientific discussion and
career development. The proposed studies and career development training coupled with an exceptional team
of Dr. Condeelis, expert in advanced microscopy, Dr. Oktay, physician scientist, Dr. Wakefield a pioneer in
stem cell research, and Dr. Richard Stanley, leader in macrophage biology, will ensure that I achieve my goal
of establishing a successful, independently-funded lab at a major university."
10915532,"ABSTRACT
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is a disease primarily afflicting geriatric patients as evidenced by the fact
that 80% of all non-melanoma skin cancers are diagnosed in patients over the age of 60 years. As such,
geriatric skin responds to cancer-inducing ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in a manner that allows the
establishment of tumor cells. While the correlation between aged epidermis and skin cancer is obvious, the
mechanism responsible for this relationship remains obscure. Recent in vitro evidence as well as
epidemiological data suggests one possible mechanism may involve alterations in the insulin-like growth
factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling network. Using normal human keratinocytes grown in vitro, activated IGF-
1Rs protect keratinocytes from UVB-induced apoptosis; however, while UVB-irradiated keratinocytes with
activated IGF-1Rs survive, they are incapable of further cellular replication, in fact they are senescent. The
critically important observation was that in the absence of IGF-1R activation, keratinocytes are more sensitive
to UVB-induced apoptosis, but the keratinocytes that do survive retain the capacity to proliferate. In the skin,
keratinocytes express the IGF-1R but they do not synthesize IGF-1. Dermal fibroblasts support the proliferation
of keratinocytes in the epidermis by secreting IGF-1. Interestingly, as dermal fibroblasts age, their capacity to
produce IGF-1 is severely diminished; therefore, in aged skin keratinocytes are provided with a reduced supply
of IGF-1 and a concomitant reduction in IGF-1R activation. We have demonstrated that geriatric skin responds
to UVB irradiation in a manner that could lead to initiated carcinogenic keratinocytes. This inappropriate UVB
response can be corrected by treatment with exogenous IGF-1. Furthermore, we have shown that treatment of
geriatric skin with non-ablative dermal rejuvenation therapies can re-establish youthful IGF-1 levels and
subsequently reinstate the appropriate UVB response on geriatric skin. Moreover, we have demonstrated this
protection to acute UVB exposure is durable for up to two years. In this proposal, we will continue and expand
our ongoing clinical trials on the prophylactic effect of non-ablative wounding therapies to both treat and
prevent UVB-induced skin cancer. In particular, we will recruit post-menopausal females for these studies as
this is an underserved population for skin cancer studies. A novel non-invasive mesoscopic imaging platform
will be used to monitor actinic neoplasia progression. In addition, we will examine the mechanisms responsible
for the ability of non-ablative wounding therapies to increase fibroblast-associated IGF-1 expression. These
studies will have a major impact on the treatment of NMSC by establishing a novel anti-carcinogenic role for
dermal wounding. Furthermore, the data from these studies will confirm a new paradigm defining the
mechanism of age-associated skin cancer. Outcomes for these studies include novel therapeutic strategies as
well as non-invasive imaging platforms to monitor field carcinogenesis in at risk-populations."
10915540,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Recent large-scale efforts such as the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects have predicted millions of
potential non-coding regulatory elements in the human genome. However, it is not clear how many of them are
truly functional, as the predictions were mainly based on high-throughput genomics assays such as DNase-
Seq or ChIP-Seq for histone modifications and transcription factors. Most of the current studies indirectly
measure enhancer activity through transgenic reporter assays and therefore do not provide insights into the
native chromatin state. Fortunately, recent advances in high-throughput screening methods based on
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology make such functional characterization possible. Another important
layer of gene regulation is the 3D genome organization, which can link the distal enhancers with their target
genes. High-throughput methods based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as Hi-
C, ChIA-PET, HiChIP, and Capture Hi-C) and present an unprecedented opportunity to study higher-order
chromatin structure genome-wide. Despite the recent advances, the complex relationship between chromatin
interactions and gene regulation has just begun to unravel. CTCF and cohesin complex have been shown to
be critical in the formation of chromatin loops and topologically associating domains (TADs), but we know little
of whether there are other important regulators are important for such chromatin interactions.
 Given the aforementioned challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term goal is to
use a combination of high throughput genomic experiments, computational modeling, and functional assays to
address the following two fundamental questions: 1) Identify functional enhancers through high-throughput
assays and study how genetic variants can affect their functions; 2) Identify novel regulators for the formation
of 3D genome organization features. The proposed work will deepen our understanding on how genetic
variants contribute to gene regulation, 3D genome organization, and molecular mechanisms underlying human
diseases."
10918814,"This transformative award application is designed to test an integrative hypothesis about astrocyte
function across the brain while extending the current limits of state-of-the-art technologies in cellular imaging
and spatial transcriptomics. The team of investigators with cellular, molecular, systems,
theoretical/computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering expertise will take a multipronged
approach to test the central hypothesis that astrocytes serve the function of integrating neuromodulator
signals in circuits across the brain.
 Astrocytes are by some accounts the most common cell in the brain. They have been historically
viewed as support cells for neural circuits, but emerging evidence suggests that they are active participants in
circuit functions. This is especially interesting because astrocytes are affected by stress, aging, and many
diseases of the central nervous system. Remarkably, astrocytes express receptors for serotonin,
norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine; the four neuromodulator systems that arise from deep structures
and innervate most brain circuits. These neuromodulator systems have considerable overlapping circuit
functions suggesting that a mechanism for integrating their inputs is important for disambiguating how each
neuromodulator exerts its contribution to the circuit functions. This project will test the possibility that
astrocytes provide such an integrator function.
 The investigators will use state of the arts techniques and develop new ones to test how astrocytes are
affected by neuromodulators and how these effects impact circuit functions and behavior in two brain
systems. In vivo studies will test the hypothesis on a cell population level manipulating each of the
neuromodulator circuits while testing astrocyte responses to all four, circuit physiology, and behavior. Ex vivo
studies will focus on single cell differences in astrocytes by combining functional studies that parallel in vivo
ones. These spatially resolved functional studies will be aligned with spatial single cell transcriptomics
providing gene expression data to parallel functional data at scale. Stress and aging are known to impact
astrocytes and neuromodulator functions and adversely affect many neuropsychiatric diseases. The team will
lastly establish how stress and aging impact the ability of astrocytes to integrate neuromodulator signals using
their cutting edge techniques.
 Completing these ambitious studies will unequivocally test a transformative idea for an
organizing principle around astrocyte function throughout the brain and inform how dysfunction of these
cells can be contributing to diseases of the central nervous system."
10919966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is caused by the sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV),
which infects 14 million women in the US every year and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive
tract. Over 3 million US women are infected with oncogenic types of HPV that most commonly lead to CIN, and
up to 1 million women are diagnosed with CIN each year in the US. CIN is a precancerous lesion that, if left
untreated, can develop into cervical cancer. There are about 604,000 new cervical cancer cases and over
342,000 attributable deaths in 2020. This constitutes 9% of the global burden of cancer among women. Despite
improvements in screening and vaccination, the rates of cervical cancer have increased globally by 45% in the
last 30 years. Current treatment strategies against CIN are defined by the World Health Organization and include
both ablative (cryotherapy) and excisional (loop electrosurgical excision and cold knife conization) procedures.
While both have proven beneficial in treating CIN, they are associated with different limitations: cryotherapy lacks
effectiveness and is limited because of the logistic constraints associated with gas cost, procurement, and
storage; excisional procedures carry the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes. The need for capital equipment and
the shortage of providers with the skills to use it, result in up to 80% of women diagnosed with CIN never receiving
the recommended treatment. This issue of undertreatment also specifically affects black women in the US. There
is thus, an unmet need for a simple, effective, and affordable technology capable of deploying treatment
at point-of-care as soon as the woman is diagnosed with CIN. Gynion will address this unmet need with the
Clarablex™ gel which is formulated with Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) as the active ingredient and indicated for the
destruction of oncogenic HPV and CIN. Clarablex does not require capital equipment. It will be provided in
prefilled syringe cartridges and will be available for immediate use at any cervical cancer screening facility. TCA
has been successfully used as a low-viscosity “water-like” solution in clinical trials as a chemical ablative agent
against CIN lesions. Clarablex has an improved proprietary formulation that has a gel-like viscosity, enabling
precise application to the target tissue and predictable ablation depth. This improves efficacy, enhances safety,
prevents accidental spillage and damage to healthy tissue, and simplifies the procedure. The formulation is
delivered with a single-use applicator that safely applies Clarablex topically on the surface of the cervix and
chemically destroys neoplastic lesions during a quick 10-minute procedure. The treatment has a cost of goods
of less than $10 per treatment. Preliminary research demonstrates the ability of the Clarablex to ablate cervical
tissues up to 7-8 mm penetration, which is expected to be sufficient to treat even high-grade CIN lesions. The
proposed SBIR Phase I study will focus on developing the cervical applicator, refinement of the gel formulation
with optimized flow characteristics, and conducting ex vivo exposure studies on human uteri to demonstrate the
potential effectiveness. Phase II project will assess the toxicologic and clinical safety of Clarablex."

Starlight Cardiovascular is developing what will be the first FDA approved percutaneous flow restrictor to replace
surgical banding in congenital heart disease (CHD). Many babies with CHDs such as Hypoplastic Left Heart
Syndrome and communicating heart defects have overcirculation to the lower-resistance pulmonary bed and
undercirculation to the rest of the body. Reducing pulmonary artery flow in these babies creates a more
physiologic balance between pulmonary and systemic circulations and allows them to survive the first few weeks
of life, reduces damage to their pulmonary arteries, and enables them to grow larger and stronger prior to their
next, more invasive surgery to repair their heart defect.
Currently, the reduction of pulmonary blood flow in these neonatal patients is achieved by surgical pulmonary
artery banding, but banding requires an open-chest surgery and can interfere with pulmonary artery growth, thus
limiting its clinical utility. A percutaneous solution could eliminate an open chest surgery for a newborn. Pediatric
interventional cardiologists have so much interest in overcoming the negative effects of banding that they are
perforating vascular plugs to create hand-made percutaneous pulmonary flow restrictors, and early clinical use
of these devices have produced promising results. However, use of these modified vascular plugs is limited by
technical challenges such as long implant lengths, device migration, and lack of adjustability and reliability.
Additionally, many clinicians are uncomfortable with modifying an occluder by hand and using it off-label.
Starlight Cardiovascular is developing a catheter-delivered, percutaneous, and adjustable branch pulmonary
artery blood flow restrictor to replace surgical banding. Our device addresses the shortcomings from previous
attempts at a percutaneous flow restrictor by providing reliable flow reduction, percutaneous adjustability, and a
short and well-anchored implant design that is removable. These pulmonary flow restrictors could benefit as
many as 130,000 babies born each year with CHDs including Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, Ventricular
Septal Defects, and Truncus Arteriosus.
This Phase II SBIR grant will consist of device design optimization through design iteration, benchtop testing,
end-user simulated use testing by pediatric interventional cardiologists, and acute and chronic animal studies.
Successful completion of this project will produce a final device design that is ready for formal Verification and
Validation testing, clinical studies, FDA approval, and commercialization."

Antibiotic resistance is becoming a major public health problem worldwide, with antibiotic resistant pathogens
infecting hundreds of millions and killing over a million patients worldwide each year. Infections such as
pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning, gonorrhoea, and foodborne diseases are becoming harder or
impossible to treat with the existing medicine. Majority of antibiotics currently in clinical use are natural products
or their derivatives. However, recently discovery of natural products with novel mechanisms to kill pathogens
have become more challenging due to the high rate of rediscovery of known molecules, as the traditional
technologies only capture the highest abundant molecular products of microbial isolates. The introduction of
modern sequencing technologies and genome mining in early 2000 has revolutionized the field of natural product
discovery. While these technologies have revealed millions of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs, clusters of
genes that encode for natural products) in microbial genomes, currently these methods cannot predict the
precise action of enzymes in BGCs, and therefore fail to correctly predict the final molecular product of BGCs.
Chemia Biosciences is developing technologies to predict the molecular product of these BGCs based on high-
throughput mass spectrometry data collected on extracts of microbial cultures. In the past, the PI and co-PI have
developed techniques for identifying known and discovering novel bacterial natural products by a computational
analysis of mass spectrometry data. The main goal of this proposal is to develop methods for discovering novel
fungal natural products, a biomedically important class of natural products that include antibacterial penicillin,
antifungal echinocandin, anticancer paclitaxel, immunosuppressant cyclosporin, and cholesterol-lowering
medication lovastatin. The software developed in the course of this proposal will be available to partners as a
cloud service."

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has established itself as an indispensable tool for functional
brain imaging, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution while being non-invasive.
Despite its advantages, current MEG systems based on superconducting quantum interference
devices (SQUIDs) are cost-prohibitive and lack adaptability, particularly for pediatric
populations. This project focuses on the development of a wearable MEG system based on
Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) technology, a novel alternative to traditional SQUID
magnetometers. This innovation eliminates the need for cryogenic cooling, thereby overcoming
significant limitations associated with traditional MEG systems.
Using OPMs has enabled the development of a cost-effective, flexible, and high-resolution MEG
system (OPM-MEG). Our technology aims to match the spatial resolution of invasive techniques
such as Electrocorticography (ECoG), while maintaining the non-invasive nature of traditional
MEG. Additionally, it features a flexible helmet, accommodating individuals of all ages and
allowing for head movement during scanning—an important advancement in neuroimaging
technologies. Building on our successful Phase IIB project, where we developed and deployed
prototype high-density OPM-MEG systems in leading neuroscience laboratories, the current
project aims to finalize the essential steps for the commercialization of this groundbreaking
technology."

Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI), where electron spins are the subject of the investigation, is a
promising tool and has the ability to provide maps of multiple tissue microenvironment parameters, such as
partial oxygen pressure (pO2) and pH. However, currently, there is no instrument available that can provide
multi-parametric maps due to very different requirements on the instrument hardware. Current
instrumentation, such as a 25 mT pulse EPRI instrument JIVA-25Ô developed by us, only provides pO2 maps
and does not provide images of other parameters as its hardware does not support the continuous wave (CW)
acquisition methods needed for imaging pH. In the current project, our goal is to develop a multifunctional
imager (MFI) that can perform both pulse and CW acquisition for simultaneous pO2 and pH imaging. Towards
this goal, we will develop a 25 mT Halbach-type permanent magnet (Aim 1), new muli-modal transmit-receive
electronics based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) (Aim 2), and finally, we will build the MFI instrument
(Aim 3). Our long-term goal is to make functional imaging affordable to scientists in biomedical fields to enhance
therapies and understand biology."
10918527,"Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach. The presence of H. pylori
in the stomach is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease. The World Health
Organization has classified H. pylori as a type I carcinogen, and gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related death worldwide. H. pylori genomes contain more than 50 genes that are predicted to encode
outer membrane proteins. Six H. pylori genes encode non-identical OMPs designated as FecA- or FrpB-like
proteins. These six proteins are predicted to function as TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs). TBDTs are outer
membrane proteins that bind and transport substrates through the outer membrane, using an energy-dependent
process requiring an inner membrane complex (TonB-ExbB-ExbD) that transduces energy (proton motive force)
to the outer membrane. Relatively little experimental work has been done to analyze the functions of the six
putative H. pylori TBDTs, but one is reported to have a role in nickel acquisition. In preliminary studies, we have
mutated H. pylori genes encoding each of the six putative TBDTs and genes encoding each of two non-identical
TonB proteins. Our preliminary experimental results confirm that one of the TBDTs (FrpB3) has a role in nickel
acquisition and support our hypothesis that TonB-dependent processes contribute to H. pylori iron acquisition.
In addition, our experimental results indicate that these proteins contribute to H. pylori fitness in vitro. The long-
term goals of this work are to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow H. pylori to persistently colonize
the human gastric mucosa, understand the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection leads to the
development of gastric cancer or peptic ulceration, and develop effective strategies for the prevention of these
diseases. To achieve these long-term goals, we seek to understand the actions of proteins that are localized on
the surface of H. pylori and understand their roles in H. pylori acquisition of essential nutrients. The overall
hypothesis of this proposal is that FecA- and FrpB-like proteins have important roles in H. pylori nutrient metal
acquisition and contribute to H. pylori fitness in vivo, thereby influencing the capacity of H. pylori to colonize the
stomach and cause gastric disease. The specific aims are (i) to define the roles of FecA- and FrpB-like proteins
in H. pylori nutrient acquisition and fitness in vitro, and (ii) to define the roles of FecA- and FrpB-like proteins in
vivo. To accomplish Aim 1, we will further define the roles of FecA- and FrpB-like proteins and TonB proteins in
H. pylori nutrient metal acquisition; systematically analyze the regulation of fecA-like, frpB-like, and tonB genes;
and analyze multiple properties of mutant strains (harboring mutations in fecA-like, frpB-like, or tonB genes)
compared to wild-type and complemented mutant strains. To accomplish Aim 2, we will experimentally infect
Mongolian gerbils and mice with wild-type H. pylori strains, mutant strains (harboring mutations in fecA-like, frpB-
like, or tonB genes), and complemented mutant strains. We will assess the in vivo fitness of the wild-type and
mutant strains under varying conditions, including animals receiving diets containing altered concentrations of
iron or nickel, and we will test the hypothesis that the mutant strains differ from the wild-type strain in capacity to
cause gastric disease. Finally, we will use ICP-MS and laser ablation (LA-ICP-MS) methods to define the effects
of H. pylori on metal concentrations and the spatial distribution of metals in gastric tissue. Collectively, these
experiments will provide an understanding of the functions of FecA- and FrpB-like proteins and TonB-
dependent processes in nutrient metal acquisition, the roles of these proteins in H. pylori colonization
of the stomach, and their roles in gastric disease."
10918584,"Project Summary
 According to the WHO, an estimated 5 million people worldwide receive a diagnosis of epilepsy annually.
Unfortunately, misdiagnosis rates range between 20% to 42%. A false positive leads to inappropriate
treatment with unnecessary antiseizure medication with potential adverse reactions, failure to receive suitable
therapy for the correct diagnosis, and unnecessary restrictions that arise with the stigma of epilepsy. A false
negative comes with increased risks of seizure recurrence, status epilepticus, and premature death. The
diagnosis of epilepsy depends on a comprehensive clinical history, neurological examination, and ancillary
studies including scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Scalp EEG can confirm an epilepsy diagnosis if
abnormalities indicating epilepsy, such as random interictal (between seizure) epileptiform discharges (IEDs) or
focal slow wave activity, are present and detected by visual inspection. However, the sensitivity of abnormalities
being present in the EEG varies from 29-55%, and the ability for clinicians or EEG technicians to detect them by
visual inspection varies. EEG artifacts can both mask IEDs and be mistaken for IEDs. Consequently, it takes
multiple visits, months, or even years to be accurately diagnosed.
 We propose to further develop and validate EpiScalp, a revolutionary EEG analytics algorithm to enhance
diagnostic accuracy. EpiScalp produces a risk score between 0-1 from 10-20 minutes of EEG data and does
not rely on the presence of EEG abnormalities. Instead, our novel algorithm predicts epilepsy in resting-state (no
seizure) brain networks using a dynamic network model. In Phase 1, EpiScalp underwent evaluation on 198
patients with EEGs void of abnormalities during their first visits. An alarming 54% (107) of these patients were
misdiagnosed as having epilepsy when they did not. EpiScalp achieved definitive diagnoses for 168 of 198
patients with low (epilepsy unlikely) and very (epilepsy likely) risk scores, demonstrating remarkable accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity at 93%, 92%, and 95% respectively. EpiScalp could have reduced misdiagnoses from
54% to 17% (a 69% reduction).
 EpiScalp's predictive capabilities extend to patients undergoing long-term EEG monitoring within the
epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). Notably, 30-50% of EMU beds are occupied by non-epileptic patients, resulting
in care delays for those requiring admission due to seizure exacerbation or medically refractory epilepsy needing
surgical evaluation. This issue significantly impacts center efficiency and care quality. Through risk-based patient
triage, EpiScalp improves care quality for epilepsy patients in need and empowers centers to efficiently assess
more potential surgical candidates. This optimization of EMU resources enables timelier treatment for patients.
In Phase 2, we aim to validate EpiScalp through prospective observational studies involving first visit and EMU
patients at 3 renowned epilepsy centers in the US. Additionally, we will assess usability of our tool and develop
a comprehensive regulatory and rollout plan in partnership with experts from DIXI Medical."

We propose a plan for the development of a biobank of human neuroma and intact nerve tissues,
accompanied by a comprehensive set of transcriptomic, proteomic, and histological analyses, to generate
correlations and testable hypotheses on the mechanistic basis for the pain in painful neuromas and the active
biochemical and signaling pathways that may contribute to this phenotype that will be an important tool for the
pain community to identify the exact composition and spatial architecture of painful neuromas and the
identification of those features that uniquely are present only in the presence of pain.
Given that painful neuromas are a major source of peripheral neuropathic pain, and that recent data
increasingly points to immune and glial cells as drivers of the pain by virtue of the signaling molecules that they
produce to act on injured neurons, the data generated may realistically provide important and novel insight into
the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in patients which in turn could lead to the development of new
therapeutic strategies. It is conceivable that the data may reveal that the drivers of pain may change with time
and may be linked to the genotype of patients or coexisting diseases, features which preclinical studies will not
reveal."
10928101,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Data Core)
This U19 Center propose to use human TG/DRG tissue and painful neuromas to generate large-scale multi-
omics datasets for the discovery and characterization of functional genetic elements, epigenetic signatures, and
molecular/cellular pathways that underlie human pain transduction, transmission, and processing. As one of the
key components of the Center, the Data Core aims to act as a data center by building data infrastructure,
providing data management, coordination, analysis, and sharing to the investigators within the Center and other
centers in the community. The projects will generate nearly 4,000 datasets of clinical (pain scores,
demographics), single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, SNP genotyping, spatial transcriptomics from
MERFISH, and physiology for over 1,700 samples from 150 donors.
 The Data Core will first harmonize the datasets and store in centralized MySQL database with accessible
web interface for other cores in the Center. Standard bioinformatics pipelines will be developed to process the
raw data in a systematic manner, including cell type annotation and spatial location in each brain region. The
Data Core will also support the research Projects on their customized analysis, including power analysis,
differential expression and chromatin accessibility across different cell types, brain regions, and diagnosis. It will
also reveal the genetic variants that are associated with various molecular features via xQTL analysis. Last, all
these computed blocks and tools will be integrated into a comprehensive, cloud-based, interactive web portal –
Pain Data Portal, providing a generally useful resource for generating biological hypotheses, discovering
effective diagnosis biomarkers, and developing new treatments for pain. The Data Core will also ensure a timely
data transfer and expertise sharing with the other U19 and U24 centers in the community."

The increasing global prevalence of obesity and its association with diabetes motivate a need for mechanistic
understanding of pathogenesis. Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease with contributions from the control
circuitry of appetite and energy expenditure in the brain and critical endocrine and metabolic signals from
peripheral organs including fat tissue. At the cellular level, dramatic changes in fat cell structure and function are
defining features of obesity, and link obesity to insulin resistance through mediators including leptin, adiponectin,
and proinflammatory lipids and cytokines. While appetite reduction has appropriately received a great deal of
attention in obesity research resulting in the recent approval of multiple GLP1 drugs for obesity, mechanistic
understanding of the contributions of fat tissue and therapeutic progress toward increasing energy expenditure
has had limited success. A major reason for this lack of therapeutic progress is that the pharmaceutical industry
lacks scalable drug discovery tools for testing drugs or determining mechanisms of action in mature human fat
cells. The overarching goal of the current R43 Phase I application is to demonstrate how MelliCell’s proprietary
M3 platform can generate normal and obese-like fat cells that closely mimic ex vivo mature fat cells relative to
immature fat cells derived from the conventional two-dimensional (2D) method. To test this, we collaborate with
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and propose two specific milestones. In Milestone 1, we will compare the
differentiation efficiency, lipid droplet size, insulin sensitivity, cytokine and hormone secretion in ex vivo vs. M3
and 2D vs. M3 fat cells, obtained from the same donor. The results from this aim will quantitatively evaluate the
robustness of M3 technology by displaying phenotypic features and functional readouts like those exhibited by
mature ex vivo fat cells. In Milestone 2, considering the variety of fat-cell derived biomarkers for obesity, we will
use state-of-the-art multiomics to demonstrate the ability of M3 technology to differentiate donors with versus
without obesity. Parameters for testing will include multi-feature imaging, mRNA/protein quantification, endocrine
function, and lipolysis and glucose uptake assays. Common disease associated genetic variants known to be highly
prevalent (for example, CAV1 single nucleotide variants or SNVs) will also be analyzed to further classify
phenotypes in M3 adipocytes. Completion of this Phase I study will establish the generation of a novel fat cell
engineering technology with direct comparison to in vivo tissue for modeling human pathology. Progression to
Phase II will facilitate expanded testing of obesity-linked SNPs to capture donor specific responses to disease
relevant stimuli, enabling the development of therapeutics with potential to reverse the metabolic dysfunction in
fat cells in obesity that leads to insulin resistance and diabetes."
10915907,"Project Summary/Abstract
In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiological agent of
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), is endemic and HIV incidence is high making KS one of the most common cancers in
adults associated with high mortality, even in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. Although oral lesions are
common among AIDS-KS patients, the effects of HIV infection on the oral environment and KSHV reactivation
in the oral cavity before KS development are completely unknown. Using innovative and validated techniques
this study will be the first to test the hypothesis that alterations in the oral environment during HIV infection are
a critical determinant of KSHV reactivation and increased KSHV shedding in the oral cavity. I propose a large
adequately powered longitudinal study of 600 Ugandan adult males and females followed over two years from
three groups: people living with HIV (PLWH) on long term ART, newly diagnosed ART-naïve PLWH, and HIV
uninfected. Participants will be enrolled at the General Population Cohort (GPC) in rural Uganda where KSHV
seroprevalence is among the highest in the world and at The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) and AIDS
Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Uganda Cares, both longstanding HIV care clinics which serve the GPC area.
Oral health examinations will be completed to identify whether PLWH exhibit markers of oral disease including
gingivitis and periodontitis, resulting in increased KSHV reactivation and higher KSHV viral loads in saliva
(shedders). Oral fluids will be collected to identify whether higher oral inflammatory markers, and lower KSHV-
specific IgA are associated with oral KSHV shedding. To capture the role of HIV on changes causing oral
microbiome dysbiosis in the oral cavity and continued effects on oral reactivation and shedding of KSHV, we
will sequence the V1V3 regions of 16s rRNA, which gives high resolution power to differentiate species in the
oral microbiome. The findings produced by this study are truly unique and will be fundamental in identifying
whether markers of oral disease, oral mucosal inflammation, reduced immune control in the oral cavity, and
oral microbiome dysbiosis are factors leading to KSHV reactivation in the oral cavity prior to KS development.
There is an immense gap in the research with regards to the effects of oral health and the oral environment on
KSHV reactivation and KS development. We will incorporate an exceptional multi-disciplinary team of experts
with innovative and validated techniques to collect truly unique data on oral health and oral immune response
indicators from a rural population in SSA. The inventive direction of this proposal combined with the critical
need to identify effects of the oral environment on oral KSHV reactivation and shedding, information needed to
further the field of research on interventions and therapeutics for KS in PLWH, makes my proposal the perfect
fit for this Catalyst award. The information acquired will substantially expand our knowledge of factors driving
KSHV reactivation in the oral cavity before KS pathogenesis which is integral to identifying targets for
interventions against KS development in SSA in addition to other high-risk populations outside of SSA."

The genome of all eukaryotic cells is enclosed by a protective membrane system, the nuclear envelope, which
establishes a selective barrier that ensures the biochemical compartmentalization of nucleus and cytoplasm.
The malfunctioning of this barrier has been observed in many pathological contexts including cancers and
neurodegeneration. The underlying premise of this application is that there are protective mechanisms that
monitor and ameliorate perturbations to the nuclear envelope including to embedded nuclear pore complexes.
Our published work identified the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and integral
inner nuclear membrane proteins as key factors that surveil the integrity of the nuclear envelope barrier. In this
application, we further explore the mechanism of ESCRT function at the nuclear envelope by examining its
function in a new physiological context: the sealing of a single nuclear envelope hole at the end of mitosis in
fission yeast. We propose a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the identity, order of assembly and
copy number of all of the ESCRT proteins recruited to this nuclear envelope sealing site. Our preliminary data
suggest that unique ESCRT proteins (distinct from the complement at endosomes) are recruited in at least two
temporally distinct waves, each of which carries out potentially unique functions to be interrogated in the
proposal. Most notably, as at least some ESCRTs appear dispensable for nuclear envelope sealing but lead to
an expansion of the nuclear envelope hole during mitosis, we hypothesize that ESCRTs form a flexible
grommet that restricts the size of the nuclear envelope hole to counteract forces from the elongating spindle.
To test this model, we will generate tools to measure tension at the nuclear envelope hole and determine a
high resolution structure of ESCRT polymers using cryo-focused ion beam milling coupled to cryo-electron
tomography. The success of the proposal will introduce several new concepts for how ESCRTs function and
inform both physiological and pathological processes associated with nuclear envelope function."
10914503,"Project Summary
Atherosclerosis is initiated and promoted by the arterial accumulation of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing
lipoproteins which activate a chronic inflammatory response. The hepatocyte is the major source of apoB-
lipoprotein particles via its ability to secrete very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which is then hydrolyzed into
intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and then low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. We recently discovered
that a key blood clot lysis protein, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), in hepatocytes limits the production
of apoB-lipoproteins in mice and cultured primary hepatocytes. The overarching goal of the Parent R01 proposal
is to explore the underlying mechanisms by which hepatocyte tPA lowers plasma apoB-containing lipoprotein-
cholesterol levels. Our hypothesis is that hepatocyte tPA limits hepatic VLDL lipidation while increasing apoB-
VLDL intracellular degradation prior to secretion. The therapeutic impact of this proposal is that increasing
hepatocyte tPA in dyslipidemic mice has the potential to reduce atherogenic apoB-lipoproteins and
atherosclerosis without raising the risk of fatty liver disease. Ms. Maya Rodriguez is a research technologist and
a postbac trainee recently graduated from college. She is pursuing a career as a physician scientist and has
been learning research with scientists involved in the Parent R01. We have formed a mentoring team and
developed a thoughtful plan for mentoring her to increase her research capacity and advance her career
development toward her goal as a physician scientist. The PI of the Parent R01, Dr. Ze Zheng will be her primary
mentor, and Dr. Roy Silverstein will serve as her co-mentor. Dr. Wen Dai (Research Scientist) and Hayley Lund
(Lab Manager) will teach and assist Ms. Rodriguez's research. The goal is to teach Ms. Rodriguez how to
contribute intellectually to the research, and to enhance her research skills and knowledge in thrombotic
cardiovascular diseases. We are confident that, with our thoughtful mentoring plan, Maya will become even more
competitive to reach her goal in the next stage of her career, i.e., become a physician scientist through the MSTP
programs. We have developed a feasible research plan based on her interest and experience with a timeline
that can be finished within two years before she goes to medical school and MSTP. Recent studies by Maya and
others in our lab used clinical data analyses and found dyslipidemia is associated with thrombosis and impaired
fibrinolysis in COVID-19, with mechanisms unclear. The original ideas of these clinical studies in COVID-19 were
developed from the parent R01 study that tPA reduces VLDL secretion and tPA directly interacts with apoB (Wen
Dai, et al, Science, 2023, in press). In this supplement award, Ms. Rodriguez proposes to investigate the potential
mechanism by which tPA and PAI1 regulate lipid metabolism with the impact from immunological stimuli. This
will be a logical extension to the Aim 3 of the parent R01, to determine whether increasing hepatocyte tPA in
dyslipidemia reduces atherogenic cholesterol and atherosclerosis, without raising the risk of fatty liver disease."
10925426,"This is the first resubmission of a BLR&D CDA-2 proposal to provide five years of salary support to Brian Sullivan,
M.D. M.H.S., toward his goal of developing an independent VA research career. Dr. Sullivan is an Investigator
at the Durham Cooperative Studies Epidemiology Center (CSPEC), Directory of Quality at the Durham VA
Medical Center, and Assistant Professor at Duke University in the Department of Medicine.
The long-term goal of this CDA is to provide Dr. Sullivan with the training and resources needed to lead a multi-
disciplinary VA research program focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. There is considerable
variability in individual risk of CRC that could impact age at initiation of CRC screening, screening modality
choice, and frequency of follow-up. Yet, guidelines do not recognize this variability, performing too much
colonoscopy screening and surveillance in low risk individuals and not providing enough or timely screening and
surveillance in high-risk individuals. More precise risk stratification based on clinical and genetic factors offers a
promising strategy to improve CRC prevention by targeting colonoscopy resources to individuals at increased
risk for CRC, while reducing the costs and harms of invasive procedures in those at low risk who could undergo
delayed or non-invasive screening. This CDA will leverage powerful VA resources, including linked clinical
repositories and genomic biobanks, to enhance current CRC risk-assessment algorithms with individual-level
information to develop cost-effective and “smarter” CRC risk prediction tools that can guide cancer prevention.
Building on his prior work, Dr. Sullivan's short-term CDA goal is to create an accurate CRC risk prediction tool
based on the clinical and genetic profiles of Veterans to improve CRC risk prediction and better target CRC
screening resources. Specifically, he will establish a CRC risk cohort derived from natural language processing
(NLP)-based phenotype algorithms to more accurately identify cases of CRC and advanced precancerous
lesions in large VA administrative databases, then apply emerging statistical models for longitudinal cohorts that
incorporates clinical information from prior screenings (if available) or other testing to allow informative estimates
of CRC risk over time while taking competing risks of mortality into account (Aim 1). He will then link this database
to the racially diverse Million Veteran Program (MVP) biorepository to test if additional CRC genomic discovery
can bridge disparities and identify those at risk for CRC by creating a trans-ancestry polygenic risk score (Aim
2). Finally, he will augment genetic tools with known longitudinal CRC risk factors to create an accurate CRC
risk prediction tool (Aim 3). This work will support future Merit applications for prospective validation and
implementation studies of this tool. Dr. Sullivan has a team of expert mentors (including Drs. Elizabeth Hauser,
Jason Dominitz, David Lieberman, Samir Gupta, and Andrew Gawron) and consultants (Drs. Hillary Mull, Jason
Vassy, Li Hsu, and Leah Zullig) who are qualified and strongly committed to helping him complete the CDA goals
and become an independent VA investigator through future collaborative research. Together, his team has
designed a career development plan which includes comprehensive training in bioinformatics and large data
acquisition, genomic analysis, and risk prediction. This mentorship, along with the rich Durham-CSPEC
resources, will ensure that Dr. Sullivan has all the support necessary to meet his research and training aims.
In summary, this award will provide Dr. Sullivan critical support for his larger research goal of developing a novel
CRC risk prediction tool based on clinical and genomic biomarkers to better inform individualized CRC prevention
recommendations. Improving CRC risk prediction will be increasingly important as screening and surveillance
access becomes increasingly strained. This tool could both reduce CRC risk and unnecessary health care
utilization by more precisely tailoring these CRC prevention resources. Our results will also provide much needed
information about personalized risk prediction, and thus can also be broadly applicable to other cancer
prevention paradigms, which is something we will explore in future research."
10831105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Loss of O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) expression is common in cancers and confers sensitivity
to DNA alkylators, such as temozolomide (TMZ). Epigenetic silencing of MGMT via promoter hypermethylation
is found in ~50% of glioblastomas (GBMs), and in most lower grade gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/2
(IDH1/2) mutations. MGMT is also silenced in other cancers, including up to 40% of colon cancers, 35% of small
cell lung cancers, and 25% of non-small cell lung cancers. In cells that lack MGMT expression (termed MGMT-cells), TMZ-derived O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) lesions mispair with thymine, during DNA replication, due to
altered hydrogen base pairing, leading to activation of the mismatch repair pathway (MMR). MMR attempts to
repair these lesions by resecting the newly synthesized strand, but thymine once again is inserted opposite of
O6MeG. This reinsertion again triggers MMR, leading to iterative “futile cycles” of DNA repair and ultimately
apoptosis. Clinically, MGMT promoter demethylation is rare, whereas MMR mutations occur frequently as a
dominant mechanism of resistance to TMZ in many tumor types. Because MGMT silencing is found in many
cancers, DNA lesions that overcome the MMR resistance (while still being resolvable by MGMT, so as to
maintain a therapeutic index (TI)) will have a broad impact. Furthermore, as this biomarker persists even in the
treatment-refractory setting (i.e., in the context of MMR defects), we argue that loss of MGMT expression has
not been fully exploited for therapeutic gain. Based on the findings presented above, we seek to develop a new
class of agents discovered in the laboratory of Drs. Ranjit Bindra and Seth Herzon that generate O6MeG lesions 
that are susceptible to MGMT removal (“MGMT dependent”) in healthy cells, but which can overcome MMR 
resistance (“MMR independent”). To this end, Drs. Bindra and Herzon have co-founded KL50 Therapeutics, LLC,
and their studies lead to the identification of KL50, a novel alkylation agent that is more active against MMR- cell
lines than MMR+ cell lines, while retaining MGMT resolvability. This molecule demonstrates exquisite sensitivity 
in MGMT-deficient cells independent of MMR status, with negligible activity in MGMT-proficient cells, and has a 
TI approximately 30 times greater than TMZ. Building on these achievements, in this fast-track SBIR project, we 
propose to conduct lead optimization to improve central nervous system (CNS) penetration, identify a collection 
of small molecules with in vivo efficacy in mouse models of high-grade gliomas (HGG), and further develop these
compounds for use in a Phase 1 clinical trial. These MGMT dependent–MMR independent alkylating agents are 
anticipated to possess the positive attributes of TMZ, while circumventing the unavoidable MMR loss mediated 
resistance mechanism and, thereby, have a major impact on the way we treat GBMs and other tumors lacking
MGMT. These molecules could represent a paradigm shift in oncology by dramatically improving their
therapeutic index. If successful, our approach will significantly increase the safety and efficacy of DNA alkylators
and will expand their use for a broader range of recurrent gliomas and many other cancers."

Oral cancer (OC) is an underserved disease, which is often overlooked by the medical community. Yet it is the 6th most 
common and deadliest cancer in the world. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, over 90% of all oral cancers are oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) - a common subset of head and neck cancers. OC claims the life of one American every 
hour of each day. Additionally, it is on the rise due to the increasing prevalence of oral human papilloma virus (HPV). 
Overall, OC has a 60% survival rate after 5-year remission target, with recurrence being an important prognostic factor. 
Data shows a high correlation between OC risks and low socioeconomic, as well as risk factors related to lifestyle. Even in 
the clinical settings of industrialized nations, such as the United States (US), many patients receive suboptimal care for 
OSCC due to limited resources. Although targeted agents (i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and immunotherapy (i.e., 
checkpoint inhibitors) have shown promise in multiple solid tumor types, their applicability in the setting of advanced OSCC 
remains questionable. Unpredictable side effects, complications, and (especially) high cost limit their US use in low resource 
settings and in low/mid-income countries (LMICs). Survival in patients with advanced OSCC is driven primarily by 
locoregional treatment failure/recurrence (i.e., primary site or cervical nodal basins). Escalation of conventional treatment 
regimens, such as surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy is not feasible due to dose-limiting toxicities. As a result 
of these converging factors, there is a need for novel treatments that can augment existing modalities, while improving 
locoregional control without toxicities. To address this need, Privo has developed the PRV211 intraoperative product
(PRV211), a nano-engineered hydrogel that, immediately after tumor resection or debulking, can be applied directly onto 
the tumor bed. PRV211, retains high concentration of immuno/chemotherapy nanoparticles, locally in tumor bed and 
regional lymph nodes to treat the locoregional disease and reduce tumor recurrence."

In 2022, an estimated 11 million American family caregivers provided 18 billion hours of unpaid care for
individuals living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). These caregivers experience
twice the emotional, physical, and financial problems and increased risk of depression and anxiety compared to
non-AD/ADRD caregivers. As the number of people living with dementia is expected to double to 13.8 million by
2060, the strain on AD/ADRD family caregivers will be further intensified, especially for minoritized caregivers
who are affected disproportionately and face cultural barriers in accessing support. Mindfulness-based
interventions have been shown to improve depression, anxiety, and stress for AD/ADRD family caregivers.
However, caregiver access, engagement, and adherence are challenging due to barriers such as time, cost
($50-400/session), lack of privacy in group sessions, and cultural stigma. Existing caregiver health and
mindfulness apps have low adoption and poor usability, with passive video and audio recordings that are not
interactive or personalized to each caregiver’s life and cultural context. There is a significant unmet need for
easily accessible, personalized, and culturally responsive delivery of mindfulness interventions to support the
needs of diverse AD/ADRD family caregivers. To address this urgent unmet need, we are developing Oasis: a
personalized and culturally responsive mindfulness virtual coaching platform to reduce stress, depression, and
anxiety for AD/ADRD caregivers. Unique from existing apps with pre-recorded content, Oasis leverages
advances in artificial intelligence to adapt its mindfulness delivery to each caregiver’s real-time responses,
caregiving and cultural context, and preferences. In each on-demand, 1:1 session, an avatar, tailored to the
caregiver’s preferences (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, accent/voice), is used to guide and support the caregiver
through personalized mindfulness coaching. To increase engagement and adherence, Oasis’ NLP system
personalizes the avatar’s dialogue based on key aspects of their caregiving experience and culture (e.g.,
challenging AD/ADRD behaviors, favorite foods for mindful eating activity, cultural values such as filial piety
or familism). In Phase 1, our 12-month goals are to develop a prototype of Oasis and test its initial
usability/feasibility for racially and ethnically diverse AD/ADRD family caregivers. By improving usability and
personalizing intervention delivery to each caregiver’s life and cultural context, Oasis directly addresses
barriers impeding mindfulness and health support for AD/ADRD caregivers to increase health equity by offering
a personalized, culturally relevant, and accessible support system to this underserved population."
10920772,"Project Summary
The prevention of burn infections by multi-species multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria is a
daunting challenge to clinicians. Antimicrobial treatment (e.g., minocycline or silver sulfadiazine
cream) and either a negative pressure device or gauze with an absorbent layer have been the
mainstays. However, evidence that these treatments prevent MDR infections is not conclusive,
and bacteria can develop resistance to these treatments. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy
(aPDT) shows promise, but low selectivity in delivery of the photosensitizer (PS) to the wound
and the development of bacterial resistance to the PS are problematic. Thus, the field urgently
needs further advances in prevention of MDR infections in wounds.
We propose an innovative bandage that will prevent MDR infections in burn wounds. We have
developed a superhydrophobic-aPDT (SH-aPDT) dressing that delivers airborne singlet oxygen
which safely addresses these challenges. The device uses an advanced, micro-textured
superhydrophobic coating which minimizes direct contact between the dressing and the wound
and yet can deliver the airborne singlet oxygen in a highly controllable fashion. The gaseous
singlet oxygen kills both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without introducing the PS,
or any other drug, into the wound. Separating the PS from the wound prevents bacterial species
from developing resistance to this treatment. We know from our work with a periodontal rat model,
that SH-aPDT kills harmful bacteria and promotes healing without harming mammalian cells. The
dressing is porous and flexible, allowing wound fluids to be effectively managed, while easily
conforming to the wound surface. A flexible red LED light source can be integrated into the
bandage to permit complete patient mobility suitable for extended hospital stays, or field use by
combat personnel.
The development of a SH-aPDT dressing for the delivery of airborne singlet oxygen would be a
major breakthrough for the prevention of burn infections. The objective of this proposal is to
optimize the dressing design and validate bandage efficacy using an ex vivo porcine skin burn
model as well as a murine Balb/c burn in vivo model."
10921282,"The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop a rapid point-of-care (POC) test, based on
Inter-alpha inhibitor Proteins (IAIP) levels in blood, that assesses the risk of neonatal sepsis (NS) and/or
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants. NS and NEC are associated with high mortality, serious morbidity,
and adverse neuro-developmental outcomes. The currently available biomarkers are not sensitive and specific
enough for early detection of NS and NEC to reliably guide clinical decisions for continuation of antibiotic
treatment in infants whose conventional test results are uninformative. IAIP are found in human plasma at high
concentrations and are rapidly depleted during acute severe infection/systemic inflammation. In the recently
completed SBIR Phase II study, we successfully developed a prototype for a rapid test (RT) that accurately
measures the IAIP level in blood within 15 minutes, with comparable results to a 6-hour laboratory ELISA.
Using the newly developed RT, we confirmed that IAIP level is a sensitive and specific predictive marker for
NS and NEC using blood samples collected from enrolled infants in two quaternary care NICUs. The AUC of
the ROC analysis comparing infants with positive and negative blood cultures was 0.991 and the sensitivity of
96.3% and specificity of 94.6% (p< 0.001). A similar high predictive value of IAIP was observed in infants with
NEC. Overall, the IAIP test has remarkably high positive and negative predictive values in detecting NS (93%
and 98%, respectively) or when NS and NEC are combined (94% and 95%). In this continuation Phase II-B
project, we will further validate the role and utility of this sensitive host-response biomarker in antibiotic
stewardship and compare head-to-head its performance against Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-Reactive Protein
(CRP). We hypothesize that IAIP levels will be significantly reduced in infants with culture proven NS and/or
NEC (Bell’s Stage >2) and IAIP is more sensitive than PCT and CRP in detecting NS and NEC in suspected
infants that are not confirmed by blood culture or radiographs. The IAIP level will remain normal or not be
significantly altered during non-infectious/non-systemic disturbances that generally do not warrant antibiotic
treatment. The IAIP-RT would be useful in reducing exposure to unnecessary long-term, broad-spectrum
antibiotics to these infants. The specific aims are: 1) Process validation and scale-up manufacturing to produce
clinical-grade IAIP-RT batches for implementation of regulatory strategy; 2) Confirm and validate the ROC
characteristics and cut-off value of the IAIP-RT in larger clinical samples of NS and NEC; 3a) Perform a
comparison study of IAIP test head-to-head with PCT and CRP during clinical evaluation of NS and NEC; 3b)
Assess the potential for antibiotic discontinuation in infants with negative blood culture, negative NEC
symptoms AND normal IAIP level and 4) Compare the Natural History of longitudinally collected IAIP levels
with clinical course and outcome. These studies are designed to obtain a robust and fully developed POC
device to measure IAIP levels in infants that is ready for future clinical studies required for FDA approval."

 Genomic biomarkers enable precision medicine by matching patients to their optimal treatments.
Mutational biomarkers are used as standard practice for oncology patients to assign them to treatment.
However, mutations don’t have the predictive power for several therapies, including immunotherapy, which
results in complete and durable responses for a subset of cancer patients. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has
been shown to improve accuracy over mutations in preclinical studies, including being able to predict response
to immunotherapy, and even mutational status. The global RNAseq market is currently estimated at 9 billion
dollars and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10% from 2023 to 2030. The number of RNAseq
biomarker trials has already doubled in 2020-2023 compared to 2010-2020, based on data in clinicaltrials.gov.
RNAseq biomarkers currently face three major challenges: (1) bioinformatics analysis to translate signatures,
cutoffs, etc. for application in the clinic, (2) regulatory issues with reproducibility and clinical validation, and (3)
lack of software platforms to provide clinical trial support for biomarkers. There is currently no commercial
software to support patient selection based on their RNAseq profiles at baseline, to the best of our
knowledge.
 We have developed a prototype software suite, BIOCLIN, for an ongoing multi-site phase II
RNAseq biomarker trial in kidney cancer (NCT05361720). It includes analysis of RNAseq data for each
patient on the fly, run machine learning models and display gene signature scores per patient in an easy to
use, intuitive user interface. Our goal is to develop our prototype into a commercial product with
additional functionality that can be used to rapidly deploy platforms to support biomarker-based trials.
 In this Phase I proposal, we will (1) conduct extensive user research to understand the needs of
investigators for running RNAseq based biomarker trials and develop a roadmap for our BIOCLIN app (2)
develop methods to translate preclinical signatures for clinical use and implement a variety of machine learning
modules to be used for biomarker development, and (3) develop a robust cloud-based backend infrastructure
to enable rapid deployment of custom biomarker platforms at a price point to make such trials economically
feasible for investigators.
 In Phase II we plan to implement methods to tackle regulatory challenges, a robust data security
framework, an improved user interface and a cloud agnostic backend. Our proposal, if successful in obtaining
funding, will address the gap in precision medicine by enabling investigators to test RNAseq biomarkers in
clinical trials, which will undoubtedly have an impact on patients."
10920629,"Abstract
CytoAgents is developing CTO1681 for the prevention and treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a very
promising treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies. However,
CAR T-cell therapy can also result in a high incidence of severe and potentially life-threatening immune-mediated
toxicity, including CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). CRS is a systemic
inflammatory response that has been reported as one of the most frequent and dangerous adverse events
following CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. CRS is thought to be mediated by an initial release of
proinflammatory cytokines, which activate bystander immune cells and endothelial cells, which in turn activate
more immune cells, culminating in a cytokine storm. Because CytoAgents’ novel approach is focused on
reducing the transcription of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, its compound is expected to mitigate,
and in some cases even prevent, CRS. CTO1681 is an orally available, stable compound identical to beraprost
sodium-314d (BPS-314d), the stereoisomer of the racemate beraprost sodium (BPS) that accounts for nearly all
of BPS’s pharmacological activity. Because BPS can modulate the release of cytokines from human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, CytoAgents has investigated the use of BPS and its active isomer CTO1681 as a
treatment for moderate virus-induced CRS, specifically influenza and COVID-19. All of the results to date indicate
that CTO1681 has strong potential to reduce the CRS response, leading to better patient outcomes regardless
of CRS etiology. Overall, BPS, BPS-314d, and CTO1681 formulations have been found to be well tolerated and
to not completely suppress cytokine levels in healthy volunteers with normal serum levels. CytoAgents is
currently expanding clinical investigation of CTO1681 to the treatment of CAR T-cell therapy-induced CRS.
CytoAgents’ Phase 1b trial of CTO1681, a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating safety and pharmacokinetic
(PK) MAD study in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving CD19-directed CAR T-cell
therapy, is scheduled to begin in the coming months. This Direct to Phase II project will support expansion to a
Phase 2a cohort once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined. The company will
undertake three specific aims: 1) determining preliminary efficacy of CTO1681 in preventing or reducing CRS
or ICANS vs. historical or placebo treatment, 2) determining the expanded safety profile of CTO1681 in
patients with DLCBL receiving CAR T-cell therapy, and 3) investigating the potential impact of CTO1681 on
antitumor activity of CAR T-cell therapy compared to historical data and placebo. This project will help support
clinical assessment of CTO1681 in CAR T-cell therapy recipients, advancing a novel treatment with the
potential to reduce hospitalization, intensity of supportive care, and mortality and to improve patients’ quality
of life. Moreover, this therapeutic may allow more patients with R/R hematologic malignancies to have
access to potentially life-saving CAR T-cell treatment."

Transposable elements are a major source of human genetic variation and also contribute to human diseases by causing somatic mutations. The activity of transposition in human cancers is well established. Both expression of the RNA binding protein ORF1p encoded by the L1 element and insertions of L1 and other transposons are commonplace in cancer cells and cancer genomes. However, whether and how retrotransposition contributes to cancer genome evolution and promotes tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, we hypothesize that retrotransposition may promote cancer evolution by causing long-range genomic rearrangements in addition to insertions. This hypothesis is formulated based on both genomic observations in primary cancer genomes and molecular and genomic data from our in vitro experiments. To test this hypothesis, we will combine experimental approaches in in vitro models (Aim 1) with computational analyses (Aim 2) of retrotransposition and retrotransposition-associated rearrangements in primary cancers and precancer cells (Aim 2). Specifically, we propose that non-canonical resolution of LINE-1 insertions can cause DNA breaks and long-range DNA rearrangements, and a subset of these rearrangements further destabilizes genomes by generating acentric or dicentric chromosomes that undergo waves of rearrangements. To test this, we first assess DNA damage and its dependence on the endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activities of L1 ORF2p (Aim 1a). We then determine both immediate and downstream genomic consequences of ORF2p-induced DNA damage using state-of-the-art Look-Seq approaches that combine cell biology and whole-genome sequencing (Aim 1b and 1c). Complementing these in vitro analyses of retrotransposition, we propose to analyze bulk cancer genomes (Aim 2b) and single pre-cancer cell genomes (Aim 2c) to definitively assess the prevalence of insertions and long-range rearrangements that bear the hallmarks of retrotransposition. We focus on esophageal cancers with an extremely high prevalence of retrotransposition (in >90% of cancers) and the precancer condition known as Barrett's Esophagus (BE), where LINE-1 retrotransposition has also been observed previously. The proposed work includes development of new bioinformatic packages for joint rearrangement and transposition detection in shotgun cancer sequencing data that will benefit researchers studying genetic variation, genome instability, and somatic genome evolution (Aim 2a). Together, the proposed studies will thoroughly characterize the relationships between LINE-1 retrotransposition and genome instability writ large and the roles of retrotransposition in cancer evolution. This knowledge may lead to new avenues of cancer prevention and therapeutics."

Primary tumors as well as cancer cell lines have been shown to exhibit extensive genetic and transcriptional
heterogeneity, with multiple subclones co-existing in the same cancer population.1 Even after decades of in-vitro
growth, established cell cultures continue to evolve.2 The heterogeneity of cancer cell lines over space and time
crystallizes into three unmet needs: i) cell culture protocols that offer a high temporal resolution on in-vitro growth
dynamics; ii) close monitoring of the temporal separation between genotypic and phenotypic measurements and
iii) reconciling the cost-prohibitive nature of repeated high-throughput multi-omic measurements with ceaseless
changes in subclonal composition. To fill these needs, we propose to engineer how in-vitro and in-silica experiments
interact into a software solution called CLONEID. An SOL database in the backend, a Java core and an
R user interface will come together to form two modules: One will record the pedigree of lineages grown in a
lab and use computer vision to monitor phenotypic changes, such as variable growth rates. The second module
will link subclonal multi-omics profiles from different high throughput assays to each other and to the phenotypes
from the first module. In aim 1 we will develop the first module and use it to demonstrate feasibility of monitoring
phenotypic transitions of cell lines with CLONE ID at high temporal resolution, without any specialized equipment.
Aim 2 will use this data in conjunction with existing single cell sequencing of the same cell lines to develop and
test the second module and use it to identify subclone-specific biomarkers of growth. Together these aims will
pave the way to more complex mathematical models of carcinogenesis, that do not have to rely on the simplifying
assumption that individual driver mutations have equal fitness effects and that individual subclones have a fixed
growth rate. In the future, the framework developed here will serve as foundation to deploy computer vision for
early detection of morphological changes, including adaptation from in-vivo to in-vitro growth and mycoplasma
contamination."
10915659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Following stroke, numerous impairments develop that affect walking ability. We lack a clear understanding of
what characterizes these impairments and their relation to impaired walking ability. For example, we applied
exoskeletal knee flexion to assist those with reduced knee flexion post-stroke. The assistance improved knee
flexion but surprisingly worsened compensatory motions such as hip abduction. Preliminary analysis indicated
that the assistance elicited hyperexcitable quadriceps reflex activity. Additionally, the quadriceps response was
abnormally coordinated with hip abductor muscles only in post-stroke individuals. These results question
traditional beliefs regarding which motions are compensatory and which are due to neural impairment. Thus,
the critical gap to restoring functional gait post-stroke is characterizing the interconnection between
biomechanical issues and neural impairments. Our novel approach is to combine state-of-the-art methods in
biomechanics and neurophysiology to develop cause-and-effect models of the interconnection between gait
kinematics, hyperexcitable reflex activity and abnormal coordination. The clinical significance is the
groundwork for targeted interventions such as reflex modulation and neurally intelligent exoskeletons that
interact with the impaired spinal circuitry. It will be shown in our preliminary work that we have years of
experience characterizing post-stroke gait impairments using reflex stimulation, robotics and computational
methods that uniquely qualify our group for this project.
 The objective of this proposal is to establish the biomechanical and neurophysiological mechanisms
underlying pathological gait post-stroke. In Aim 1, we determine whether hip abduction is a compensation for
reduced knee flexion by comparing people with stroke to induced similar walking patterns in healthy
individuals. Muscle activation patterns and intralimb coordination will provide evidence towards fundamental
differences in neural control after stroke. In Aim 2, we use reflex neurophysiological methods to probe post-
stroke individuals’ reflex coordination patterns. We expect to find that hyperactive quadriceps reflexes are
associated with impaired knee flexion. We additionally expect to show the interrelation between reflex activity
in the quadriceps and the abductors as predicted by our models representing abnormal coordination. In Aim 3,
we use reflex conditioning protocols during gait based on sophisticated paired peripheral nerve stimulation
techniques. These methods will provide evidence of the spinal mechanisms at the root of abnormal reflex
behavior that likely underlie impaired gait post-stroke. Together this comprehensive testing procedure
incorporates biomechanics and neurophysiology to reveal new knowledge of post-stroke gait impairment.
These results will have broad impact on our understanding of neuromuscular impairments and enable the
development of targeted therapies for treatment."
10915666,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
While several therapies have been approved for melanoma, there are limited treatment options for NRAS mutant (NRASmut) tumors, which account for ~30% of all melanomas. NRASmut tumors are extremely aggressive and are associated with poor patient survival. These types of tumors are highly resistant to available targeted therapies and are poorly responsive to immunotherapies. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to identify novel targets and effective therapies to help this large population of melanoma patients who do not respond to currently available treatments. Our goal is to identify critical vulnerabilities that can be targeted to offset drug resistance in NRAS mutant melanoma. 
Oncogenic NRAS activates both the MAPK and PI3K pathways. However, inhibiting either pathway alone is barely effective in patients and co-targeting both pathways leads to unacceptable toxicities in patients. We previously reported that BRAF-mutant melanomas resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (MAPKi-R) have sustained activation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase. We have now discovered that MAPKi-R NRASmut melanomas rely on the S6K2 isoform for survival. Selective S6K2 blockade, in the context of active S6K1, perturbs redox and lipid metabolism, triggering lethal lipid peroxidation in NRASmut melanoma cells that are resistant to MAPK inhibition. Based on our preliminary findings, we postulate that S6K2 controls metabolic and redox homeostasis, and melanoma cell survival, thereby constituting a novel and promising therapeutic target. As S6K is a node of convergence of the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways, we further posit that selectively blocking S6K2 can overcome resistance to MAPKi mediated by broad molecular mechanisms that rely on these pathways. In this project we will define the mechanism whereby S6K2-dependent lipid and redox homeostasis contributes to drug resistance and promotes survival of MAPKi-R melanoma. Furthermore, we will exploit the dependency of melanoma on S6K2 to offset MAPKi resistance. Our proposed strategy, which is significantly different from MAPK/PI3K inhibition, will enable functional precision by targeting a convergent subnetwork representing a vulnerability selectively in tumor cells. We anticipate that our studies will provide a mechanistic framework to inform the design of therapeutic strategies targeting S6K2 directly, or alternatively, S6K2 specific effector pathways and improve the outcomes of NRASmut melanoma patients and possible other types of RAS-mutant tumors."
10915667,"New Generation of General AMBER Force Field for Biomedical Research
Molecular simulation plays an essential role in biochemical and biophysical research. Its major
application is to decipher molecular interactions between small molecule ligands and
biomolecules, especially protein receptors, so that highly potent agonists or antagonists can be
discovered to enhance or eradicate target functions. Despite tremendous efforts spent on
development, it is still very challenging to accurately predict protein-ligand binding. A key
element to a successful prediction is the quality of practical molecular mechanics force field
(MMFF). From the viewpoint of feasibility, the classical additive force field is in a unique position
to offer computational efficiency while maintaining robustness for accurate and automated
parametrization, which cannot be easily afforded by a polarizable force field. The other key factor
to a successful prediction is the ability of the sampling strategy to effectively sample “hidden”
events that are coupled with state transitions. The major goal of this project is to develop and
test the 3rd generation of GAFF (GAFF3) to significantly improve the quality of the general-
purpose AMBER force fields. GAFF3 will be critically evaluated in studying biomolecule-ligand
interactions using a novel GPU-accelerated 𝜆 -dynamics based orthogonal space tempering
(OST) algorithm. The advanced sampling technique will guarantee that our macromolecule-ligand
binding free energy calculations is not complicated by existing sampling issues so that GAFF3
can be objectively evaluated. We will first develop GAFF3 utilizing ABCG2, a new physical charge
model which has demonstrated its superior performance in large scale solvation free energy
calculations; New force field parameterization techniques, such as applying ANI-1x potentials to
fast detect “bad” torsional parameters, will be extensively applied in GAFF3 development. We will
then critically evaluate the GAFF3 performance in studying biomolecule-ligand interactions using
both pathway-based and endpoint free energy methods. The OST sampling method will be
developed and implemented for this evaluation effort. Last, we plan to apply a variety of strategies
to handle “difficult” molecules identified by us or our users. Those strategies will include fine atom
typing and introduction of new functional forms. We believe that those efforts will allow GAFF3 to
approach the performance limit an additive model could have. We will also expand the chemical
space of GAFF3 to cover those elements not covered by the current GAFF, but frequently
occurring in drugs and PDB ligands. Therefore, the successful pursuit of these research aims will
facilitate us to surmount the challenges in accurately modeling protein-ligand and nucleic acid-
ligand binding."

 The Golgi complex plays a prominent role in secretory and endocytic trafficking in eukaryotic cells
and is key to the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids) that are essential for
life. Golgi resident proteins, such as glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotide transporters, are precisely
distributed across the Golgi stacks by recycling mechanisms that counteract the flow of ongoing vesicular
transport. Dysfunction in these mechanisms, or their hijacking by viruses and toxins, is known to have
serious consequences for human health, leading to congenital disorders of glycosylation, cancers, and
immune dysfunction.
 Membrane proteins residing in various Golgi compartments are well annotated; however, the mecha-
nistic basis of how most Golgi proteins are selected for recycling, or how these processes are regulated
are poorly understood. My lab is interested in uncovering these fundamental mechanisms governing
Golgi homeostasis using a multifaceted approach combining genetics, flow-cytometry, imaging, in vitro
reconstitution, and proteomics. In preliminary results, we have identified novel transmembrane compo-
nents orchestrating recycling of specific subsets of Golgi enzymes. Our findings have opened doors for
interrogating new players and dissecting the mechanisms critical to maintain Golgi identity and function.
Over the next five years, our goals are to (1) identify novel recycling receptors required at different Golgi
compartments and establish a systematic map of the intra-Golgi recycling network, (2) determine how
the transmembrane receptors engage with their cargos, and (3) define the novel functions of a disease-
associated membrane transporter in solute transport and protein recycling in the Golgi. The combined
results of our experiments will elucidate how multiple recycling pathways sustain normal Golgi function,
and how this homeostasis is disrupted in human disease."

The emerging interdisciplinary research field of Regenerative Rehabilitation is based on recent evidence that
post-operative rehabilitation is as important as surgical technique to achieve optimal functional restoration
following orthopedic injuries. Despite this recognition, current rehabilitation protocols remain primarily based on
qualitative prior experience or preferences and lack patient-specific, real-time quantitative feedback. The overall
goal of this project is to develop a sensing system that can monitor the local mechanical environment at
orthopedic repair sites, specifically rotator cuff surgeries, thus providing quantitative feedback for surgeons and
physical therapists (PTs) to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost by optimizing rehabilitation time and
reducing rates of failure and revision surgeries. The sensor would have other applications in large tendon
reconstruction and rehabilitation such as Achilles tendon repair as well. The sensing system is based on battery-
free sensors embedded in suture anchors used for rotator cuff repairs. The suture anchor is wirelessly monitored
with a wearable device, allowing real-time, continuous biofeedback for surgeons and PTs to make informed
decisions and accurately apply evidence-based care. To our knowledge, there is no comparable technology that
can perform similar tasks efficiently, and successful implementation of our system could lead to significant cost
savings in the orthopedic industry. In Phase I, we have developed functional prototypes of the sensor and
performed experiments confirming the technical feasibility. We have also set up a funding strategy and network
of collaborators for studying the effectiveness and commercialization of this technology. The goal of this Phase
II project is to continue the development of the sensor system to meet the safety and marketing requirements of
the technology as a medical device while demonstrating its clinical practicality."
10919150,"Summary
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased 600-700% in North America since the
1980s. EAC only has 18-22% of an overall 5-year survival rate because most patients are discovered at an
advanced stage. The single major risk factor for the development of EAC is Barrett’s esophagus (BE) where
intestinal-like glandular epithelium replaces the normal squamous mucosa of the esophagus. BE affects
approximately 2-5.4%of the adult population in the United States, with 0.12% to 1.6% of BE patients progressing
to EAC annually. Most BE patients will not progress to EAC, but they will experience anxiety and fear about their
uncertain future. It is urgent to find biomarkers to identify BE patients at high-risk progressing to EAC. DNA
hypermethylation at specific genes is the best indicator and occurs early in tumorigenesis and typically increases
with tumor progression. Recently, the role of epigenetic change in the pathogenesis of BE and EAC were
extensively studied. Multiple methylation markers have been suggested to discriminate between high -risk and
low risk BE. However, the sensitivity is relatively low for clinically predicting the patients at high-risk of
progressing to EAC. Regardless of these methylation studies, the clinically useful methylation biomarkers for
predicting BE patients to progress to EAC are still missing. Pre-Cancer Diagnosis is working to address this
critical unmet need by developing a sensitive diagnostic test that will use a target DNA hypermethylation panel
to identify those BE patients with the high-risk progressing to EAC. Recently, we found that several genes with
DNA hypermethylation could identify high-risk BE patients that are progressing to EAC, which demonstrated an
extremely high sensitivity (≈100%), and specificity (≈100%). With the DNA methylation test, we could triage the
BE patients into high-risk and low-risk groups: the high-risk patients will receive early treatment including
mucosal resection or radiofrequency ablation; the low-risk patients will have a longer follow-up interval, which
will decrease the cost. The objective of this study is to validate our preliminary data and further develop a new
methylation diagnostic kit to predict high-risk BE progression to EAC. In Aim 1, we will validate the
hypermethylation genes and develop a methylation diagnostic kit that differentiate BE patients with and without
a high risk of progressing to EAC by both DNA Methylation Epic array and PCR methylation tests. In Aim 2. We
will use whole genome sequence to validate the methylation genes that can predict high -risk BE patients
progressing to EAC and then we will develop a Target Methylation panel (a diagnostic kit) for the clinical trial.
This test will identify high-risk BE patients before progressing to EAC, which is crucial for reducing the incidence
of EAC and improving patient outcomes."

Single-cell transcriptomics is a central component of the PRECISION Human Pain Network because these
powerful new tools provide unprecedented opportunities for understanding the cell types, molecules, and cell-
cell interactions that contribute to chronic pain. The Multi-omics Core will be led by Dr. Renthal and centralizes
the single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic, and next-generation sequencing efforts with an experienced team in
both the development, optimization, and analysis of single-cell and next-generation sequencing efforts. The
centralization of these cutting-edge technologies will ensure that the established protocols can be applied
systematically to all samples from the Center. Specifically, the Core will provide single-cell and single-nucleus
multi-omic services to characterize pain-related tissues in both Projects 1 and 2. They will then provide both
Projects rapid next-generation sequencing services with 1-3 day turnaround times at cost. Finally, the Core will
remain at the cutting-edge of the rapidly evolving field of single-cell genomics and continue to bring innovations
that improve quality and reduce costs back to the Center. The Core will also coordinate with similar Cores across
the U19 PRECISION Human Pain Network to reconcile protocols and best practices."
10928103,"Spatially resolved, single-cell transcriptomic techniques are an exciting and emerging toolbox for the creation of
molecularly defined, cellularly resolved, and, often, functionally annotated tissue atlases. While offering the
potential for transformative new insights into a wide range of tissues and questions – in particular, those
associated with human pain – these techniques have yet to be widely adopted due to the technical challenges
associated with implementing such methods, the lack of a broad expertise in optimal experimental design, and
the requirement, in some cases, for bespoke, home-built instrumentation.
 Here we propose to overcome these challenges by constructing a spatial core that will initially focus on the
spatially resolved transcriptomics approach MERFISH (multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ
hybridization). MERFISH is a massively multiplexed form of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization
that can image and identify hundreds to thousands (and more) different RNAs, and leads this field with its unique
combination of sub-cellular resolution, near 100%-detection efficiency, low false-positive rate, low cost, and ultra-
high throughput. MERFISH provides spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiles in millions of cells across
tens of cm2 of tissues, revealing new insights from this unprecedented molecular and spatial resolution.
 This spatial core will be housed within the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Moffitt, a co-inventor of MERFISH. Only
a few labs in the world are currently equipped to perform MERFISH, of which the Moffitt lab is one; the Moffitt
lab has extensive experience with MERFISH in central-nervous-system tissues; and the Moffitt lab is continuing
to advance the capabilities of this technology. For these reasons, our spatial core, whose staff will be embedded
in the Moffitt lab, should be well positioned to leverage this novel technology, to integrate new innovations in this
space, and to deploy, as needed, emerging new spatial techniques with increased performance.
The spatial core will provide a start-to-finish service that coordinates all aspects of the design, execution,
quality control, and interpretation of spatial measurements, which we will supplement as needed with an array-
based, capture method (Visium). Key services will involve consultation on the design of targeted gene panels;
the design and production of probe libraries; the optimization of tissue preparation, slicing, and clearing
methods; rapid RNA integrity measurements to aid in preparation and sample prioritization; MERFISH
measurement on state-of-the-art, home-built equipment; multi-tier data analysis, including identification of RNA
and cell boundaries; and, finally, the calculation and interpretation of quality control and quality assurance
metrics embedded within each MERFISH measurement. Critically, not only will this core provide fundamental
new insights into human pain-associated neurological processes in health and disease, it will also aid in the
dissemination of spatial transcriptomics to other pain-associated centers and the broader scientific community,
magnifying the broad scientific impact of our efforts here."

Project Summary/Abstract
Lung injury following exposure to mustard vesicants is responsible for most morbidity and mortality of these
high priority chemical threat agents. As there are currently no approved therapeutics to treat mustard
poisoning, it is essential to identify mechanistic targets for drug development. Our focus is on inflammatory
macrophages and mediators they release which we have demonstrated contribute to both acute lung injury
and chronic disease induced by sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustard. One macrophage derived
proinflammatory mediator that we discovered is key in mustard lung toxicity is tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNFα). Based on our findings, Janssen Pharmaceuticals is now working to move SimponiR, a fully humanized
anti-TNFα antibody, into advanced development for treatment of mustard lung poisoning with funds from
BARDA. In recent studies we discovered that farnesoid-X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor important in bile
acid metabolism with anti-inflammatory activity is also important in mustard lung toxicity. Following nitrogen
mustard exposure, macrophage FXR activity is suppressed. This is associated with increased activity of
proinflammatory macrophages and reduced activity of anti-inflammatory/proresolution macrophages. Studies
during the next grant period are aimed at elucidating mechanisms underlying nitrogen mustard induced
suppression of FXR. In preliminary studies we found that microRNAs that regulate the proinflammatory
transcription factor NFκB in macrophages are dysregulated after nitrogen mustard exposure. As a
consequence, there is protracted activation of NFκB signaling resulting in increased production of TNFα and
cytotoxic reactive nitrogen species. We hypothesize that these mediators suppress FXR and its target, NR4A1,
a central regulator of macrophage reprogramming from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype.
To test this hypothesis, we will (1) Analyze the impact of reduced FXR activity on the development of anti-
inflammatory/proresolution macrophages and lung injury following mustard exposure; and (2) Determine if
protracted activation of NFκB is due to mustard-induced alterations in microRNAs regulating NFκB and key
downstream inflammatory gene products, TNFα and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Results of these studies
will lead to new mechanistic insights into mustard lung poisoning and the development of novel therapeutics for
mitigating toxicity."

10928240,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite extensive efforts to characterize the genomes and proteomes of triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC), no dominantly-acting mutated RTK has emerged as therapeutic target in TNBC. Instead, TNBCs exhibit
broad, rather than selective, hyper-activation of RTK signaling, with several proto-oncogenic RTKs hyper-active
in the same tumor. Recent discoveries have revealed that the coordinate activation of RTKs observed in TNBC
is a result of inactivation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12. In the current proposal, we aim to translate
our new knowledge of how RTKs are aberrantly activated and drive TNBC progression into a new therapeutic
approach for TNBC patients.
 Data from our team and confirmed by others indicates that PTPN12 functions as a tumor suppressor by
restraining the activity of a select set of proto-oncogenic RTKs, including MET and PDGFR?, binding these
receptors and suppressing downstream signaling. PTPN12 is compromised in 45-55% of TNBCs, and we have
shown in in vitro and pre-clinical models of TNBC that inactivation of PTPN12 leads to hyper-activation of MET,
PDGFR?, and a small subset of other RTKs. Importantly, this provokes the therapeutic hypothesis that
PTPN12-deficient TNBCs can be treated by combined targeting of RTKs like MET, PDGFR, and potentially
other RTKs that are locked in the chronically active state. To translate these pre-clinical findings into a new
therapeutic approach, we will evaluate the efficacy of the well-tolerated MET/PDGFR inhibitor sitravatinib as
monotherapy in metastatic TNBC patients, develop rational strategies to combine sitravitinib with standard of
care therapies, and explore new ways to capitalize on the anti-tumoral and pro-immune effects of sitravatinib in
the context of immune checkpoint therapies.
 Herein, our mechanistic, pre-clinical, and clinical studies will evaluate the proof-of-concept for the use of
sitravatinib to treat PTPN12-deficient TNBC and lay the groundwork for the next generation of combination
approaches for TNBC and other RTK-dependent cancers."

HIV prevalence among transgender women (TW) in the United States is high (~14%). The best way to reduce
HIV incidence in this population is to link TW to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce HIV
transmission by up to 86%, with optimal adherence. The FDA approved the first long-acting form of PrEP,
injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA), in late 2021, which has the potential to decrease HIV transmission and
increase PrEP adherence among TW. The addition of CAB-LA to available PrEP options necessitates TW and
PrEP service providers select the best method (oral vs injectable) for each TW. However, TW have unique
concerns about PrEP (e.g., interactions with gender-affirming hormones) and report that patient/provider
discussions on this medication are suboptimal. Thus, to inform this shared decision process, the proposed study
builds on formative work by developing and pilot-testing “WePrEP,” a PrEP-focused bilingual digital shared
decision-making tool (SDMT), tailored to diverse English- and Spanish-speaking TW and PrEP service providers.
WePrEP will support communication between TW and PrEP service providers as they identify the ideal PrEP
product for each TW and discuss associated adherence strategies by cuing conversations on TW's unique PrEP
needs/concerns and presenting pertinent information that is culturally relevant and tailored to this population.
 To develop and test WePrEP, we will partner with the Mile High Behavioral Healthcare Transgender Center
of the Rockies, a Denver-based transgender-serving organization. We will use McNulty et al.'s adapted Shared
Decision-Making Model for TW to guide the iterative participatory design process we will use with a group of
racially/ethnically diverse TW and PrEP service providers, to develop WePrEP; we will begin this process using
prototypes created from preliminary data (Aim 1a). We will then rigorously assess the usability of WePrEP via
simulated patient/provider discussions (Aim 1b). Next, we will pilot test WePrEP in a randomized controlled trial
(RCT; N=69 TW) with 2:1 randomization. In the RCT, PrEP service providers (N=4, of which n=1 is bilingual) will
use WePrEP with intervention TW to select CAB-LA or oral PrEP and discuss adherence. Other providers (N=2,
of which n=1 is bilingual) will give control TW a standard of care explanation of PrEP (CDC recommendations)
to help them make their PrEP choice. TW will be referred to Sheridan Health Services to start PrEP. We will
assess primary (feasibility; acceptability) and secondary (potential mechanisms of action of WePrEP; preliminary
impact) outcome measures using validated scales and rigorous qualitative methods (Aims 2, 3).
 By creating a bilingual digital SDMT to enhance communication between TW and PrEP service providers as
TW choose their ideal PrEP modality, our project is likely to make a widespread and lasting impact on TW's
uptake and adherence to PrEP. Our application responds to NOT-MH-21-105,

There is a critical need for heterosexual men in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to receive HIV care, including
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), following an HIV self-test (HIVST).
Heterosexual men in SSA are routinely shown to be at a high risk for HIV acquisition, but test at lower rates
than women and experience inadequate linkages to HIV care following a self-test, regardless of the test
result. Tanzania’s Sauti Project was launched in 2015 by the Tanzania Ministry of Health (MoH) and included
the piloting of HIVST and community-based PrEP and ART administration for women, female sex workers,
and men who have sex with men. However, heterosexual men were not included in this study, despite their
high risk. Based on feedback from men that peer-based navigation and community-based linkage to care
services are preferrable to facility-based HIV care, the STEP+cbNIMART intervention was developed. There
are three aims to this study. Aim 1.) Tailor the STEP+cbNIMART intervention for heterosexual male self-
testers. In Aim 1, the intervention will be further tailored to men through a “theater test” and feedback from
key stakeholders and topical experts, and later utilized for training Community Based Health Service
Providers (CBHSPs) who will help deliver the intervention. Aim 2.) Test the effectiveness of the
STEP+cbNIMART intervention on ART or PrEP initiation and retention for male self-testers. We will
conduct a cRCT using a hybrid type I implementation-effectiveness study design to assess the effectiveness
of the intervention. The cRCT will include an intervention and control arm, with intervention participants
receiving nurse-led community-based ART and PrEP initiation, and control arm participants receiving the
standard of care. ART and PrEP adherence will be measured through a baseline survey and subsequent
follow-ups of participants in both arms. Aim 3.) Evaluate the facilitators and barriers of implementing the
intervention to refine the intervention for adoption in other settings. We will use a qualitative approach
to explore facilitators and barriers affecting nurses’ and CBHSPs’ abilities to implement the intervention and
men’s abilities to participate in the intervention and refinements that are needed to make the intervention as
successful as possible."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV infection and drug abuse are intertwined
epidemics that limit adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and contribute to the worsening of
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders referred to as ""NeuroHIV."" Despite the ability of cART to significantly
decrease viremia, the brain remains a reservoir of low-level HIV replication with the accumulation and
persistence of cytotoxic viral proteins, including the HIV Transactivator of transcription (Tat). Methamphetamine
is a highly addictive synthetic stimulant commonly abused by HIV-infected people worldwide. It is generally
established that HIV/HIV proteins and methamphetamine activate inflammasomes in central nervous system
cells, particularly microglia. However, there is a knowledge gap in our understanding of how HIV/HIV proteins
and methamphetamine contribute to activating astrocyte-specific inflammasomes – NLRP6, leading to
neuroinflammation, which is the focus of this study. The long-term goal is to identify the molecular mechanism(s)
involved in HIV and methamphetamine-mediated astrocyte activation, which can set the stage for developing
novel therapeutic targets to alleviate neuroinflammation associated with NeuroHIV. This proposal uses in vitro,
ex vivo, and in vivo approaches to identify the molecular mechanism(s) involved in HIV Tat and
methamphetamine-mediated astrocyte-specific NLRP6 inflammasome and its role in PANoptosis-mediated
neuroinflammation. The central hypothesis is that HIV Tat-mediated astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation
in NeuroHIV involve ZBP1/NLRP6-mediated PANoptosis. The hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims,
and the outcome of this study will set the stage for developing novel therapeutics to dampen HIV and drug abuse-
mediated neuroinflammation in NeuroHIV. Overall, this R01 application aims to determine how exposure to HIV
Tat and methamphetamine induces the astrocyte-specific inflammasome, NLRP6, and its role in PANoptosis-
mediated neuroinflammation using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches."
10924714,"Project Summary/Abstract.
A small fraction of individuals infected with HIV-1 generate antibodies that can potently neutralize
diverse circulating strains of HIV-1. Such broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have provided
sterilizing immunity in passive immunization studies in animal models. Therefore, the induction of
such antibodies by vaccination is a global health priority as a means to prevent HIV infection. The
membrane proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is a site of
particular interest. A promising strategy to initiate bnAb induction is germline targeting (GT) in
which immunogens are engineered to specifically activate B cell precursors of bnAbs. Previous
work generated germline-targeting priming MPER epitope scaffolds capable of activating and
expanding 10E8-like precursor B cell receptors (BCRs) in mouse and non-human primate (NHP)
models. This project seeks to develop soluble and membrane-bound boost immunogens that
present the MPER epitope in a more native-like context with the aim of maturing primed BCRs to
acquire bnAb features.
Known bnAbs have high degrees of somatic hypermutation (SHM); therefore, I hypothesize that
vaccine induction of bnAbs will require sequential immunization with multiple immunogens
designed to shepherd affinity maturation of the BCR to acquire neutralization breadth and
potency. I will test this hypothesis through three primary aims to: 1) determine effect of mRNA vs.
protein immunogen delivery on immunogenicity and BCR maturation of 10E8-GT priming
candidates; 2) develop and test epitope-scaffold boost candidates for the ability to engage and
mature B cells activated by GT primes; 3) generate stabilized transmembrane envelope
constructs that preferentially bind MPER targeting antibodies. I expect the results of these aims
will generate candidate immunogens that bind with high affinity to 10E8-like antibodies with
various levels of mutation and maturity in order to shepherd antibodies towards breadth.
During this process, I will receive training in immunology, structural biology, and immunology from
my interdisciplinary mentors. The resources available at Scripps Research and from other
collaborators will ensure I develop the skills needed for my long-term goal of leading a vaccine
development research group."
10925620,"Experiencing an emotionally traumatic event, even without physical injury, results in developing a debilitating
condition, termed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in an estimated 20-30% of people. Women are
affected at twice the rate of men, present with different symptoms and respond differently to the same
therapies that are effective for men. This suggests that PTSD has individual susceptibility and is sexual
dimorphic. Prevalence of PTSD is higher in military personnel leading to rising costs to the Veteran's
Administration and society, in general, due to loss of productivity and quality of life. Since most cases of PTSD
are treatment resistant coupled with a high incidence of people with PTSD who do not seek treatment,
understanding susceptibility is critical to building resilience and helping reduce the incidence of PTSD. We
define susceptibility factors as those that can be identified and manipulated before trauma such that their
manipulation alters the acquisition and/or maintenance of PTSD. With the increase in female soldiers and
Veterans, it is important to investigate if there are sex differences in susceptibility factors to inform if the same
resilience building task will work for both men and women.
We previously developed an animal model for revealing individual susceptibility to a PTSD-like phenotype
before trauma (RISP model). However, we discovered that different parameters are needed to reveal
susceptibility for male and female rats. Exposure to a mild stressor is necessary but not sufficient to reveal
susceptibility in males while in females, the mild stressor is sufficient to reveal susceptibility to developing a
PTSD-like phenotype. Thus, we propose two models: RISP-M for male rats and RISP-F for female rats and
propose to complete the characterization of RISP-F by investigating whether a mild stressor is not only
sufficient but also necessary for revealing susceptibility.
Using RISP-M, we have identified putative susceptibility factors: impaired hippocampal and medial prefrontal
cortex function, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the medial prefrontal cortex. We also have
evidence that pre trauma interventions that engage the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex improved
post trauma outcomes in susceptible male rats. Whether these apply to female rats is currently unknown.
The current proposal builds on our expertise and previous work, supported by the VA. It will test the overarching
hypothesis that susceptibility to a PTSD-like phenotype is sexually dimorphic: it requires different
behavioral determinants, has different susceptibility factors, and can inform sex-dependent resilience-
building interventions with three specific aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a brief exposure to a mild
stressor (cat hair) is necessary and sufficient to reveal susceptibility to a PTSD-like phenotype in female rats;
Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that putative susceptibility factors for a PTSD-like phenotype are sexually dimorphic;
Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that resilience-building interventions are not sexually dimorphic. The findings will
provide the field with a new model for identifying susceptibility to a PTSD-like phenotype in female rats, begin to
address whether male and female rats have similar susceptibility factors and inform the development of
resilience-building interventions that may need to be different in males and females."
10924363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal will study the plant monkeyflower (Mimulus) to address why telomere lengths vary between
individuals, and how that variation affects an organism’s fitness and ultimately its evolution. Telomeres are
DNA-protein complexes found at ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and have the crucial role of protecting
chromosome ends from genomic instability. Changes in the telomere length can have catastrophic
consequences for an organism, for instance in humans aberrant telomere lengths can lead to tumorigenesis
and aging-related diseases. Paradoxically, despite the potential deleterious consequences, telomere lengths
are highly variable within natural organisms indicating a potential functional mechanism maintains variable
telomere lengths within populations. Uncovering the mechanisms of telomere length regulation and
understanding the biological significance of natural telomeric variation is crucial, as it provides the framework
for understanding human telomere variation with potential relevance for understanding human predisposition to
aging and associated diseases. However, the causes and the biological consequences of telomere length
variation are poorly understood, and addressing this gap in knowledge is the long-term goal of my lab. As a
first step to achieve this goal my research has established plants as a novel system to study telomere genetics
and evolution. I discovered plant telomere lengths are associated with variation in reproductive life-history traits
(i.e. time to flowering) and adaptive evolution has shaped the genetic variants controlling the telomere length
variation. Based on these observations I propose a hypothesis that telomere length affects cellular
development by influencing stem cells in growth centers, and this ultimately has consequences for
development of the whole organism. This hypothesis fundamentally explains why telomere length varies within
and between populations. This proposal will empirically test this hypothesis by using Mimulus as a model and
take a mechanistic approach of understanding the function and evolution of telomere length variation and its
causal link with developmental growth. Because the molecular components of the telomere are largely
conserved between animals and plants, this study has the potential to uncover the molecular and evolutionary
rules of telomere function that are shared across eukaryotes. The proposed work will investigate the
mechanistic link between the telomere length and cellular development of pluripotent stem cells that
differentiate into whole plant. Work will also investigate the evolutionary consequences arising from the link
between telomere and developmental growth, examining its role in driving the adaptive evolution of telomere
regulating genes and its role in selecting for the life-history strategy in natural populations. Ultimately, this
research will establish the basic framework for understanding the molecular and evolutionary effects arising
from the telomere, with results that can have broad applicability for other organisms, including humans."
10923555,"Twenty-five percent of the Veterans receiving care from the VA are being treated for diabetes. Consequently,
more than half suffer from diabetic retinopathy, which is an incurable disease that can lead to vision loss. The
current treatments for diabetic retinopathy are futile to approximately 75% of diabetics with varying stages of
this blinding disease. Accordingly, new therapeutics are needed. Our proposed studies ultimately relate to this
clinically relevant need. Recently, we discovered STEAP4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the
Prostate 4) is upregulated in our VA patients that suffer from diabetic retinopathy. This discovery is noteworthy
because STEAP4 is a metabolic enzyme that can mediate inflammation, oxidative stress, and iron
accumulation, which are intrinsic pathologies of the onset of diabetic retinopathy. Although the function of
STEAP4 in the retina is unknown, our preliminary data provides strong evidence that STEAP4 plays a role in
iron uptake and ROS production in the diabetic retina. We will further investigate the mechanistic details of
STEAP4’s impact on these pathologies. Since ROS and iron accumulation are inherent to the development of
diabetic retinopathy, we will also examine the effect STEAP4 has on ferroptosis, neuroretina damage, visual
function, and vascular impairment. These proposed studies will provide a full understanding of the functional
impact STEAP4 has on the onset and progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Subsequently, we
will also examine the intrinsic pathologies of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Cancer studies provide strong
evidence that IL-17A mediates STEAP4 to induce vascularization. We previously determined that IL-17A
induces retinal neovascularization, and postulate that STEAP4 is the mediated effector of this vascular
proliferation in the retina. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we will examine the unprecedented role of
STEAP4 in retinal neovascularization. Our findings could identify a deduced mechanism of vision loss in
proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Overall, we are optimistic that all of our proposed work will improve our
understanding of this retinal microvascular disease, while identifying a new drug target for diabetic retinopathy."
10925261,"ABSTRACT
The adult mammary gland is maintained by unipotent progenitor populations which are derived
from multipotent stem cells exclusive to embryonic development. The emergence of multipotency
caused by oncogenic mutations in adult glands is a common process in malignant breast cancer
transformation that enables cellular plasticity and promotes tumor heterogeneity. Although these
processes pose immense therapeutic challenges for aggressive undifferentiated breast cancers
such as Basal-like Breast Cancer (BLBC), the most common Triple Negative Breast Cancer
(TNBC), the mechanisms underlying cellular plasticity in the adult mammary gland remain poorly
understood. The BLBC founder cell (BFC) is likely of the ER- luminal lineage as suggested by
multiple groups, however concrete evidence to prove this notion is lacking. In this proposal, we
seek to identify and characterize the BFC and to uncover mechanisms responsible for
multipotency reactivation in these cells. We hypothesize that a transformation competent
unipotent luminal progenitor acquires multipotency through a conserved pathway or gives rise to
multipotent progeny that undergo stepwise reprogramming essential for BLBC tumor progression.
To test this hypothesis, I have performed single cell RNA sequencing of hyperplastic mammary
glands in the C3/Tag BLBC mouse tumor model to (1) establish candidate BFC populations by
integrating epithelial clustering data with RNA velocity and pseudotemporal analysis of cell
populations, (2) determine the role of suspected BFC clusters in mammary gland and tumor
development, and finally (3) identify the molecular determinants of dedifferentiation in the BFC.
Findings from the analysis of this data and from follow up lineage tracing experiments will reveal
the BFC in the highest resolution to date as well as pathways involved in its transformation and
subsequent dedifferentiation. A detailed understanding of aberrant dedifferentiation in BLBC may
be useful for improving the state of current and future BLBC treatments and for treatment of other
aggressive cancers that employ cellular plasticity for treatment resistance and evasion. Under the
proven mentorship and expertise of Dr. Wenjun Guo, I will execute the research and training plan
outlined in this proposal. This, combined with the training environment provided by the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine will allow me to contribute to the fields of breast cancer and stem
cell biology and to develop the research and professional skills necessary to become an
independent physician-scientist."

SPORE-sponsored projects. Core B is co-led by Drs. Raja Seethala, Simion Chiosea and Rivka Colen, with
Dr. Colen specifically recruited to bring imaging and radiomics expertise to the HN SPORE. Core B will
continue to work with surgeons and coordinators to facilitate the acquisition and efficient use of head and
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) biospecimens and provide specialized histologic evaluation of these
tissues for the SPORE research projects and developmental programs. As previously, Core B is responsible
for collection, triage, processing and distribution or storage of specimen and tissue histopathology, tissue
microarray generation, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and interpretation. However, Core B’s function has
expanded to facilitating multiple “-omics”-based analysis, including whole exome and transcriptome
sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin
Sequencing, NanoString digital spatial (DSP) profiling, multi-parameter flow cytometry, and multi-spectral
fluorescent imaging. Additionally, as part of Core B’s expanding capabilities, standard of care CT images for
HNSCC patients can now be easily acquired, processed with extraction and analysis of radiomics features in
the service of HN SPORE-sponsored research. Information derived from Core B will freely flow to Core C for
additional analysis, with key variables and information linked to the organ specific database (OSD) in Core A,
a detailed, searchable repository of over 12,000 HNSCC patients. The overarching goal of Core B is to provide

 The Developmental Research Program (DRP) of the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) Head and Neck
(HN) SPORE seeks to fund and facilitate translationally driven, innovative pilot projects in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The overarching goal is to decrease HNSCC morbidity and mortality
through stimulating new research in the areas of prevention and early detection; mechanisms of tumorigenesis
and therapeutic resistance; predictive and prognostic biomarkers; and novel targets and approaches to
therapy. To accomplish this goal, we will build on our successful program that, in this current funding cycle,
supported 15 awards that subsequently contributed to 42 publications, 9 external grants, 3 patents, 6
inventions and 2 clinical trials, with a return on investment of 27.2 (ie. for every dollar invested 27.2 were
returned). Biannually, we will widely solicit proposals from investigators new to HNSCC research as well as
from established HNSCC investigators with highly innovative ideas. Members of the Internal and External
Advisory Boards will be encouraged to identify investigators outside of the HCC HN SPORE who could serve
as potential collaborators. In addition, we have established a partnership with Emory University, Johns Hopkins
University, Howard University and Meharry – the latter two designated Historical Black Universities – in an
effort to expand the diversity of the applicant pool and be responsive to the most recent SPORE PAR-20-305,
with a specific additional DRP award annually for an URM project leader.
 The most meritorious proposals submitted will be selected based on an NIH-style two-tiered review to ensure
rigor and absence of bias and support will come from both SPORE funds and institutional commitment. DRP
awardees new to HNSCC will be assigned an experienced mentor to provide guidance and integration into the

10924038,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain is a ubiquitous problem and growing concern for society, contributing substantially to the ongoing
opioid epidemic. Back pain is the most common chronic pain diagnosis and the most common diagnosis for
which opioids are prescribed. Clinical practice guidelines and opioid-prescribing recommendations make it
clear that nonpharmacologic pain treatments are preferable to opioids for patients with back pain. Despite
unequivocal evidence, over-prescribing of opioids to individuals with back pain persists. Primary care providers
serving rural and low income communities face specific challenges to providing nonpharmacologic pain care
instead of over-reliance on opioids. Providers of nonpharmacologic care are often absent from these
communities and even if present may be inaccessible to patients with limited financial resources. Many rural
and low income communities are served by federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs). FQHCs often serve
communities at the forefront of the opioid crisis but too often lack options to provide accessible
nonpharmacologic alternatives to the patients they serve.
This Project describes a 1-year planning phase followed by a 4-year clinical trial that will compare the
effectiveness of different strategies to provide efficacious nonpharmacologic interventions to patients with back
pain seeking care in FQHCs throughout the state of Utah. The strategies evaluated are designed to overcome the
barriers specific to rural and low income communities served by FQHC clinics through innovative use of
telehealth resources. The randomized clinical trial will evaluate two interventions strategies, one providing both
a brief pain teleconsult with phone-based physical therapy, the other uses an adaptive strategy – providing the
brief pain teleconsult first, followed by phone-based physical therapy among those non-responsive to this
treatment. We will also evaluate outcomes related to the efforts to implement strategies in FQHC clinics in
order to provide valuable information for future efforts to scale effective strategies into other low resource
health care settings. Our clinical trial has 4 Specific Aims: 1) compare the effectiveness of a pain teleconsult
intervention with or without phone-based physical therapy for patients with chronic back pain in FQHCs, 2)
compare the effectiveness of different 2-phase treatment strategies in which phone-based physical therapy is
considered either a first-line or second-line option, 3) examine the results for Aims 1 & 2 in pre-specified sub-
groups of patients based on baseline characteristics, and 4) examine implementation outcomes of the pain
teleconsult including acceptability, adoption, feasibility and fidelity."
10924041,"BEETroot juice to reverse functional impairment in PAD: The BEET PAD Trial
 Our work and that of others demonstrate that people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD)
have greater functional impairment, more rapid functional decline, and faster mobility loss than those without
PAD. In PAD, lower extremity ischemia during walking activity increases gastrocnemius (calf) muscle oxidative
stress, damages myofibers, and induces calf muscle mitochondrial dysfunction. Yet few medical therapies
improve functional impairment or prevent mobility loss in PAD.
 Inorganic nitrate, abundant in beetroot juice, is a major source of nitric oxide (NO). In preclinical studies,
NO increases angiogenesis and perfusion, protects against ischemic injury, enhances mitochondrial activity,
and activates satellite cells, which restore and repair skeletal muscle. In three small pilot clinical trials,
including two by our co-investigator Dr. Jason Allen, oral nitrate or beetroot juice meaningfully improved
walking ability in people with PAD, compared to placebo. We propose a definitive multi-centered double-blind
randomized trial of beetroot juice vs. placebo in 210 people with PAD. We hypothesize that by increasing
lower extremity perfusion, calf muscle mitochondrial activity, and myofiber health and regeneration, beetroot
juice will improve walking performance in PAD. Our primary aim will determine whether, compared to placebo,
beetroot juice significantly improves six-minute walk at 4-month follow-up. In secondary aims, we will
distinguish acute from chronic effects of beetroot juice on six-minute walk and measure the effects of beetroot
juice on calf muscle perfusion, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, physical activity (ActiGraph), the Walking
Impairment Questionnaire, and the short physical performance battery (SPPB).
 Nitrate in beetroot juice is metabolized to nitrite and subsequently to NO, attaining peak nitrite levels 2.5
hours after ingestion. Inter-individual variability exists in the extent of metabolic conversion of nitrate to nitrite.
Therefore, in a secondary aim, among PAD participants randomized to beetroot juice, we will determine
whether those who attain a higher peak or a greater increase in plasma nitrite 2.5 hours after beetroot juice
consumption have greater increases in six-minute walk at 4-month follow-up, compared to those who attain a
lower peak or a smaller increase in plasma nitrite. We will also measure the durability of beetroot juice effects,
by repeating six-minute walk distance 7 and 14 days after the final dose of beetroot juice or placebo. We will
perform calf muscle biopsy at baseline and follow-up to study the effects of beetroot juice on muscle
mitochondrial biogenesis and activity, mitophagy, capillary characteristics, and myofiber health.
 If beetroot juice improves functional performance and prevents functional decline in PAD, this widely
available and well tolerated therapy will have a major impact on preventing mobility loss and improving
quality of life in the large and growing number of people disabled by PAD."
10924042,"Project Summary
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, with a worldwide prevalence of over 65 million. There is general
agreement that epilepsy is caused by hyperexcitable neuronal networks and most therapeutic strategies have
focused on decreasing excitation by targeting neuronal synaptic proteins. Even with the available antiepileptic
drugs, there is still no cure and 30% of patients are resistant to treatment. Historically, epilepsy has been viewed
as driven solely by defects in brain processes; however, this brain-centric perspective neglects the fact that the
function of the nervous system is affected by the metabolic state of the body. Current research recognizes that
microorganisms influence the brain by modifying metabolic factors in the gut, the “gut-brain axis.” Most of the
evidence thus far is correlative showing that changes in the gut microbiota can affect seizure outcomes.
However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding specific mechanisms by which gut microbes contribute to seizure
development that may offer novel approaches to treat epilepsy. Viral infection-induced epilepsy is the most
common cause of epilepsy worldwide and is often difficult to model in rodents due to high mortality rates.
However, the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a low-mortality viral-induced model of temporal
lobe epilepsy. Intracranial TMEV injection leads to hippocampal neuronal dysfunction, widespread cortical
astrogliosis, and seizure-genesis peaking at 6 days post infection in ~50% of adult C57BL/6 mice. While central
nervous system inflammation has been posited as a potential modulator of seizure phenotype development in
TMEV infection, the molecular mechanism is unclear. Data obtained from this model surprisingly indicated that
the majority of taxonomies underrepresented in TMEV-infected mice with seizure phenotypes contained genera
associated with the production of the bacterial metabolite S-equol. These bacteria convert dietary daidzein into
S-equol, which has been shown to activate large conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (BK) channels.
Activation of BK channels play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability and therefore represents a
novel target for the treatment of epilepsy. This proposal will determine if depletion of the microbial-derived
metabolite, S-equol, increase seizure occurrence in TMEV-injected mice. It further tests the hypothesis that S-
equol-producing microbial species confer neuroprotection against seizure susceptibility and neuronal
hyperexcitability following TMEV injection via activation of BK channels. This hypothesis will be tested using a
combination of EEG and electrophysiology recordings, mass spectrometry and 16S RNA sequencing. To
determine whether these findings are broadly applicable to other types of epilepsy we will examine three models
of epilepsy, TMEV, kainic acid and a genetic epilepsy model. This work takes a critical step causally linking
specific microbial shifts to neuronal excitability, seizures and epilepsy and will identify microbial metabolites that
can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."
10924043,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The high-throughput sequencing technology allows us to query both common and rare variants for complex
human diseases. When variants are rare, single variant association analyses suffer from low power. To increase
power, existing whole-exome sequencing studies often aggregate the rare variants (RVs) across an entire gene
to study their collective effect. Presumably, when a gene harbors many pathogenic RVs, the aggregation will
increase the signal-to-noise ratio and thus the power. However, a gene often carries many mutations, while only
a subset will lead to novel or altered activities. These mutations usually do not distribute uniformly across the
entire gene or domain. For genes whose functional mutations are localized or concentrated to the specific
subregions, aggregating all the RVs across the entire gene or domain will dilute the signal, resulting in a loss of
power. Besides, even if the gene- or domain-based analysis can identify the pathogenic genes, they cannot
pinpoint the pathogenic subregions. Pinpointing the pathogenic subregions is preferred because it is usually
more unified in function and will be more informative to the downstream disease mechanism and translational
studies. To address these concerns and needs, we propose a novel statistical and computational method for
rare-variant association analysis with the three main features. First, it automatically searches the GVSs with
different sizes for their disease associations to optimize power. Second, it can pinpoint the disease-associated
GVSs with high resolution to facilitate the downstream disease mechanism studies. Third, it can be easily
customized to fit the special needs, such as preserving data privacy, incorporating functional annotations, and
adjusting for varying ancestry loadings for admixed populations. We will establish a rigorous mathematical and
statistical foundation for the GVS analysis and develop the software to realize its implementation on high-
throughput sequencing studies. We will apply our method to an ongoing whole-exome sequencing study of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to identify ALS-related genomic subregions."
10923195,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Over half of the 6 million persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States also suffer from
chronic pain, which reinforces a negative cycle of negative cycle of poor health outcomes and increased risk of
illicit opioid use. There is a desperate, pressing need for innovative and equitable therapies to relieve suffering
of patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD.
 Mindfulness interventions are thought to affect pain and opioid use through directly increasing dispositional
mindfulness and by indirectly decreasing stress response, improving cognitive processing of pain (e.g., pain
acceptance), increasing positive affect, and by reducing opioid craving. Based on our group’s compelling pilot
data, we will test the hypothesis that an immersive mindfulness VR intervention will improve pain and illicit
opioid use among people with chronic pain and OUD. To do so, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to
test the efficacy of an on-site evidence-based immersive mindfulness VR treatment (RelieVRx) vs non-
immersive VR (sham VR). We will enroll and randomize 185 participants with chronic pain and OUD to either
twice-weekly RelieVRx or twice-weekly Sham VR over 8 weeks at OTPs in the Bronx, NY, the poorest borough
in New York and a consistent epicenter for the opioid epidemic. Our co-primary outcomes are pain intensity
and illicit opioid use at 12 weeks.
 We will test the effectiveness of immersive mindfulness VR on pain and illicit opioid use in patients with
chronic pain and opioid use disorder enrolled at opioid treatment programs (Aim 1). We will examine daily
effects of the intervention on mindfulness, stress, pain, opioid craving, and physiologic stress responses (Aim
2). Lastly, we will explore mechanisms underlying intervention effects (Aim 3).
 This highly innovative project utilizes novel and emerging technology to address critical gaps in care in
vulnerable populations with comorbid chronic pain and OUD. Given our experience and expertise, our multi-
disciplinary team is well positioned to test an immersive mindfulness VR intervention in an opioid treatment
program."

Comprehensive evidence-based, multi-component interventions are needed to address risk reduction and self-
management across the HIV care continuum. Interventions targeting traditional HIV risk behaviors without
addressing contextual issues like access to care, mental health, and stigma are likely to exacerbate inequities
in HIV incidence and perpetuate ongoing health disparities. Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) are well-suited
to address these challenges given the ubiquity of highly personal mobile technology, however, DHI creators
face major barriers when creating, managing, disseminating, and scaling evidence-based tailored
interventions. Recent advances in data science present a salient opportunity to create resources that
accelerate and improve the process of developing DHIs and empower intervention developers to better
address diverse real-world needs and deliver health-promoting activities across at-risk populations. Our team
has been at the forefront of designing stand-alone DHIs that have shown promise for impacting distinct HIV
continuum outcomes. Our DHI platform, HealthMpowerment (HMP), was built upon years of prior human-
centered design and rigorous clinical trials research and has demonstrated significant reductions in HIV
transmission risk behaviors, increased engagement in HIV care and decreases in perceived HIV stigma.
However, to be most impactful, HMP requires optimization and modernization to further improve its reach and
to better meet the needs of the research community and potential end-users. This Phase II project proposes to
build on the prior funded work and develop a unified study management platform to aid researchers to
efficiently develop and deploy behavior change interventions and effectively manage participants throughout
the duration of their trial engagement. We have assembled a team with expertise in digital user experience,
software development, and behavioral science with a strong focus on intervention research related to HIV
prevention. Leveraging this expertise, our proposal aims to refine and evaluate HMP Next Gen, a
comprehensive, evidence-based digital health solution poised to expedite culturally meaningful research to
promote health equity. In Aim 1, using human centered design, and working iteratively with expert
stakeholders, we will streamline and expedite platform deployment by automating the process through the
development of researcher facing tools. This includes transition to a cloud-based server, and development of a
robust content management system and self-service portal for research project deployment. In Aim 2, we will
modernize and expand capabilities of HMP to facilitate study implementation, including participant
management, administration workflow and the ability to capture and respond to real-time analytics. In Aim 3,
we will evaluate the impact of newly created tools on study deployment and implementation. If successful,
HMP Next Gen will reduce research costs and management burden, by expediting study start-up and
implementation with a goal of improving health outcomes and reducing inequities."
10918706,"Infants and children living with HIV-1 develop HIV-1 envelope (Env)-reactive broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs) with a higher frequency and faster kinetics than adults, but the mechanisms of pediatric bnAb
induction are not fully defined. Importantly, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bnAb
induction in pediatric subjects will improve our understanding of pediatric HIV-1 immunity, and inform pediatric
HIV-1 vaccine design to elicit bnAbs. We recently used a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus
(SHIV) to infect neonate RMs that generated heterologous HIV-1 nAbs over time as young RMs. Following
neonatal SHIV infection in rhesus macaques (RMs), 8/13 (62%) animals generated plasma nAbs against
heterologous HIV-1, with increased titers over time (6-24 months) in association with enhanced germinal
center (GC) activity, including antigen (Ag)-specific GC B cells—a known mechanism for bnAb induction in
humans. After neonatal rearing, the available dams were infected with the same SHIV and 3/11 (27%) dams
generated heterologous HIV-1 nAbs with increased titers over time. Compared to neonate RMs, dams also had
lower mean plasma viral load over time, and higher levels of CD4 T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr)—both of
these mechanistic differences are known to impact bnAb development. Thus, we now have an appropriate
model to define pediatric HIV-1 immunity associated with Env-reactive bnAb induction. In this proposal, we will
define the unique specificities of pediatric immunity associated with HIV-1 bnAb induction using immune cell
transcriptomics (Aim 1) combined with viral env evolution analyses (Aim 2) in young SHIV-infected RMs. In
Aim 3, we will isolate and characterize blood and GC B cell-derived HIV-1 nAbs in young RMs following
neonatal SHIV infection, with a focus on defining the maturation of pediatric nAbs that can develop into bnAb
status. Finally, we will use env-nAb coevolutionary analyses to identify candidate Env immunogens to elicit
HIV-1 bnAbs as previously described. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows:
Aim 1. To define the permissive immunologic milieu for heterologous HIV-1 nAb induction in pediatric
subjects.
Aim 2. To identify env mutation patterns associated with neutralization breadth development following
 SHIV-infection in young and adult RMs.
Aim 3. To define the characteristics and maturation pathways of heterologous HIV-1 nAbs elicited
 following neonatal SHIV infection."
10920282,"Abstract (Project Summary)
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the major neurodegenerative disorders and leading cause of dementia, mostly
prevalent in the aging population. Aging-associated impairments and cognitive decline due to AD and other
neurodegenerative disorders severely affect the quality-of-life for elders and add significantly to related
socioeconomic costs, which in the U.S. was estimated to total over $655 billion in 2020. Chronic systemic
inflammation is an underlying driver for several disease states including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and
cardiovascular disease. Neuroinflammation, defined as an inflammatory response in the brain, spinal cord, glia, or
other neuronal tissue, contributes significantly to neurodegenerative signaling cascades which underlie AD and
other diseases such as FTLD, PD, HD, MS, ALS, and TBI. Particularly in AD, initial neuroinflammatory response
(M2 phenotype) develops as a defense mechanism within the CNS to rid itself of diverse noxious agents, cellular
debris, and misfolded proteins such as Tau and Aβ. Despite their intended roles to attenuate tissue injury, cellular
inflammatory processes in the CNS that become chronic and uncontrolled (M1 phenotype) inhibit regeneration and
promote neurodegeneration. Overactivation of Kv1.3, a member of the super family of voltage-gated potassium
channels, is heavily implicated in tipping the M1 (classical activation) / M2 (alternative activation) phenotype
expression in microglia from a balanced steady-state (good neuronal health) to predominately the M1 phenotype
mode of microglial activation associated with AD. Both peptidic and small molecule inhibitors of Kv1.3 have shown
efficacy in numerous animal models of AD, but their further development has been hampered by poor drug-like
properties. As such, using a fragment based pharmacophore analysis and design, Hager Biosciences has
discovered differentiated scaffold classes small molecule Kv1.3 channel blockers which showed potent inhibitions
in CHO cells stably expressing h Kv1.3 using electrophysiological whole-cell voltage-clamp format. Therefore, the
goal of this project is to further develop these compounds as innovative potential treatments for AD. Thus, the 1st
Specific Aim is to (a) complete the in vitro characterization of analog leads by generating Kv1.3 inhibitory IC50 values
for compounds inhibiting Kv1.3 >50% at 1 uM - using whole cell voltage-clamp protocol, and (b) select representative
leads for initial pharmaceutical profiling assays (solubility, permeability, microsomal stability, protein binding, and
efflux ratio). The 2nd Specific Aim is to (a) initiate iterative multi-parameter lead optimization campaign to improve
target potency and ADMET properties based on 2-4 structural classes which provided compounds with optimal
overall profiles emerging from Specific Aim 1; and (b) select representative leads possessing inhibitory Kv1.3 IC50
values < 100 nM and perform selectivity screen against Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and hERG ion channels. The 3rd Specific Aim
is to analyze SAR and cluster compounds with best overall balanced profiles and down-select to 2-3 lead scaffold
series of novel, potent and selective Kv1.3 Inhibitors which will serve as entry points for in vivo optimization of both
PK parameters and efficacy in rodent models of AD – to be funded with Phase 2 SBIR mechanism."

This project will complete the final design and development steps to commercialize the Fast In-Bed
Tracking (FIT) Platform, which is an e-Health and wellness Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system that
can be integrated into a user’s bed and provide person-centered, real-world outcomes to support health and
wellness. The technical feasibility of FIT was proven over the past several years and has demonstrated the
platform can support the treatment of several chronic conditions across different populations, including
obesity, congestive heart failure, and pressure injuries. The project goals will be to (1) complete design
refinements for FIT and (2) demonstrate the platform’s efficacy to support weight loss goals of wheelchair
users. Wheelchair users are twice as likely as the general population to be overweight or obese and excess
weight not only exacerbates mobility and participation limitations but increases risk for secondary health
problems. Evidence reveals that frequent weight monitoring is a key driver for weight management, which
puts wheelchair users at a significant disadvantage, because they have no convenient way to measure their
body weight. As a recent example, lack of participant’s ability to self-weigh was a noted limitation to a
weight loss program for wheelchair users, known as the Group Lifestyle Balance weight loss program
Adapted for Individuals with Impaired Mobility (GLB-AIM). FIT solves this challenge by passively monitoring
a user's weight when they get on and off their bed. Our lab and community-based feasibility trials
demonstrated that FIT successfully tracks weight for individuals and couples sharing a bed and that users
find FIT highly usable. This proposed project will allow our team to complete the design refinements users
recommended during our community-based feasibility trial and subsequently examine the efficacy of FIT in
supporting the weight-loss goals of community-dwelling wheelchair users through a randomized controlled
trial using the GLB-AIM."
10923800,"Background: Diabetes is a significant cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney and eye diseases, and
mortality. Diabetes and its complications also generate substantial healthcare utilization. Medications
contribute to both the benefits and costs of diabetes care. Newer diabetes medications have been developed
and marketed, but there remains a mismatch in our understanding of their net benefits, risks, and cost-
effectiveness. This is particularly relevant for older adults (≥65 years), where benefits and risks are more finely
balanced. Clinical practice guidelines recommend initial treatment with metformin across all age groups but are
unclear about next steps when metformin is ineffective. This is a frequent treatment transition. Medications
such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors
(SGLT2) have favorable effects on CVD and renal disease but also carry greater costs and side-effects. Within
VA, their usage is accelerating. It remains uncertain if these medications have specific advantages over the
frequently used generic medications, sulfonylureas (SU). Thus, we hypothesize that diabetes medication
usage is influenced by a complex interplay of patient factors and provider practice patterns. We further
hypothesize that when studied using real-world data, GLP1 and SGLT2 medications will reduce major adverse
outcomes and be cost-effective in comparison to SU when used as add-on treatment to metformin.
Significance: There are major gaps in the evidence base that informs clinical and cost-effective diabetes
treatment decisions among older Veterans (≥65 years), which comprise >70% of the VA diabetes cohort.
Innovation and Impact: We will employ a large nationwide sample of Veterans with diabetes who are dually
enrolled in VA/Medicare and apply advanced methods to reduce the impact of unmeasured factors. By using
real-world data, our study will add significant new information that informs the care of older Veterans, VA’s
diabetes and pharmacy programs, and clinical guidelines.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Determine prescribing patterns for SU, GLP1 and SGLT2. We will examine the extent to which patient
characteristics and clinician prescribing patterns influence initiating an SU, GLP1 or SGLT2 as add-on to
metformin.
Aim 2. Estimate the relationships between SU, GLP1, and SGLT2 usage as add-on to metformin with
healthcare utilization and adverse outcomes. Using clinician prescribing patterns as an instrumental variable,
we will measure the effects on emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, healthcare costs,
hypoglycemia events, medication adherence, new diabetes complications and mortality.
Aim 3. Investigate the cost-effectiveness of initiating an SU, GLP1 or SGLT2 as add-on to metformin.
Methodology: This is a retrospective observational study of secondary data from patient-level administrative
and claims data from VA and Medicare, and uses a quasi-experimental design involving instrumental variables.
We will conduct the cost-effectiveness analyses using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (CDM) v9.0, which is a
well-validated Markov model.
Next Steps/Implementation:
We will collaborate with Pharmacy Benefits Management Academic Detailing Service (ADS) and VA Specialty
Care Services (SCC) throughout the project. At its completion we will work with ADS and SCC to develop
education and dissemination plans to inform front-line clinicians, specialty-care leads and VA policymakers."

Occidiofungin is a cyclic nonribosomally synthesized antifungal peptide with submicromolar
fungicidal activity against drug resistant fungi. Optimization of the production and isolation of
occidiofungin from liquid cultures of this bacterium has been performed. Furthermore, detailed
structural determination, spectrum of activity, toxicity, and efficacy studies have been performed
on occidiofungin. Several benchmarks used to evaluate the development of a novel therapeutic
have been met with occidiofungin. Occidiofungin is a potent antifungal against fluconazole and
caspofungin-resistant Candida species. Occidiofungin triggers cell death by inducing apoptosis in
yeast cells. Occidiofungin has minimal toxicity in mice and GLP rodent micronucleus test (MNT)
demonstrated no genotoxicity. Additionally, occidiofungin was shown to be effective in treating
systemic and vaginal yeast infections in mice. All these studies point to the need to further the
preclinical development of this novel compound. Occidiofungin, along with very few antifungal
compounds, has met any of these benchmarks, and therefore it holds promise as a potential
antifungal therapeutic agent for the treatment of several fungal diseases. IND enabling studies for
an antifungal drug product to treat recurrent vulvovaginal yeast infections have been completed.
The goal of this application is to develop products for the treatment of drug resistant or recurrent
oral candidiasis (OC) and dermal candidiasis (DC). Establishing an effective formulation is
required before the toxicological and stability studies are performed as outlined in this proposal.
If the outlined studies prove to be successful, Sano Chemicals will file an IND application for an
occidiofungin based treatment for OC and DC infections."
10919357,"This project proposes to study the effects of new platinum anticancer drugs in pancreatic cancer. We suggest
that the unique combination of two research areas - the implication of the glycocalyx in modification of the tumor
extracellular matrix and the correlation of sensitivity of certain platinum agents with the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
status of the tumor – creates a unique profile amongst not just platinum agents but all currently used clinical
anticancer drugs. The critical unmet need in the treatment of pancreatic cancer is two-fold: 1) therapeutics to
effectively treat drug resistant disease and 2) predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit most
from the available therapies. Among chemotherapeutic drugs, platinum derivatives have a major importance in
the therapeutic arsenal and oxaliplatin is a critical component of the FOLFIRINOX regimen for treatment of
pancreatic cancer. Our studies show that tumors expressing high levels of chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) can be
exploited for enhanced cellular accumulation and tumor delivery of the Phase II polynuclear platinum complex
(PPC, specifically Triplatin) in breast and ovarian cancer PDX models because of the high affinity of the highly
cationic drug to the highly negative GAGs, a property not shared by mononuclear oxaliplatin. Biomarkers to
predict durable response to this drug were not available then, and further development of Triplatin was
suspended. Recently, we have demonstrated that Triplatin could be superior to the main line platinums against
tumors expressing high levels of chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S). C4S is a tumor-specific glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
attached to proteoglycans such as CD44, glypicans and syndecans, expressed on the cell surface and in tumor
stroma. The positive charge of Triplatin increases its affinity to the negatively charged GAG, which facilitates the
drug accumulation in the tumor cells and increases the level of Pt-DNA adducts. Interestingly, we noted that
carboplatin follows an opposite trend. Together, our studies support the premise that GAG levels can predict
carboplatin resistance and Triplatin sensitivity. Our central hypothesis is that high GAG levels in pancreatic
cancer can be exploited to increase Triplatin uptake and improve the efficacy of current treatment regimens. A
large research effort is ongoing to understand factors that influence the tumor response to therapy and to
evaluate strategies to overcome the treatment failure caused by intrinsic or acquired resistance. Studies aimed
at identification of the treatment targets for pancreatic cancer have mainly focused on mRNAs, miRNAs, and
proteins, while carbohydrates, such as GAGs, remain relatively unexplored. The non-template driven nature of
GAG biosynthesis involves a concerted action of multiple enzymes, complicating the analysis of expression at
the genomic/proteomic level and their role in clinical oncology. New technologies, such as glycan reductive
isotope labeling mass spectrometry (GRIL-MS), allow for quantitative and compositional analysis of GAGs in
tumor samples. Proof of this concept will pave the way for repurposing Triplatin for companion biomarker-
informed clinical trials."
10920247,"In this Phase I application, we introduce Cribsy, an innovative smartphone-based telehealth screener for neuromotor risks
in infants. Our team, with extensive experience in infant motor assessment and robust expertise in machine learning for
video analysis, aims to utilize our vast repository of annotated infant movement data to develop this user-friendly,
automated, at-home screening tool. In the US, 5-10% of children have a developmental disability,1,2,4 but fewer than a
third of them are diagnosed before school entry,3 preventing opportunities for early intervention. The risks of
developmental disorders, including those caused by neuromotor impairments, are particularly high for minorities – Black
(13.3%) and Hispanic (16.7%) infants are twice as likely as their White counterparts (6.5%) to be identified as high-risk
for developmental deficits.5 Research shows that children who are screened for developmental risks are more likely to be
identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate
milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits.9 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends motor
screening to identify at-risk infants at every well-child visit.10,11 Yet, parents skip more than 63% of the recommended 6
well-child visits in the first year.12 Parents in rural and underserved areas have even fewer visits.13 Delaying intervention
until the time of diagnosis may result in missed opportunities to intervene during the period of brain plasticity.22,23 Early
intervention saves up to $100k per child in social service costs.24
Several standardized, norm-referenced tools are available to the clinician for developmental assessments. However, fewer
than 10% of at-risk infants are being screened31 even at highly resourced care centers. The prevalence of at-risk infants far
outstrips the availability of clinicians trained to perform these developmental screening.32 With video conferencing tools
now commonplace post-pandemic, telehealth can expand access to screening for under-served families, but it does not
alleviate the need for trained personnel to execute these screenings synchronously. The innovative solution we are proposing
recruits the parent to acquire the home video data necessary for risk evaluation and employs AI-based methods to automate
video analysis to screen for developmental risks.
In Phase I, the goal is to fully develop Cribsy and transition it from its current limited prototype version to an impactful,
scalable AI system suitable for widespread infant risk screening. This requires attending to product features that promote
adoption as well as streamlining the machine learning processes to address real-world data challenges. Any AI system
encountering real world data runs into the problem of Data Drift, where the statistical properties of the variables the AI
model is trying to predict change in unforeseen ways. The input data properties can change due to device upgrades,
environmental factors, demographic changes, etc. In Phase I, we will develop systematic methods to continuously update
Cribsy’s AI models to address such drifts and optimize the methods for efficiency, stability, and cost. Using this
methodology, and by focusing on under-served communities, we aim to adequately represent minority populations in our
data models to address racial/cultural biases typically present in AI systems."
10920251,"The overall research program of the applicant has focused on the mechanisms underlying the increased
risk and worsened outcome of ischemic stroke in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a long-
term goal of finding therapies to improve blood perfusion and reduce secondary brain damage among these
patients. My current research program is an extension of a novel finding made from my lab showing that mice
with T2DM exhibited impaired leptomeningeal (LMA) collateral flow after stroke using optical imaging, mirroring
the finding in stroke patients with metabolic syndrome using CT-angiography. Through multiphoton imaging we
observed an increased leukocyte-platelet aggregates in the cerebral arterioles and increased leukocyte rolling
in cerebral veins following ischemic stroke in T2DM mice compared to normoglycemic control mice. These
events suggest that T2DM promotes neuroinflammation and formation of microthrombi after stroke and
contributes to poor cerebral perfusion and collateral flow. The applicant’s lab has made another crucial
discovery that T2DM mice exhibited defective type I and type II interferon signaling response, which attenuates
the induction of neuroprotective effect mediated by Toll-Like receptors. Since it is well known that age
diminishes the ability of many clinical therapies in inducing tolerance to ischemia, understanding the
pathological mechanisms contributing to the failure of ischemic preconditioning in T2DM may have a wide-
reaching impact on current clinically available conditioning paradigms that induce ischemic tolerance.
 To that end, the projects to be pursued during the proposed funding period of this RCS award are as
follows: 1). The current funded Merit Review grant of the applicant will determine the underlying pathological
mechanisms by which T2DM-induced chronic inflammation dampens the therapeutic effect of ischemic
tolerance induction. The goal is to find critical targets to overcome the interferon signaling defect in T2DM and
restore ischemic conditioning response. 2). To investigate how chronic inflammation caused by T2DM
exacerbates stroke induced secondary brain injury, we will determine the functional role of complement
components such as the anaphylatoxin receptors C3ar/C5ar, elevated in T2DM prior to stroke, in enhancing
the transmigration of peripheral immune cells after stroke. Our study will also discern whether T2DM
chronically affects brain resident myeloid cells and increases their potential in attacking neurons and synapses
after stroke. 3). To determine the therapeutic efficacy of interventions based on pharmacological, behavioral, or
electrical stimulation in restoring neural regeneration, brain connectivity and function after ischemic stroke.
The research proposed for the next funding period will continue to support the mission of VA Healthcare
through studies that will facilitate the translational development of potential therapeutic interventions in
improving stroke outcome among service personnel and veterans with diabetes."

 This T32 training program was established in 2014 to train the next generation of pre- and post-
doctoral scholars in the prevention, treatment, and care of HIV and substance use among individuals
involved with the criminal legal system (CLS). The training program is a partnership between the Columbia
University School of Social Work (SSW) and the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH), with strong
support from longstanding partnerships with a number of research centers, schools, and departments at
Columbia University. We propose to renew the program by continuing its unique position as the only
NIDA-funded T32 program jointly run out of a school of social work and school of public health as well as
the successful administration and activities; the renewal will maintain that last cycle’s emphasis on
implementation and augment the program in: (1) community engagement, and (2) data science. The
training program provides: (1) interdisciplinary research instruction and training for pre-doctoral students
and post-doctoral fellows on the intersecting issues of substance use, HIV, implementation science,
community engagement, and data science with the CLS and CLS-involved populations; and (2) hands-on,
mentored experience conducting independent research in the program’s banner themes. This program is
designed to strengthen the pool of researchers by increasing the diversity of academic backgrounds—e.g.,
social work, public health, medicine, sociology, political science, anthropology—and those from
underrepresented populations—e.g., underrepresented minorities (URM), people with disabilities,
individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The participating faculty are scientific leaders in the fields of
CLS, HIV, substance use, implementation science, community engagement, and data science, with strong
track records of support from NIH; they are also well-qualified to provide training, as evidenced by their
strong records of mentorship of pre- and post-doctoral early career scholars. At capacity, the program
supports 4 pre-doctoral students and 4 post-doctoral trainees per year (a total of 6-8 pre-doctoral trainees
and 8-10 post-doctoral trainees in the renewal period). Thus, the program will add a substantial number of
highly qualified new scholars to the field focusing on HIV, substance use, implementation science,
community engagement, and data science among CLS-involved populations. Dr. Nabila El-Bassel and Dr.
Lisa Metsch will continue to serve successfully as PIs/Co-Directors for the proposed training program,
which provides an opportunity for two noted and distinguished scientists to collaborate and lead this
initiative. They contribute over 30 years each of experience in the program’s banner themes, shepherded
impressive growth in success in the program’s most recent cycle of funding, and will provide continuity in
leadership for the proposed renewal."
10918693,"Project Abstract/Summary
Over 9000 people die of Melanoma in the United States every year [1]. It is the most
common skin cancer. However, not all are affected equally. While white patients have a
higher incidence rate, patients of color have a significantly higher fatality rate once
melanoma develops [2]. Even the darkest skin tones with the greatest amount of
melanin are not protected from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. DNA damage from UV light
can be measured in all skin types and all skin types may develop melanoma from DNA
damage [3]. While chemical sunscreens have made progress toward removing
aesthetic concerns, these chemicals can enter the bloodstream with uncertain health
effects. Physical sunscreens based on ZnO/TiO2 do not have the same risk, however
the white/”ashy” appearance on darker skin limits their adoption.
This proposal is for the development of a physical sunscreen based on the non-toxic,
biocompatible, and naturally occurring polyester poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) that is by
nature less whitening than physical sunscreens on the market, allowing for greater
adoption by individuals with darker skin. PHB is part of the natural carbon cycle and
readily biodegrades in marine environments. Light transmission through PHB’s crystal
structure increases with increasing wavelength; PHB blocks up to much more UV light
than visible light, giving it a less white appearance than minerals that reflect visible light.
The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Produce and isolate PHB for sunscreen
formulation; 2) Obtain a range of particle and crystal spherulite sizes by varying spray
drying/annealing parameters; and 3) to study the effects of particle size and spherulite
size on UV light transmission and sensory acceptance (specifically grittiness).
It is important to design sunscreen products that address the tone issues while limiting
uncertain health/environmental risks. Making sunscreen that is inclusive of all skin tones
will help increase application to all ethnicities equally and will help lessen the health gap
by reducing the mortality rate of people of color who develop melanoma. Our innovation
will address these issues and is superior to other sunscreens. Our innovative sunscreen
is designed to be (1) bio-based and biodegradable making it (2) a safe and healthy
option, (3) that doesn’t have a perceivable tone on any skin color, and (4) has removes
the negative environmental impact that is associated with many sunscreens on the
market today."
10918733,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Intensive research of the past few decades demonstrated that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-
infected individuals develop severe hematopathologies, including anemia, thrombocytopenia,
pancytopenia, and bone marrow failure. Even though a great deal of information is available on HIV-
induced hematopoietic defects in people living with HIV, hematopathologies caused by in-utero exposure
of HIV in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children remains largely unknown. Particularly, physiological
impact of maternal exposure of HIV on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of HEU infants remain
completely unknown. A vast majority of HEU children have higher risk of opportunistic infections within
the first 6 months of life. Indeed, HEU infants have 2- to 4- fold higher mortality rate, largely due to
respiratory infections and bacterial sepsis, when compared with HIV-unexposed uninfected (HU) infants.
Emerging evidence establish a strong link between HIV-1 and HSCs of the bone marrow. More
importantly, antiretroviral treatments result in incomplete rescue of hematopoiesis and immune functions
in patients living with HIV infection. Overall, these studies provide a compelling rationale for further
investigations into cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to immune dysfunctions and
increased susceptibilities to microbial infections in HEU children. To this end, research proposed here
aims to unravel the physiologic impact of in-utero HIV exposure on HSC maintenance and myeloid
differentiation and to identify the upstream mechanisms through which HIV exposure impairs HSCs in
HEU children. The major hypothesis of this study is that self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs
are compromised in HEU children, most likely due to HIV-associated chronic inflammation,
which eventually results in defective peripheral immune functions. To test our hypothesis,
we will use a combination of xenotransplantation, in-vitro culture, molecular cell biology, biochemical and
spectral flow cytometry studies. In the first specific aim, we would investigate the physiological and
molecular alterations caused by HIV-exposure on HSCs. In the second specific aim, we would assess
myeloid differentiation capacities of HEU-HSCs and evaluate the functions of HEU-HSC-derived DCs
and macrophages to mount effective immune responses against respiratory infections. In the third
specific aim, we would identify the cellular source of inflammation and evaluate the therapeutic benefit of
inhibiting inflammatory circuits in HEU infants. Studies proposed in Aims 1, 2 & 3 are complimentary and
informed by the data of each other, but not dependent on the outcome of the other Aims. We believe that
studies described here would be of major clinical relevance as it attempts to unravel the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for increased morbidities and mortalities in HEU children."
10925536,"Using intracortical microelectrodes to record brain signals can provide valuable insight into brain functions and
treatment plans for neurological disorders. However, microelectrode performance is significantly affected by the
neuroinflammatory response following implantation largely resulting from blood-brain barrier damage and leaky
constituents following implantation. Among these constituents, the role of penetrated microorganisms such as
bacteria on neuroinflammation remains unclear. In contrast to other areas of the body, it is possible for the brain
to respond to very low concentrations of bacteria that do not manifest as systemic infections but may induce
neuroinflammatory response in the brain due to its higher sensitivity. Even with an appropriate sterilization, a
very low level of bacteria can still migrate into the incision site or enter the brain from other internal sources such
as the bloodstream throughout the implantation process. Indefinite delivery of systemic antibiotics has found to
be ineffective in treating low levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and can alter the composition and population
of existing, stable strains of bacteria, that are symbiotic to human health. Thus, the development of a localized
method to modulate bacteria levels may be a critical step towards reducing the neuroinflammatory response
following microelectrode implantation.
Our preliminary data show that neuroinflammatory responses to intracortical microelectrodes can be
exacerbated by bacterial contamination (even at very low abundance); Systemic antibiotics resulted in decreased
recording performance and increased neuroinflammatory response as a significantly more robust
neuroinflammatory response than control was observed by 12 weeks of implantation. Also, live bacteria were
found in the tissue adjacent the implants at 12 weeks post-implantation. Our preliminary data also showed that
titania nanotube arrays (TNAs) prevented bacterial growth and maintained sustained local antibiotics delivery for
>12 weeks. In this proposal, we aim to explore the antimicrobial properties of the TNA coatings in relation to their
effect on bacterial populations and the neuroinflammatory response following intracortical probe implantation as
well as investigate the potential outcomes of local versus systemic antibiotic delivery in controlling resistant
bacteria. A pilot study using Neuronexus recording probes coated with TNAs on their backside will be performed
to evaluate the mechanical integrity of TNA coatings in vivo as well as their effect on recording performance."

This project encompasses a multi-disciplinary team of basic scientists and clinical investigators dedicated to 
finding effective new therapies for patients with cancer. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer 
Center (OSUCCC) is a comprehensive biomedical research campus with strong collaborations between 
experienced investigators from multiple oncologic disciplines and a vibrant pattern of discovery in the basic 
sciences. For the purposes of this proposal, the OSUCCC will partner with investigators at the University of
Kentucky Markey Cancer Center (MCC) and the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) with whom 
they have had a strong relationships in the past. These sites provide access to a large population of cancer
patients that requires access to cancer clinical trials, many of whom reside in rural areas such as Appalachia or 
the American West. Under the leadership of Dr. William Carson, a surgeon with experience in immune therapy, 
and Translational Scientist Dr. Jennifer Woyach, a hematologic oncologist with skill in developing targeted 
therapies, this highly integrated team will explore novel therapeutic agents and treatment modalities, test new 
immune-based therapies, evaluate drug resistance mechanisms and explore the promise of genomic profiling of 
the cancer cell in order to develop more effective treatments for cancer. Notably, investigators in this 
experimental therapeutics program have been engaged in the conduct of phase I/II cancer studies for decades 
and are experienced in the design and conduct of correlative laboratory studies that can confirm the ability of a 
new drug to hit a specific molecular target and define a precise mechanism of action. Ohio State has collaborated 
extensively with other cancers centers dedicated to experimental therapeutics and will continue to do so within 
the context of the UM1 mechanism. The existence of strong laboratory bench research and pharmacology at 
each site will ensure that this group of translational investigators will continue to generate new concepts for 
submission within the NCI’s Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) mechanism. A major 
goal of this consortium is to accrue over 100 patients per year to ETCTN studies and in the last grant year 102
enrollments were recorded in a variety of cancer types. Of prime importance to this consortium is the education 
and training of early career investigators so that they are prepared to lead new translational studies. Indeed, 
each of the last six studies from this clinical research group has had an early career investigator as its leader. 
The experience, diversity and cohesiveness of this research team combined with an unwavering commitment to 
ETCTN goals and principles will position it for continued success and innovation within this exciting clinical 
research mechanism."
10913640,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in carcinogenesis, in part due its ability to promote immune 
suppressive properties within tumors. It remains unclear whether inhibition of fatty acid metabolism in tumors 
affects their immunogenicity. We show that inhibition of stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate limiting 
enzyme involved in fatty-acid synthesis converting saturated acids (SFA) to monounsaturated fatty acids 
(MUFAs), increases the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic tumors. Our results indicate that inhibition of 
tumorigenic de novo lipogenesis represents a novel approach to enhance T cell-based cancer 
immunotherapy. In so doing, our novel lead SCD1 inhibitor (MTI-301; aka SSI-4) singly, and in combination with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using immune competent mouse models demonstrates anti-tumor synergy 
sensitizing tumors to ICIs, as a prelude to an early phase clinical trial. We will also optimize efficacy and seek 
predictive biomarkers of response that could be useful for the design and stratification of patients in the critical 
Phase III clinical trial. SCD1 is universally upregulated in aggressive cancers and validated by MTI-301 antitumor 
activity across a broad range of cancer cell lines and tumor mouse models. Mechanistically, MUFA deprivation 
in addicted cancer cells leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediating apoptotic cell death. We 
discovered using immune competent mouse cancer models that MTI-301 activates the adaptive immune 
response via calreticulin/PERK arm of the ER stress pathway enhancing activated T cell tumor infiltration and 
thereby promoting anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Combined with anti-PD1 inhibitor, MTI-301 sensitizes tumors to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors in mouse triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2 breast cancer mouse 
models. Based upon these data, our central hypothesis is that aberrant de novo lipogenesis is linked to 
attenuation of tumor immunogenicity. Three aims are proposed in this fast-track Phase 1/2 SBIR proposal. In 
Aim 1 (Milestone 1, Phase I SBIR), GLP dog toxicology study will be completed to identify the No-observedadverse-effect level (NOAEL) enabling calculation of the first in human dose for the phase I clinical trial. In Aim 
2 (Milestone 2, Phase II SBIR), GMP MTI-301 will be synthesized and capsulated along with submission of the 
investigation of new drug (IND) application for FDA Phase I trial approval. In Aim 3 (Milestone 3, Phase II SBIR), 
a Phase I clinical trial will be performed and exploratory biomarkers including identification of immune infiltrates 
into the tumor site will be assessed. In summary, we envision SCD1 as a broad-spectrum anti-cancer target 
overexpressed in aggressive malignancies. Therapeutically useful, MTI-301 increases the immunogenicity of 
poorly immunogenic tumors thereby sensitizing to immune checkpoint blockade, leading to dramatic adaptive 
immune mediated tumor cell killing. This combination therapy should enhance patient response rates and be 
well tolerated in patients."

 Astrocytes react to brain injury with progressive changes in gene expression, morphological hypertrophy,
and proliferation referred as astrogliosis. The beneficial or detrimental effects of proliferative reactive astrocytes
are constantly under debate, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Our long-term
goal is to dissect the mechanisms underlying the proliferation of reactive astrocytes and its biological function in
the hippocampus after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and in order to find the vital targets for TBI treatment. The
objective of this grant is to determine the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR) signaling
in regulating reactive astrocyte proliferation and the neuroprotective effects of proliferative reactive astrocytes in
hippocampus-associated functional outcomes post-trauma. The central hypothesis is proliferative reactive
astrocytes regulated by PDGFR mediated signaling pathway are neuroprotective by favoring synapse
preservation and regeneration following TBI. The rationale underlying this proposal is that completion
mechanism study will provide an ideal tool to study the function of proliferative reactive astrocyte in the
hippocampus and which in turn to identify vital targets for therapeutic intervention aiming at functional
improvement after TBI. The central hypothesis will be addressed with pursuing three specific aims. 1) Determine
the role of proliferative reactive astrocytes on synaptic alteration and functional outcomes following TBI; and
study PDGFR-mediated signaling pathway in reactive astrocyte proliferation; 2) Determine how proliferative
reactive astrocyte play its neuroprotective role in synapse preservation and regeneration following TBI; 3)
Determine the neuroprotective effects of astrocytic BDNF overexpression and long-term treatment with BDNF
agonist, a small molecule 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) on synapse preservation/regeneration and function
improvement after TBI. The proposed research is innovative because we reveal for the first time the role of
PDGFRin regulating reactive astrocyte proliferation post-trauma using state-of-art inducible conditional
knockout/knockin technique and discover the neuroprotective aspects of proliferative reactive astrocytes in
injured hippocampus. The results will have an important positive impact because they will augment our
knowledge on the pathophysiology of TBI, and may offer a novel intervention for better TBI treatment by
selectively manipulating reactive astrocytes at the proliferation stage with neuroprotective effects that counteract
synapse loss and facilitate synaptogenesis post-trauma."
10897104,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Poor survival rates are largely 
due to the late stage at which PDAC is diagnosed and a lack of effective targeted therapies. While the field of 
immunotherapy has significantly increased overall survival in some malignancies, they have not translated to 
PDAC. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a novel cancer vaccine for the treatment of 
PDAC. Preliminary studies by our group and others have shown that the Anterior Gradient-2 (AGR2) protein, a 
member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, is induced during PDAC oncogenesis and highly 
expressed in >90% of PDAC patients. AGR2 has intracellular oxidative folding function and is also released from 
the cell where it localizes to the surface of PDAC cells and is shed into the tumor microenvironment. We 
hypothesize that AGR2 is an actionable target for the development of a PDAC targeted vaccine and will test that 
theory using a new immunotherapy drug candidate. Streptococcal Mitogenic Exotoxin Z-2 (SMEZ-2) from 
Streptococcus pyogenes is a bacterial superantigen (SAg) that binds to MHC II molecules on antigen presenting 
cells (APCs) with high affinity. In preliminary studies we generated a detoxified AGR2-SMEZ-2 conjugate that 
we hypothesize will stimulate a robust anti-PDAC immune response. We found in preliminary studies that AGR2-
SMEZ-2 generates a robust anti-AGR2 response in mice and displays no overt toxicity. The objectives of Phase 
1 of this study are: (1) to demonstrate anti-PDAC efficacy of AGR2-SMEZ-2 in vivo, and (2) to measure B and T 
cell biomarkers of an anti-AGR2 response in vaccinated mice. Upon success in Phase 1, the objectives of Phase 
2 of this study are: (1) to show synergy between AGR2-SMEZ-2 vaccination and checkpoint inhibition in vivo, 
(2) to compare the superior immunogenicity of SMEZ-2 mediated through MHC II-specific binding over existing 
vaccine carrier proteins, and (3) to determine the optimal dose, schedule, and toxicology profile of AGR2-SMEZ-2 in vivo. This work is innovative because we will investigate the anti-PDAC mechanism of our proprietary AGR2-
SMEZ-2 vaccine and characterize the induced immune response in different mouse models. This work will 
support the development of a first-in-class vaccine for the treatment of PDAC, a cancer with few existing 
therapies. In addition, we expect that this study will allow for other immunotherapies (namely checkpoint 
inhibition) to become effective in providing a PDAC response in patients."
10928225,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes chronic neuroinflammation with progressive neurodegeneration and may ultimately lead to Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s Disease-related dementia and long-term neurocognitive dysfunctions. Emerging evidence suggests that bi-directional brain-systemic interactions contribute to these neuropathological changes. Notably, TBI causes gastrointestinal (GI) tract pathology and GI diseases are associated with neurological dysfunctions. We hypothesize that brain trauma and colitis interact to promote a persistent microglia dysregulation/neuroinflammation that drives the development of Alzheimer’s disease-type neuropathology with progressive tissue loss and cognitive decline. 
TBI-induced GI damage is common, correlates with injury severity and may include mucosal injury, intestinal barrier disruption and dysmotility. The enteric nervous system (ENS) and enteric glial cells (EGCs) regulate mucosal barrier homeostasis. We reported that moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) in mice, a well-characterized experimental TBI model, induces increased EGCs gliogenesis/reactivity and causes delayed, chronic mucosal barrier dysfunction in the colon. These changes may explain the increased risk for enteric infections in brain trauma patients. Moreover, an enteric infection during the chronic period after TBI resulted in increased colonic mucosal barrier impairment compared to infections in non-injured animals. Importantly, the enteric infection positively interacted with TBI secondary injury mechanisms and significantly exacerbated posttraumatic neuroinflammation and related neurodegeneration.
Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease is the most common human neurodegenerative disease; however, a proper understanding of the underlaying processes as well as the availability and efficacy of disease-modifying interventions is lacking. Alzheimer’s Disease is a polygenic and environmentally influenced disease with many risk factors acting in concert to produce disease processes. The strongest genetic risk factors include the 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) and point mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) locus. Clinical studies have found that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk for subsequent development of Alzheimer’s Disease. Furthermore, our preliminary data show that microglia, the principal TREM2 expressing cell population in the brain, undergo a persistent shift toward activated phenotypes following TBI that are characterized by both TREM2 and ApoE overexpression. Intriguingly, increasing evidence suggests that reciprocal communication between the enteric and the central nervous system, termed the brain-gut axis, plays a key role in neurodegenerative disease. Thus, population-based cohort studies demonstrate a significant association between inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and subsequent development of dementia. Importantly, among dementia types, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia demonstrated the greatest increase in IBD patients compared to controls. 
We propose that, mild-TBI and colitis synergize to promote the development of chronic neurodegenerative processes, causing delayed central inflammation, hippocampal neuronal loss and neurobehavioral dysfunctions and manifesting as Alzheimer’s disease-type neuropathology. A critical question is what underlying mechanisms drive the brain-gut pathological interactions after TBI and lead to chronic neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurocognitive deficits that result in an Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s Disease-related dementia. The proposed studies will probe the novel concept that therapeutic strategies that target GI tract mechanisms may limit brain disease processes, including neurodegeneration, and thus attenuate chronic cognitive decline and the development of Alzheimer’s disease-type neuropathology after TBI.
Our central hypotheses are: 1) TBI causes chronic dysfunctions in brain-gut axis, priming increased pathological responses after late enteric challenges including activation in microglia of molecular responses such as Trem2 and ApoE, which are known to play important roles in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease; 2) Targeting ENS/EGCs or microglial activity promotes brain-gut homeostasis, attenuating brain neuroinflammation and specific microglial mechanisms that may drive Alzheimer’s disease-like processes, thus reducing dementia, neurodegeneration and neurocognitive deficits.
AIM1: Elucidate the mechanisms of chronic EGCs changes after mouse TBI and demonstrate that EGC modulators attenuate enteric pathology and neuropathology in the chronic phase after TBI. 
AIM2: Examine the ability of ECGs activity modulators to limit colon injury and neurodegeneration after combined mild-TBI+colitis. 
AIM3: Show that mild-TBI primes central microglia to develop a dysfunctional pro-inflammatory response to a later enteric challenge."
10928226,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Characterizing the structures and interactions of biomolecules and their complexes is of fundamental
importance in human physiology, disease, and therapeutics. Many of the advances of the last century in these
areas are attributed to improvements in bioanalytical techniques and controlling the processes that underlie
them. For example, x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cryoelectron
microscopy have achieved atomic-level resolution of the structure of many thousands of proteins and protein
complexes, and these methods are often complemented by Molecular Dynamics studies to further understand
biomolecule structure and reactivity. However, these methods can be challenging to use for very small or highly
heterogeneous samples or samples that require a membrane environment. Native Ion Mobility-Mass
Spectrometry (IM-MS) is a complementary technique that ionizes and transfers intact biomolecules and
complexes directly from buffered, aqueous solution into the gas-phase for mass and shape/size analysis, and
modern sample preparation and data analysis methods make it highly suitable for membrane proteins in lipid
environments as well as heterogeneous and polydisperse samples. In commonly available IM-MS
instrumentation, Collision Induced Dissociation and Unfolding are used to activate native biomolecular ions by
colliding them repeatedly with neutral buffer gas until they dissociate or unfold, and recently-introduced Surface
Induced Dissociation and Unfolding activate ions via a single, controlled collision with a hard surface inside the
mass spectrometer. These native IM-MS methods can be extremely useful for profiling the composition, size,
and shape of biomolecules and their complexes with exquisite chemical specificity, sensitivity, and speed.
However, two major hurdles to the use of these methods for accurate, quantitative interpretation of biomolecule
domain, surface, and interface structure are the lack of a flexible, robust method for computing and interpreting
the energy required to induce the observed structural changes and a dearth of reliable benchmark values. Here,
we tackle these challenges with a combined computational and experimental approach aimed at producing a
“universal,” validated ion activation model that can be readily used for across many commonly used native MS
and IM-MS platforms and by producing a benchmark library for prototypical local and large-scale interactions
that govern protein unfolding, dissociation, and surface labeling. Expected outcomes include open-source,
publicly available software for researchers world-wide to model unfolding/dissociation energetics for their own
samples, heuristics for the design of effective gas-phase surface-labeling reagents, and a quantitative
understanding of cataract-associated human eye lens protein heterooligomerization as a case study. The long-
term goal of the project is to facilitate the acquisition and interpretation of decisive structural and dynamical
information for a wide range of biomolecules and complexes relevant to human health."
10928233,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
The emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has motivated many 
computational methods to study gene regulation and cell differentiation at the single-cell level. However, to 
improve the translational value of scRNA-seq, new methods are required to comparatively study the 
molecular differences between normal and pathological cells/tissues, and between control and 
case/treatment groups. The vast majority of existing network and clustering models have focused on 
scRNA-seq data generated under one experimental condition. Moreover, most existing scRNA-seq network 
models are correlative in nature and do not infer causality. What remains lacking are rigorous statistical 
methods for inference of differential causal gene regulation and cell composition in response to 
experimental interventions. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop novel methodologies for 
identifying the effects of experimental interventions on causal gene regulatory relationships and cell 
differentiation by jointly modeling scRNA-seq data across experimental groups. Without such tools, 
mechanistically understanding gene regulatory activities and cell differentiation will likely remain difficult. 
Our overall objective is to design and validate Bayesian network and clustering models for identifying 
differential causal gene regulatory networks and cell composition for scRNA-seq data generated under 
different experimental conditions. To achieve the overall objective, three specific aims will be pursued: 
Aim 1: Develop a differential zero-inflated negative binomial Bayesian network model to construct 
differential cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks under two experimental conditions. 
Aim 2: Develop a trajectory-dependent directed cyclic graph model to construct cell-specific causal 
networks with feedback loops and monitor its structural changes with cell development. 
Aim 3: Develop a scalable Bayesian semiparametric differential clustering method to discover differential 
cell composition and cell-type-specific marker genes that are shared and/or unique to each experimental 
group."
10925734,"The product we are developing, Fc3/SCR(19-20), is a protein of our own design that will be administered
as a yearly shot to prevent two tick-borne diseases, Lyme Disease (LD) and Relapsing Fever (RF). Unlike
vaccines, it does not depend on stimulating the immune system, and thus should be equally effective in both
healthy and immunocompromised recipients. We have shown that Fc3/SCR(19-20), injected into mice, prior to
exposure to infected ticks, reduces the transmission of LD bacteria to the treated mice. For yearly Fc3/SCR(19-
20) injections to become a practical strategy for preventing tick-borne diseases in people, we need to improve
the bioavailability, safety and longevity of the protein in the body, so that it provides effective season-long
protection at a lower dose.
 To achieve these three objectives, this project brings together two research groups, each with their own
unique qualifications. Under the direction of the PI, Planet Biotechnology (PBI), using plants grown in an indoor
facility, will produce multiple variants of Fc3/SCR(19-20), with the goal of enhancing bioavailability, safety and
longevity of protection. PBI has pioneered methods for producing, purifying and improving the function of proteins
like Fc3/SCR(19-20) using a plant transient expression system, including the first plant-produced antibody tested
in clinical trials. A research group at the New York State Department of Health, led by Dr Yi-Pin Lin, will test the
relative ability of these new Fc3/SCR(19-20) variants to kill LD and RF bacteria in vitro and to block transmission
of LD bacteria into mice from infected ticks. They will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
of Fc3/SCR(19-20) in mice, in order to determine the duration of protection.
 Ultimately, we aim to develop Fc3/SCR(19-20) as an FDA-approved drug, for annual administration as an
injection, to provide protection against LD and RF through a full tick season. Untreated, these diseases can have
significant long-term health consequences. We expect that widespread adoption of our preventive strategy would
significantly improve the quality of life for anyone living or working in high LD or RF risk areas. Although our focus
now is on prevention, it is possible that Fc3/SCR(19-20) could be effective as a treatment for LD as well.
 To achieve FDA marketing approval, Fc3/SCR(19-20) will need to go through all of the pre-clinical and
clinical testing typical of a biotechnology-derived new drug. Assuming successful completion of all the aims of the
proposed project, follow-on studies will determine the minimally effective dose in rhesus monkeys (to predict the
effective dose in humans), evaluate the long-term safety of Fc3/SCR(19-20) in rats and monkeys, and undergo
rigorous clinical testing. We project that Fc3/SCR(19-20) could be commercially available in 5-6 years.
 Fc3/SCR(19-20) targets (and blocks) a mechanism that LD and RF bacteria normally use to evade the
host immune response, so development of bacterial resistance may be less likely than with a monoclonal antibody."
10922253,"ABSTRACT:
Fibrotic disorders represent a major health problem in the U.S., with a rising incidence (particularly among the
elderly). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentless and fatal fibrotic disease, characterized by progressive
scar tissue formation in the lungs, resulting in respiratory failure. There are two FDA-approved oral drugs for IPF,
which offer only modest improvements in slowing the lung function decline and patient survival. One possible
explanation for the limited therapies available is that age-dependent pathologic mechanisms remain largely
unexploited in the drug development process, despite the fact that aging has been strongly implicated in the
pathogenesis of IPF. We were the first to demonstrate that the key effector cells in fibrogenesis, myofibroblasts,
exhibit redox imbalance in aging; this is in part regulated by a deficient induction of a master regulator of
antioxidant responses, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2). Human patients with IPF exhibit
decreased Nrf2 expression in myofibroblastic foci, supporting this cellular redox imbalance in fibrotic disease.
We have also demonstrated that in contrast to self-limited, resolving fibrosis in young mice, aged mice exhibit
defective Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses, which promote age-dependent persistent lung fibrosis. These
findings may help to explain why fibrotic disorders are more prevalent among the elderly. Although therapeutic
strategies targeting Nrf2 to treat IPF hold promise, the systemic delivery of Nrf2 activators has been stymied by
safety concerns. A breakthrough in this field may lie in the repurposing of Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an FDA-
approved oral drug for multiple sclerosis known to activate Nrf2. Recently, we have demonstrated that inhaled
DMF treatment restores Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and promotes reversal of established lung fibrosis
at just a fraction of the oral dose in an aging murine model. Although we have demonstrated important proof-of-
concept for the repurposing of DMF as inhaled therapy for IPF, the clinical translatability of inhaled Nrf2 therapy
for IPF remains unknown. This Phase 1 STTR application pivots to the exploration of three FDA-approved Nrf2
activators (DMF, diroximel fumarate, and monomethyl fumarate) as repurposed inhaled therapy for IPF. The
goal of the proposed study is to assess the clinical translatability of inhaled Nrf2 therapy for IPF by evaluating
the pharmacology and toxicology of lung-targeted Nrf2 activator therapy in rodent models. Aim 1 will evaluate
the efficacy of three FDA-approved Nrf2 activators in human ex vivo model using bioactive precision cut lung
slices and nominate the top candidate. Aim 2 will characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles. Aim 3 will determine
the therapeutic index and maximum tolerated dose of the top candidate (identified from Aims 1-2). To date, no
therapeutics have been shown to reverse age-associated established fibrosis, which may represent the holy
grail for therapeutic strategies to more effectively treat IPF. We hypothesize that therapeutic strategies targeting
age-associated pathologic mechanisms (e.g. age-dependent defective Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses)
offer the greatest potential for developing successful IPF treatments."

10918480,"ABSTRACT
Muco-obstructive lung diseases, e.g., COPD, asthma, CF, and PCD, cause major health problems to many
citizens of the US. Recent CT data have identified mucus plugging as a major contributor to the pathogenesis
and mortality of muco-obstructive lung diseases, including COPD. Ironically in 2023, there are no therapeutic
agents available dedicated to the clearance of mucus plugs from patients in need. CT data demonstrating that
mucus plugs persist in COPD subjects for > 3 yrs suggest that current COPD therapeutics are not helpful in
mucus clearance. A combination of in vitro biophysical studies and clinical research studies over the past decade
have established that mucus plugging is a predictable consequence of the increased mucus concentration.
Increased mucus concentration typically reflects defects in the epithelial ion/fluid transport pathways that control
mucus hydration. A rational therapeutic strategy to clear mucus plugs from the lungs of patients in need is to
rehydrate the accumulated, hyperconcentrated mucus. This application is designed to support the enabling
studies of a novel mucus hydrator combination therapy, including a next-generation ENaC blocker (P-1155)
formulated with an osmolyte, to IND status. The medicinal chemistry design of P-1155 builds off the success in
the clinic of the P-1037/hypertonic saline (HS) combination for the chronic therapy of primary ciliary dyskinesia
(PCD). The P-1037/HS experience strongly emphasizes the importance of both: 1) an osmolyte for effective
clinical activity; and 2) high protein binding for a high degree of extra-renal excretion and, hence, safety. Based
on the perceived need for a rapidly active muco-kinetic agent for the treatment of both stable and exacerbating
COPD or asthmatic subjects, P-1155 has been modified to accelerate the kinetics of onset of action while
preserving P-1037 safety attributes. Two specific aims encompass a two-phase development plan. Phase I will
select the osmolyte for co-formulation with P-1155, the choices being NaGluconate vs HS/Sulfobutylether-β-
Cyclodextrin (SBECD), based on: 1) P-1155 formulation/stability studies; and 2) efficacy studies in a muco-
obstructive mouse model. Phase II will include IND-required aerosol formulation, ADME/PK studies, and a 28-
day GLP rat inhalation toxicology study. Accordingly, the application proposes two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Phase I studies designed to select a P-1155 formulation.
 SA1A: P-1155 formulation and stability studies.
 SA1B: 7/28d βENaC muco-obstructive mouse model efficacy studies.
Specific Aim 2: Phase II studies designed to advance a P-1155 formulation to an IND.
 SA2A: Aerosol delivery formulation studies of P-1155/osmolyte solutions.
 SA2B: ADME/PK studies, including hepatic excretion, plasma protein binding, and P-1155 metabolism.
 SA2C: 28d rat GLP inhalation toxicology study of selected P-1155 formulation.
The ultimate goal of the SBIR submission is to file an IND for P-1155 focused on subjects with COPD."
10918543,"To cure and control Tuberculosis (TB) disease we need shorter, simpler and safer therapies. The goal is to
develop therapies of low pill burden; of shorter duration (ideally 2-3 months); with 3-4 drug regimens that avoid
resistance and of limited toxicity. Today test regimens are identified in preclinical in vitro and animal models and
the most promising multi-drug regimens are subsequently evaluated as a unit in clinical trials. This strategy was
used to develop one of the most successful TB regimens so far; the 6moBPaL regimen (a 6-month all oral drug
regimen consisting of bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa) and linezolid (L)) Unfortunately, a high rate of adverse
events associated with long-term administration of linezolid (a protein synthesis inhibitor) was also reported with
this regimen. An option to improve the BPaL regimen is to replace L with spectinamides, another protein synthesis
inhibitor without oral bioavailability but an excellent safety profile and with potent efficacy against drug sensitive
(DS) and multidrug or extensively drug resistant (MDR-XDR) Mtb strains. The preclinical lead compound 1810
(backup 1599) administered in vivo as injectable, or directly into the lungs via aerosol, demonstrated potent
synergistic effects with other oral TB drugs. Moving forward, we propose to develop new 3-4 drug regimens
consisting of spectinamide (S) administered via aerosol and combined with BPa (aka: BPaS regimen) and BPaS
in combination with pyrazinamide (Z) (aka: BPaSZ regimen). We have shown that 4-weeks of BPaS treatment
resulted in similar bactericidal effect to that of the BPaL regimen in BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice. Moreover, the
BPaS regimen avoided the myelosuppression and anemia observed in mice treated with BPaL. Our preliminary
data also suggests that sterility with BPaS is possible. The studies proposed here test inhalational therapies
with spectinamides within new regimens of TB therapy for treatment of DS-TB and MDR-XDR TB. (Aim 1)
We had produced small quantities of dry powder 1810 (DP1810) for inhalation and here we will manufacture and
physico-chemically characterize larger scale of DP1810 and evaluate their aerodynamic performance for human
or animal use. Aim 2 will use pharmacokinetics studies to determine the optimal dose level and dosing frequency
for regimens BPaS and BPaSZ. Aim 3, using BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ TB models will assess the efficacy and
sterilization potential of BPaS and BPaSZ regimens. Aim 4 will develop PK/PD simulation-based allometric scaling
to aid in human dose projections. Finally, in preparation for the IND preclinical package, Aim 5 will develop non-
GLP toxicologic dose range finding studies in rats after inhaled DP1810 administration. Our Multi-PI team led by
Dr. Gonzalez-Juarrero at CSU, Dr. Hickey from the RTI International, and Dr. Meibohm at the University of
Tennessee will work together with experts in TB drug modeling, TB drug combinations and clinical pathology
experts (Drs. Lyons, Robertson and McNeil at CSU respectively), medicinal chemistry (Dr. Lee at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital) and a world expert physician in TB therapy (Dr. Daley at National Jewish Health)

10918510,"Overview. The goal of this project is to develop a multilevel HIV prevention approach to optimize and improve
how we serve those at high risk for being missed by and/or falling off the HIV prevention cascade - people who
use drugs (PWUD) who also belong to other key HIV risk groups (transgender women, men who have sex with
men [MSM], Black/Latinx/Indigenous people). Specifically, the study will develop mSYNC, an mHealth
SYNdemic-based, C&L psychology HIV prevention intervention for the emergency department (ED).
Significance. Despite efficacious interventions for HIV, services are not reaching minoritized PWUD who
continue to have high incidence. Syndemic theory proposes that co-occurring, mutually reinforcing
psychosocial challenges (drug use, mental health, minority stress, unmet basic needs) drive HIV risk behavior
and create barriers to care access. Alternative prevention efforts are needed to address this holistic syndemic
HIV risk profile among minoritized PWUD and overcome historical barriers to reach. Due to low engagement in
regular clinic-based care, minoritized PWUD have high utilization of drop-in care via EDs. With long wait times,
ED visits are a prime opportunity to engage minoritized PWUD we are not reaching. Consultation-liaison (C&L)
psychology offers a compelling framework to deliver a syndemic-targeted HIV intervention in the ED. Yet, EDs
are overburdened with limited capacity to add services. mHealth could simulate human-delivered C&L with
improvements such as continued on demand access to intervention content (individual-level intervention) and
capacity build the ED to deliver integrated care for HIV prevention (hospital-level intervention). Guided by the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, development of mSYNC is grounded in
implementation science to address pragmatic barriers to uptake within complexities of EDs and lives of
minoritized PWUD. Objectives/Methods. To inform implementability and create a beta version of mSYNC, an
mHealth user-centered design model approach will be used (Aim 1). Aim 2 will pilot test mSYNC to assess
patient-level implementation outcomes of acceptability and appropriateness via a single-arm trial with N=100
minoritized PWUD in the ED. Secondarily, change over time will be explored for HIV risk, drug use, and mental
health symptoms, and linkage to care. Assessments are at baseline, post-initial app use, and 30-, 60-, and 90-
day via quantitative survey and exit interview. Aim 3 will evaluate hospital-level implementation outcomes of
relative advantage and compatibility via a cross-sectional survey with ED stakeholders (N=30).
Innovation/Impact. Aligned with NIH high priority areas, this study capitalizes on a unique merging of
disciplines to produce an innovative, real-world, low threshold approach to address HIV disparities among
those at highest risk for acquisition. The potential impact is development of a scalable tool that has trans-NIH
applicability to other high priority health issues disproportionately experienced by marginalized groups with
broader impact for health equity. Relevant to NOT-DA-20-037."

Harnessing Machine Learning & Object Detection for Automated Evaluation of Student-folded Protein Models
This project will impact public health through improved bioscience education. Mini-toobers are one of 3D Molecular
Designs’ (3DMD) most innovative, popular, and effective modeling tools. This free-form modeling material (foam-
covered wire) typically represents the backbone of a folded protein, allowing students to model actual protein
structures. The problem is that mini-toobers lack an immediate feedback system. As a free-form modeling tool,
students can use mini-toobers to model biological structures correctly just as easily as incorrectly (right vs. left-handed
helices). 3DMD’s other modeling tools have feedback features like magnets, arrows, post/hole connections, etc. that
help students self-correct. Educators observe student’s use of models to see their understanding of a concept; this
observation is a type of formative assessment. However, there is often too much to observe in a mini-toober model
(shape, sidechains, secondary structures, etc.) for an educator to assess all the data in real-time effectively.
Our solution is to apply machine learning and object detection to create digital applications that deliver immediate
feedback and precise assessment of student-folded mini-toober protein models. Two applications will be created:
1) Student Training App. The app's augmented reality features will give students immediate feedback on their modeling
of alpha helices, beta sheets, and other protein motifs to help them learn protein structure and function. 2) Assessment
App. This password-protected app will assess the model’s accuracy, generate a numerical score, and identify inaccurate
regions of the protein. This Phase I proposal focuses on two specific aims necessary to establish the feasibility of
achieving this goal:
 1. Develop AI technology to locate student-folded zinc finger protein models with an 80% average precision rating.
 2. Create a data gathering plan to collect the 3D coordinates of student-folded protein models.
We will focus our research and development efforts on feasibility testing machine learning frameworks, including
TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Unity Barracuda; on computer vision libraries such as OpenCV; and on object detection and
conversion systems, including YOLO and ONNX to achieve these specific aims. One of the most powerful aspects of
object detection is the ability to identify various shapes and forms. This particularly applies to 3DMD’s Mini-Toober
protein modeling materials, as they can be folded into various structures depending on how a student interacts with the
material. We will collect student-folded zinc finger models from outreach programs run by other 3DMD staff and
partnering organizations. To test different approaches, we will scan the model with the developed app while recording
video for documentation. The team will continue to develop and refine the application until at least an 80% average
precision rating is achieved. We will then create a data-collection plan to document enough models at Science
Olympiad competitions to build the asset library needed for the next phase of this project."

The overall goal of this NCI K08 career development proposal is to facilitate Dr. Ko Un Park’s development into
an independent investigator in cancer health services research focusing on implementation strategies that
promote evidence-based care in surgical oncology and improve outcomes for cancer patients. Specifically, this
proposal will apply insights from implementation science (IS) to the application of cancer surgery standards as
set forth by the Commission on Cancer (CoC). The CoC is an accreditation organization that seeks to improve
outcomes for individual patients with cancer through standardization of care delivery across 1500 hospitals
providing care to some 70% of Americans with cancer. To date, the CoC has not paired its standards with
implementation strategies; consequently, the standards’ implementation is often poor. The overarching goal of
this project is to create stakeholder-driven strategies for adopting the use of the CoC’s new breast synoptic
operative report (SOR) standard, by using tools from IS to identify and address barriers and facilitators to SOR
implementation in diverse healthcare systems. To achieve this, in Aim 1 we will conduct key stakeholder
interviews to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing breast SOR. In Aim 2, we will use evidence of
implementation determinants to design strategies that facilitate breast SOR implementation. We will test the
influence of the strategies on key implementation outcomes (e.g., feasibility, acceptability) in Aim 3. We
hypothesize that we will identify both surgeon- and organization-level drivers of SOR implementation that can
be leveraged to establish multi-level implementation strategies that will improve breast cancer outcomes. The
planned training, proposed research project, multidisciplinary mentorship team, and exceptional research
environment at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center are ideally suited to address Dr. Park’s
career goals. Her career development plan includes formal coursework in IS as well as directed readings and
conferences. This education and mentored effort to execute the research proposal aid Dr. Park’s long-term
career goal to become an independently funded implementation scientist-clinician to improve cancer patient
outcomes by facilitating the implementation of professional self-regulation polices (i.e., CoC standards) in diverse
health systems and cancer centers, and among physicians. With this training, Dr. Park will be able to successfully
obtain funding for a subsequent prospective, multicenter trial testing the effectiveness of the strategies developed
in the proposed project."
10913729,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel therapy for the treatment of burn wound infections caused
by the opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Paer), a leading cause of burn wound
infections.Paer colonizes 14 to 33% of burn wounds within 14 days after hospital admission. Paer infections
are difficult to treat due to intrinsic antibiotic resistance, its propensity to adopt the biofilm mode of growth within
burn wounds, and the prevalence of strains that are resistant to several antibiotics. In fact, Paer strains that are
resistant to all anti-pseudomonal antibiotics except the antibiotic of last resort, colistin, have been identified,
prompting the CDC to designate Paer as a “Serious Threat” pathogen. To address the need for innovative
therapies to treat Paer burn wound infections, we propose to evaluate a novel class of small molecules that
inhibit the type 3 secretion system (T3SS), the major virulence factor utilized by Paer to establish infections and
to disseminate in the host. In previous research, we have discovered and chemically optimized the
phenoxyacetamides (PhAs), a series of potent, small molecule inhibitors of the Paer T3SS. As the result of
extensive chemical optimization of this series, we have identified five distinct compounds that are potent
inhibitors of T3SS activity in vitro, are drug-like, and are efficacious as single agents against Paer in an
immunocompetent murine pneumonia model, decreasing bacterial load in the lungs by >1 log10 CFU, and
significantly decreasing dissemination to the liver by >1 log10 CFU. Our strategy for achieving the overall goal
of this proposal is to obtain proof-of-principle data demonstrating that the in vivo validated PhA T3SS inhibitors
are efficacious against Paer burn wound infections using in vitro and in vivo burn wound infection models.
Compounds that meet the milestones for in vivo efficacy will be developed further as novel therapy for burn
wound infections in a follow-on Phase II proposal. To achieve the goal of this proposal, we will complete the
following specific aims: Aim 1. Prioritize in vivo validated T3SS inhibitors using an in vitro burn wound model
(MBX, years 1 and 2); Aim 2. Evaluate 2 prioritized T3SS inhibitors in the murine thermal injury infection model
(MGH, years 1 and 2)."
10919591,"Project Abstract
In 2018 approximately 210,000 people in the U.S. underwent a craniotomy requiring cranial flap closure. The
instruments used to cut into the skull leave a continuous gap (“kerf line”) between the bone flap and the
surrounding skull. While cranial flap closure is relatively routine using plates and screws to fixate the flap, the
industry has lacked any real innovation to improve the status quo in patient care. Clinical results are still plagued
by many patients that spontaneously return with a loose or migrating plate, a devastating CSF leak or even
infection that often requires surgical intervention. Not to mention, plates and screws cause artifacts that interfere
with follow-up imaging (MRI or CT). Finally, plates and screws don't address the gaps left behind by the kerf line;
therefore, bone healing does not fully complete across this space. As a result, patients often complain of pain
and can feel the plates and screws through scalp and see depressions where the skin sinks—certainly this
effects their self-esteem. While flap fixation can be augmented with existing bone cements to address some of
these problems, they are not ubiquitously used because they lack desired handling properties and/or they
significantly increase the cost of the cranial closure.
RevBio’s bone adhesive biomaterial called Tetranite® (TN) could solve these issues. To accomplish this, the
bone adhesive material is injected into the kerf line, forming a robust fixation bond between the bone flap and
the surrounding skull and forming a water-tight seal upon setting. Overtime, the material serves as a scaffold as
it is gradually resorbed and replaced with bone. Thus, the material serves many functions as a fixation device, a
sealant, and a fusion device. Therefore, the goal for this project will be to advance the product from pre-clinical
development into humans and be the first truly efficacious option for replacing hardware (e.g., plates/screws,
clips) as a flap fixation methodology. The adhesive system has been fully developed, verified in a published
pivotal animal study, and validated in user handling cadaver trials; therefore, the next stage in the project
supported by the proposed grant application would accomplish the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Produce and
Test a Clinical-Grade Batch of TN for the Pilot Human Study, Aim 2A: Enroll Patients in Pilot Study and
Demonstrate Feasibility of Intra-operatively Fixating Flaps with TN as a Stand-Alone Device, and Aim 2B:
Patients Successfully Reach Primary and Secondary Endpoints at 6 and 12 Months Evidencing Safe Use
and Probable Benefit to Advance to a Larger or Expanded Clinical Study.
The proposed human pilot clinical study will demonstrate TN’s ability to fixate cranial flaps as a stand-alone and
replacement to hardware fixation for the first time in humans and will substantiate those flaps restored using TN
can withstand healing forces with desirable patient cometic outcomes while bone healing is occurring. This study
will provide early assessment prior to initiating a larger clinical study and will compare performance to standard
of care, i.e., plates and screws for cranial flap fixation."

The primary objective of this project is to develop therapeutic IgA to uniquely harness the tumor cytolytic potential
of neutrophils to target EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thereby enabling these patients to
live better, longer lives. Toward this goal, TigaTx is developing TIGA-001, a first-in-class, IgA-based monoclonal
antibody treatment for advanced/metastatic EGFR-positive NSCLC, with plans to initiate a first-in-human clinical
trial. TigaTx has generated a robust data package around the TIGA-001 molecule, leading to its selection as our
first development candidate. TIGA-001 has demonstrated excellent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy, and is
well tolerated in non-human primates with favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. TIGA-001 utilizes our
patented, structure-driven protein engineering to overcome the known manufacturing liabilities of natural IgA,
enabling us to be the first to transform IgA into a clinically-relevant platform technology. In this project, we will
progress our TIGA-001 candidate into CMC activities, in vitro pharmacology, and biomarker identification and
assay development to support filing of an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA. Supported CMC
activities will consist of vector generation through master cell bank establishment. Supported pharmacology
studies will focus on in vitro safety assessment and studies to support GLP toxicology species selection.
Biomarker assays developed from these studies will be incorporated into our first-in-human clinical trial to
evaluate dose-PD response relationships, enable patient selection/enrichment, and otherwise inform clinical
strategy. Because therapeutic IgA is a platform technology with potential to target a wide variety of tumor-
associated antigens, demonstrating clinical proof of concept with our TIGA-001 program would not only benefit
patients with EGFR-expressing tumors, but would also open the door to using this approach against other targets
in a wide range of additional clinical settings."
10923880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide.
There are significant racial disparities in HCC risk. Blacks, Hispanics and Asians all have increased risk of HCC
compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Also, Blacks consistently have the lowest survival after HCC diagnosis. Likely,
genetic variation and gene-environment interactions modify HCC risk and may also contribute to racial
differences in HCC survival. The objective of this proposal is to leverage our established cohort of diverse
patients with chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and HCC to identify how genetic variation, including genetic
ancestry, drives disparities in HCC risk and mortality, in the context of known risk factors and social determinants
of health. This career development award will provide Dr. Patricia Jones, a skilled hepatologist with experience
in clinical epidemiology, with the opportunity to gain additional training in genetic epidemiology, genetic analysis,
longitudinal data analysis and predictive modeling. Understanding how genetic ancestry drives HCC risk
and outcomes is the first step towards identifying specific ancestry-associated genes and pathways that
are linked to increased risk and/or poor survival. In Aim 1, we will define the relationship between genetic
ancestry and HCC risk by genotyping 200 participants with HCC, 400 participants with chronic liver disease ±
cirrhosis and 400 healthy controls from the NIH All of Us study. We will define how HCC risk differs based on
genetic ancestry across the genome (global) and at specific chromosomal locations for commonly mutated genes
in HCC, e.g. TERT, ARID1A, RB, CTNNB1, TP53, PNPLA3, and IDH1/2. We will also explore new genetic
targets as they emerge from ongoing genetic studies. We will build and validate an HCC risk-prediction model
that incorporates genetic ancestry. By integrating genetic and clinical data with individual social factors and social
determinants of health, the proposed project will improve our ability to accurately predict HCC risk. By
distinguishing patients at highest risk, our risk stratification tool could transform the current HCC screening
paradigm. In Aim 2, we will use genotype data from 200 participants with HCC to develop a survival prediction
model that incorporates genetic ancestry, social determinants and clinical data. We will validate the final survival
model in two separate cohorts of HCC patients. The knowledge gained from our comprehensive survival analysis
in Aim 2 will improve our understanding of the genetic determinants of survival disparities and could lead to more
precise estimates of prognosis, a key patient-centered outcome. The formal and experiential training received
through coursework, internships and workshops will enable Dr. Jones to develop an ancestry-informed HCC risk
prediction model that will form the basis of a future R01 application. With guidance from a strong multidisciplinary
mentoring team with expertise in tumor biology, hepatobiliary malignancies, genetic epidemiology and social
determinants, Dr. Jones will develop new and complementary skills enabling her to become an independent
investigator who conducts integrative patient-oriented research that bridges the community, clinic and laboratory."

The proposed hybrid type 1 Effectiveness and Implementation randomized controlled trial (RCT) will
evaluate an m-Health syndemic intervention (WINGS+PrEP) that aims to increase HIV pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation and adherence among women in community supervision programs (CSPs)
including probation, parole and alternative-to-incarceration (ATI) programs) in New York City (NYC) who
report hazardous drinking. To date, very few PrEP interventions, have focused on cis-gender women, and
none have targeted the large population of women in CSPs, who due to racialized drug laws, are
disproportionately Black and Latinx. Advancing an effective PrEP intervention for women in CSPs holds
promise for reducing HIV disparities by reaching a disproportionately large number of Black and Latinx
women who remain at high risk for HIV. PrEP presents a unique opportunity for women to engage in a
female-controlled HIV prevention strategy, which is vitally important within the context of hazardous drinking
and violent partners. To date, however, there are no evidence-based syndemic-focused PrEP interventions
for women that address hazardous drinking and IPV exposure. The proposed study intervention
(WING+PrEP) is a 3-session syndemic focused intervention that combines an evidence-based mHealth
Alcohol Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) tool, and an evidence-based
mHealth IPV SBIRT tool - WINGS with an evidence-based PrEP intervention that includes a PrEP decision
making aid with novel peer navigation and telemedicine components. The proposed RCT will be conducted
with 300 women in CSPs Eligible women will be randomly assigned to: (1) WINGS+PrEP or (2) PrEP Alone
that consists of the same evidence-based PrEP decision making aid single session with peer navigation.
Both conditions will be delivered by Fortune Society a large community based organization that serves
women in CSPs. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post intervention.
This study will be guided by the PRISM/RE-AIM(S) implementation science framework with a health equity
lens and will examine how multilevel contextual factors may influence the reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, maintenance and sustainability (RE-AIMS) of WINGS+PrEP and PrEP and how these
contextual factors and processes may interact to promote or impede health equity. If WINGS+PrEP is found
to be effective, it's low threshold format is designed to be scaled up in CSP settings nationwide to curb HIV
infection and to reduce HIV disparities among women from heavily impacted communities."
10923882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Comparative functional genomics offers a powerful framework to study the molecular underpinnings of species-
specific traits. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) which control precise context-specific expression patterns of
genes play a significant role in diversifying phenotypes across species. These networks are central to cell type
specific function and are often disrupted in many diseases. However, comparison of gene regulatory networks
across species has been challenging because of the lack of sufficient number of samples across matched
biological contexts. Single cell omic technologies, such as single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq
(scATAC-seq), are revolutionizing biology enabling researchers to profile the activity of nearly all genomic
regions in each individual cell. Single cell omic studies are quickly expanding to multiple species providing
unprecedented opportunities to define cell types and their underlying gene regulatory networks and study their
evolution. However, computational methods for defining cell-types and cell-specific GRNs across species are
in their infancy. In particular, samples in a multi-species scRNA-seq dataset are related by a phylogeny, however,
existing integration approaches do not model these relationships. Furthermore, existing approaches are
restricted to one-to-one relationships across species, which makes it difficult to study some of the major sources
of evolutionary innovation (e.g., duplications) in cell type identity. In this project, we will develop novel
computational methods to tackle two problems: (a) defining cell types and their lineage relationships across
species from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, (b) inference and comparative analysis of cell type-specific
GRNs across species from single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Our tools will be based on machine learning
methods, namely, probabilistic graphical models, multi-task and multi-view learning, and matrix factorization, that
offer principled frameworks to integrate information across species. We will first test these tools in human and
mouse scRNA-seq/ATAC-seq datasets from our collaborators and published studies. We will demonstrate the
full potential of our tools on a novel multi-species kidney scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq dataset that we will collect to
study normal kidney function as well as compensatory renal growth, which controls how one kidney recovers
after surgical removal of another kidney. We will identify conserved and diverged regulatory networks that will
be used to prioritize sequence and protein regulators for validation studies with CRISPR and siRNA. Our analysis
will reveal key insights into how GRNs evolve across species and how they establish different cell types. Our
approaches and novel datasets will provide critical insight into the molecular programs governing kidney
structure and function that could have a significant clinical impact for patients with kidney disease. Our methods
will constitute a suite of broadly applicable tools that can shed insight into principles of gene regulation and cell
fate specification that will be applicable to single cell datasets from diverse multi-cellular systems."
10923885,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Quantitative PET Imaging of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Clinical decisions regarding the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely guided
by conventional, anatomical imaging modalities. These methods, namely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and x-ray computed tomography (CT), provide little information about the cellular and molecular underpinnings
of individual tumors. HCC is the most common primary tumor of the liver and represents a major healthcare
challenge in the United States (US) and elsewhere. The American Cancer Society estimates diagnosis of greater
than 42,000 new cases of liver cancer in the US this year. In contrast to cancers more frequently diagnosed in
the US and for which precision cancer medicine is routinely employed, such as colon or breast, incidence of liver
cancer and liver cancer-associated deaths are both increasing. Improved tools to detect HCC at early, potentially
curable stages, and tools to predict future tumor behavior are urgently needed. Molecular imaging with positron
emission tomography (PET) is uniquely poised to provide those tools, yet novel tracers are required. The
sensitivity of routine 18F-FDG PET, the most commonly utilized approach in clinical oncology, is limited in HCC,
and other tracers that exhibit greater potential, such as 11C-acetate, suffer technical limitations that prevent their
broad clinical use. The overarching goal of this application is to clinically evaluate an innovative PET imaging
tracer that has the potential to personalize decision making in the care of patients with HCC. We propose to
conduct the first quantitative imaging clinical trial of (S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (18F-FSPG) PET
in the setting of HCC. As an emerging PET tracer reflecting tumor glutamate transport, 18F-FSPG PET has shown
clinical safety and efficacy in multiple tumor settings, including breast, lung, and brain cancer. Our preliminary
data in a pilot cohort of Vanderbilt patients, as well as a pilot clinical study conducted in Asia (n = 5), suggest the
feasibility of using 18F-FSPG PET to improve the detection of HCCs even among cirrhosis, a comorbidity that
diminishes the effectiveness of conventional imaging approaches. Our study has three Specific Aims. In patients
undergoing surgery for treatment of HCC, we will (1) evaluate the relationship between 18F-FSPG PET, pathology
and cancer metabolism; (2) compare 18F-FSPG PET with standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostic imaging in patients
with HCC and benign liver lesions; and (3) compare uptake of 18F-FSPG with 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG in HCC
and background liver. This study has the potential to establish a new role for non-invasive molecular imaging in
the delivery of individualized cancer care for patients with HCC."

 To enable SPORE investigators to rapidly develop new research opportunities which could translate into
early benefits for breast cancer patients, and to allow for exploration of new techniques which may require
substantial efforts but which are nevertheless not ready for full scale multi-year research funding, we have
devoted considerable effort and resources to this SPORE Developmental Research Program. The Executive
Committee, together with the advocate members and the Internal Advisory Board, selects proposals for funding
as Developmental Projects, based on their scientific merit and relevance to SPORE translational goals.
 Through the funding of pilot projects, we broaden the scope of research, and allow exploration of high-risk
ideas that have the potential for high yields in treatment, prevention, or basic biology of breast cancer. We also
attract new investigators with a wide variety of special expertise to apply their expertise to problems and
questions in breast cancer research, and we catalyze productive collaborations in which individual skills and
approaches combine to create progress that no single investigator could achieve alone. It is important to point
out that, although only $50,000 per year is requested from SPORE funds for this program, and Baylor College
of Medicine is contributing an additional $50,000 per year in recognition of the value of this outreach effort to
cancer research at Baylor.
 During the 26 years of funding since our first Breast SPORE award in 1992, we funded 106 developmental
projects, contributing to 128 publications and providing essential preliminary data for 85 successful grant
applications with several still pending. Two of the new full projects in this application derived in part from
developmental projects to Drs. Chang and Westbrook. This mechanism complements the larger and longer-
term regular research projects, offering a degree of flexibility which leads to enhanced productivity for the SPORE
as a whole."

dampening of the DNA damage response. Our findings have led to novel hypotheses and testing them will
deepen our understanding of critical genome regulation strategies.
 DNA replication must cope with many types of template barriers. The coping mechanisms entail close
collaboration between the replisome and many regulators. One of our long-term goals is to elucidate how
various regulators dynamically modify replisome functions. We will apply novel strategies to identify replisome

 When replication forks stalled by barriers fail to recover, collapsed forks and unreplicated DNA gaps can be
repaired by homologous recombination, generating repair intermediates such as Holliday junctions. Resolving
such joint DNA structures by specialized cleavage enzymes completes the repair process and prevents DNA

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by rapid onset of
chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. Recent advances in immunotherapy have changed
the standard of care for SCLC for the first time in over 30 years. Dr. Allison Stewart (Resarch
Specialist) and Dr. Lauren Byers (Unit Director) in the Department of Thoracic Head and Neck
Medical Oncology at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center aim to address major,
unmet needs in SCLC, including development of novel therapeutic targets, investigation of
approaches to enhance response to immunotherapy, and the study of heterogeneity and its
contribution to drug resistance. Mechanisms underlying treatment-resistance remain obscure due
to scarcity of tissue samples from relapsed patients. To address this deficiency, Dr. Stewart has
led efforts to establish novel SCLC models and analyze serial blood and tumor biopsies from
patients using innovative genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays to study mechanisms
driving treatment resistance to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapies in SCLC.
Patient liquid biopsies are non-invasive, facilitate both serial and post-relapse tissue sampling
and contain sufficient circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for generation of CTC-derived xenograft
(CDX) models of SCLC, as well as for direct single-cell transcriptional profiling. CDXs mirror
patient disease by expression of SCLC markers, sites of metastatic disease and platinum
response. Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) of SCLC and its contribution to clinical outcomes has
not been fully characterized. To investigate ITH, single-cell analyses (including single-cell
RNAseq) were performed on novel platinum-sensitive and -resistant SCLC CDX models, as well
as longitudinal analyses of CDX models and patient CTCs over the course of therapy. Dr. Stewart
has demonstrated that refractory SCLC is characterized by increased heterogeneity and the
development of multiple, disparate resistant cell populations within the same patient. In order to
address the scarcity of SCLC tissue samples, especially paired and post-relapse samples, Dr.
Byers has spearheaded an effort to integrate serial tissue acquisition into the design of all SCLC-
focused clinical trials at MDACC. Dr. Stewart's goal is to coordinate a SCLC platform by working
with multi-disciplinary teams, including a clinical team (identify and consent patients), a laboratory
processing team (process/bank specimens, as well as generate animal models), an experimental
analysis team (perform experiments with CTCs, tumor specimens and animal models) and a
bioinformatics team (scientific analysis) to establish a repository of SCLC specimens for
understanding treatment resistance and developing methods to recognize patient response."
10928728,"Recent evidence indicates that the presence of conventional dendritic cells type 1 (cDC1) in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) is required for response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. In addition to cross-
presenting cancer cell-derived antigens to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, cDC1 promote tumor infiltration by effector T cells,
and support their survival and function. Thus, interventions that improve cDC1 recruitment to the TME could enhance
patient responses to ICB. Focal radiation therapy (RT) increases responses to ICB therapy, at least in part by inducing
type I interferon (IFN-I) and driving cDC1 into the irradiated tumor. We have previously shown that cDC1 are essential
for immune-mediated regression of irradiated and synchronous non-irradiated tumors (abscopal effect) in mice treated
with RT and ICB. Abscopal responses have also been achieved in metastatic cancer patients treated with RT and ICB, but
less reliably than expected, and the determinants of such responses remain unclear. We hypothesize that a previously
unexplored barrier to abscopal responses is the limited infiltration of poorly immunogenic tumors by cDC1, which
precludes effector T cells generated at the irradiated tumor site from rejecting non-irradiated tumors. Moreover, we
hypothesize that activation of a strong IFN-I response in the irradiated tumor is essential for achieving systemic
activation of natural killer (NK) cells, which can home to non-irradiated tumors and foster the recruitment of cDC1. This
hypothesis is supported by a strong scientific premise which is based on the recent literature and on our extensive
published and unpublished data, including the fact that increased serum IFNb post-RT was the top predictor for abscopal
responses in metastatic lung cancer patients treated with RT+anti-CTLA4 (Nat Med 2018). To test this hypothesis three
independent but related aims that address different mechanistic questions are planned. Aim 1 will investigate the role
of RNA:DNA hybrids, which accumulate in the cytosol of irradiated cancer cells and in the cargo of small extracellular
vesicles (sEV) they produce, in activating the IFN-I pathway via cGAS/STING in cancer cells and locoregional DCs. The role
of RT-induced IFNb in systemic NK cell activation will be confirmed by using IFNAR1-deficient NK cells. Aim 2 will
determine the contribution of sEV to RT-induced IFN-I activation in vivo by using Rab27a-deficient cancer cells. Aim 3 will
directly address the role of NK cells in driving cDC1 infiltration in abscopal tumors and abscopal responses to RT+ICB. In
addition, NK cell functional subsets present in the blood of lung cancer patients with abscopal response to RT+anti-
CTLA4 will be investigated by single cell analysis. Results of proposed studies will identify a novel mechanism whereby
local IFN-I induction by RT activates a systemic cross-talk between NK cells and cDC1, required for T-cell mediated
rejection of abscopal tumors."
10928248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Collective cell migration is the most prevalent form of cell migration in the body; it is involved in the construction
and repair of almost all human tissues. Previous work by the PIs has provided novel insight on the hierarchy of
individual cell behaviors and intracellular signals that drive collective migration. This work identified activation of
the intracellular signal PLCg1 as strongly correlated with increased collective migration and cell migration
persistence. The proposed study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which PLCg1 drives collective migration
and will yield both novel tools and knowledge that may be applied to control this process. We will achieve this
goal by:
 1) Determining the mechanism(s) by which PLCg1 activation yields cytoskeletal remodeling. We will develop
 a FRET-based PLCg1 reporter and identify the downstream effectors of PLCg1 that drive cytoskeletal
 rearrangement, a critical component of cell movement.
 2) Elucidating the biophysical mechanisms by which PLCg1 activation translates into directed collective
 migration. We will develop cellular models with varying levels of constitutively active PLCg1 and apply
 traction force microscopy to analyze how cytoskeletal forces are transmitted to yield collective cell
movement.
 3) Determining optimal patterns and extent of PLCg1 activation needed for robust collective migration. We
 will develop an optogenetic approach to stimulate different spatio-temporal dynamics of PLCg1 activation
 during directed keratinocyte migration.
By employing a combination of innovative molecular and biophysical tools, we aim to uncover mechanistic
knowledge that allows us to gain control over collective epithelial migration. Identifying the pathway(s) by which
PLCg1 activation connects to downstream signals, as well as its spatial and temporal dynamics within the
collective sheet, provides opportunities to regulate both healthy and pathological collective migration across a
range of tissues and pathologies. Elucidation of these pathways and cues provides an important foundation for
targeting specific elements to induce collective movement in conditions where it is impaired (e.g., chronic would
healing) or to halt collective movement in conditions where it is pathological (e.g., cancer)."
10928250,"Abstract
Accurate replication of the genome during cell proliferation is necessary for normal animal development and
homeostasis. Disruption of the regulation or fidelity of replication contributes to many human pathologies,
particularly cancer. Thus, a complete understanding of the mechanisms governing genome replication is
paramount to human health. Replication of large genomes like that found in human cells requires the initiation
of bi-directional DNA synthesis at thousands of individual locations on each chromosome. It also requires cell
cycle-regulated synthesis of large amounts of histone proteins to package newly replicated DNA into
chromatin. This project will focus on how chromatin assembly and organization influences genome replication
during animal development. The basic building block of chromatin is the nucleosome, an octamer of histone
proteins encompassed by ~147 base pairs of DNA. Most histone proteins within chromatin are synthesized
each S phase of the cell cycle from replication-dependent histone genes, which encode the only eukaryotic
mRNAs that end in a stem loop rather than a poly A tail. The genes encoding all five RD-histone proteins are
clustered in metazoan genomes, and transcription and pre-mRNA processing factors required for histone
mRNA biosynthesis are organized into a nuclear body (the Histone Locus Body or HLB) that assembles at
these gene clusters. We will determine the requirements for the coordinate synthesis of the RD-histone
mRNAs using both biochemical and genetic approaches in Drosophila, with a particular focus on the role that
the HLB plays in histone transcription and pre-mRNA processing. Each core histone protein has an N-terminal
tail that protrudes from the nucleosome core and is subject to a variety of chemical modifications (e.g.
methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation) that modulate chromatin organization and thus influence all
aspects of genome function, including DNA replication. We have developed a method in Drosophila for
engineering any desired histone tail mutation, providing us a means of preventing modification of specific
histone residues and thus of manipulating chromatin organization in a way not available in any other animal.
This genetic approach will be combined with cell biological and next generation DNA sequencing methods to
determine how chromatin organization modulates DNA replication throughout the entire genome, thereby
addressing a major question in the field. Our Drosophila experimental paradigm permits the in vivo
interrogation of these fundamental processes in gene expression and DNA replication in ways that are
unavailable in other experimental systems."
10928256,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clinical genetic testing, including exome sequencing, has diagnosed many rare and novel genetic disorders.
These diagnoses have helped guide treatment, suggest novel or precision therapies, and provide long-term
prognostic information for individuals and their families. However, at least 50% of individuals with a suspected
genetic disorder remain undiagnosed after a complete clinical evaluation, which can take years to complete.
There are two major technical reasons for this low solve rate. First, structural variants such as large deletions,
insertions, inversions, and repeat expansions account for a significant fraction of unsolved cases, but they are
challenging to analyze using traditional short-read sequencing technologies. Second, many variants lie in
recently duplicated genomic regions that are difficult to evaluate using short-read sequencing technologies.
Recently, it has become economically feasible to pursue whole-genome long-read sequencing (LRS) of human
genomes with sufficient coverage to analyze these complex genomic regions. This presents an opportunity to
systematically evaluate the incremental diagnostic rate of LRS over current testing approaches and apply LRS
technology to a large cohort of individuals with unsolved genetic disorders. Moreover, LRS is unique in that as a
single test it has the potential to replace nearly all existing clinical genetic testing (microarray, exome, methylation
studies), making it possible to perform a complete clinical genetic evaluation in days to weeks using a single
dataset. The overall goal of this project is to establish a framework for the clinical adoption of long-read DNA and
RNA sequencing by systematic evaluation of individuals with suspected or unsolved genetic disorders. To
achieve this goal, LRS will be performed on 50 critically ill neonates and their parents who had nondiagnostic
trio short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and 25 trios from the same cohort who had diagnostic WGS
(Aim 1). This will help establish the incremental diagnostic rate of LRS over short-read WGS. To evaluate the
technical advantages of LRS over traditional clinical testing, I will sequence 50 individuals with a suspected
genetic disorder who remain unsolved after at least clinical exome sequencing (Aim 2). In up to 20 persons that
remain undiagnosed after LRS, long-read RNA sequencing will be used to identify high-priority regions that
influence gene expression or splicing for further analysis. I will then evaluate the sensitivity of LRS as a single
genetic test by sequencing 50 individuals undergoing a typical outpatient clinical evaluation (Aim 3).
Demonstrating that LRS can be used as a single data source will help streamline the current stepwise approach
to clinical testing, leading to an increase in the diagnostic rate and an overall cost savings to the health system
through reduced testing and clinic visits. Overall, the aims outlined in this proposal will benefit patients and
families by increasing the rate of genetic diagnosis, decreasing the time to diagnosis, and identifying novel
disease-causing mechanisms, which will lead to a better understanding of the causes of human disease."
10928110,"Project Summary/Abstract
In biomedical research, the need for a diverse pool of researchers in statistics and data science has never
been greater. Yet, the requisite academic pipeline for training such a workforce remains inadequate. Minority
students admitted to statistics or biostatistics graduate programs are confronted with lack of diversity at the
faculty level, and, frequently, lack of awareness by faculty of ways to best support them.
Explanations for the lack of faculty diversity in science are multifactorial, but two key drivers are the lack of
inclusion frequently felt by racial and ethnic minority students, and the pipeline problem reflected by the low
number of doctoral graduates from these historically marginalized groups. The driving objective of
SeattleStatSummer (SeattleStatSummer for Biomedical Data Science Research Training) is to simultaneously
tackle these obstacles. To address the pipeline problem, we will develop and implement a new summer
mentored research program for undergraduates who identify as underrepresented minorities. The program will
offer: (1) an engaging and supportive mentored research experience that increases their awareness of and
interest in pursuing careers in statistics and data science research and (2) career development, community
building, and social/emotional support activities. Our goal is that students will not only gain skills and
confidence in statistics and data science, but they will feel a sense of belonging and rightful place in the
statistics and research communities. The program will also provide coaching to faculty mentors to optimize
their chances of success and confidence in mentoring students and will engage faculty in activities that build
community.
The specific objectives of SeattleStatSummer are: (1) Educate: through intensive training in R programming
and statistics via an introductory didactic program followed by ongoing reinforcement and support; (2) Engage:
via carefully crafted mentored statistics projects; (3) Enable: through career development workshops and a
role-model program; (4) Endure: foster ongoing connection and support students in pursuing research careers
in the field via activities to build community and sense of belonging and career support post program. In
addition, we propose to offer a program for faculty mentors that will improve mentoring skills, build confidence
in supervising students from historically marginalized groups, and increase awareness of the importance of
fostering a sense of belonging and rightful presence for these students.
The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center offers a world-renowned research environment and scientific faculty,
prioritizes training the next generation of biomedical researchers, and is strongly committed to diversity, equity,
and inclusion. The Puget Sound area is home to a large immigrant community and a diverse set of minority
cultures, which will be targeted for recruitment via a well-honed diversity recruitment plan bolstered by
longstanding community partnerships."

the US. The Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCaTS) was created to be an engine
of translational science and innovations, envisioning to enable high-quality multidisciplinary research to
accelerate clinical trials, facilitate digital health transformation, and partner with stakeholders and communities
to improve patient care and health for all. The CCaTS was awarded a UL-1 grant (UL1TR002377-07) with the
following specific aims: simplify and accelerate the work of translation to improve health for all by advancing
clinical trial innovations and digital health transformations, streamlining methods and processes, and developing
novel informatics solutions that increase efficiency and drive implementation of discoveries that improve health
and promote health equity (Aim 1); enhance education programs through the expanded reach of competency-
based, learner-focused solutions, training a diverse, inclusive, multidisciplinary CTS workforce to be prepared to
address the urgent health care needs of all communities in a rapidly changing environment (Aim 2); engage
local community members and patients to be active partners in translational teams, expanding research
capabilities of underserved communities (Aim 3); expand national and regional partnerships and strengthen
collaborative CTS networks in all aspects of CTS and education, focusing on sharing innovative approaches and
prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (Aim 4).
 Diversity supplement summary: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing burden in public health
and has a significant genetic component that remains largely under investigated. Prior studies have identified
genes associated with CKD, but their effects are relatively small, and a large proportion of the remaining genetic
risk is expected to be related to rare gene variants yet to be investigated. In addition, the penetrance of
pathogenic variants (percentage of a clinical trait in carriers of pathogenic genetic variants) is not well
determined, limiting out ability to interpret the significance of a positive finding. Investigations into new genes
and on penetrance of CKD-associated genes are an unmet need to promote individualized medicine, expected
to accelerate innovations in care by allowing the identification of people at risk, mechanisms of disease, and
potential new targets for treatment and prevention. New genomic and digital resources are now available
enabling us to fulfil this gap in knowledge. By specifically aligning with the Parent Aim 1 (facilitation of digital
health transformation) and Parent Aim 2 (preparation of a diverse workforce), this Diversity Supplement intends
to:
 Aim 1. To investigate rare genetic variants associated to CKD using meta-analysis of burden tests
for rare variants from four large repositories with genomic data. I will do meta-analysis of the association
of rare variants (MAF<10-3) and various CKD phenotypes in the UK-Biobank, All of Us Study, Mayo Clinic
Tapestry Study, and Mayo Biobank Study. Phenotypes tested will be estimated glomerular filtration rate, all-
cause and specific causes of CKD, end-stage kidney disease, albuminuria, and renal cysts. I will generate
computational algorithms to perform data extraction and harmonization of variables between studies, creating
an integrated system able to facilitate similar analysis. In addition, computational algorithms linking selected
variants to a set of secondary data sources will be developed to generate a map of associations to other related
phenotypes and potential therapeutic targets for drug development or repurposing.
 Aim 2. To define the penetrance of pathogenic genetic variants for renal phenotypes in a panel of
CKD-related genes using four large repositories with genomic data. I will first identify pathogenic or likely-
pathogenic variants related to CKD, including those from Aim 1. For each gene, observed penetrance in UK-
Biobank, All of Us Study, Mayo Clinic Tapestry Study, and Mayo-Biobank Study will be computed. For the genes
with sample size amenable to investigation, modulators of penetrance will be investigated by comparing within
the group harboring pathogenic variants those with or without the phenotype of interest."

Black Emerging Adults (BEA), ages 18-24, in the U.S. experience higher levels of poverty, illness, and
discrimination than White youth. These exposures to harm, coupled with the lack of supportive services to
address and mitigate poverty and structural inequities, result in health inequities. BEA experience high mental
health service needs, but much less service utilization than White youth, have higher rates of STI and less
access to family planning. Disrupting the social determinants of poverty that systematically affects BEA, can
have a transformative impact on a healthy transition into adulthood during a critical time in their development.
Guaranteed basic income (GBI) is an economic strategy that could redress financial inequities and transform
the mental and physical health outcomes of BEA, which has shown tremendous promise in adults populations
and youth in families receiving income, but little is known about how GBI program would work when cash is
transferred unconditionally and directly to Black emerging adults and what critical supports would be needed to
ensure GBI is most effective. We propose a randomized controlled crossover trial in which 300 low-income
BEA are allocated to receive a $500/month GBI either during the first twelve months of follow-up (phase I) or to
receive GBI in the second 12 months of a total of 24 months follow-up (phase II). All participants, regardless of
randomization arm, will be offered enrollment in financial capability programs -- peer learning circles and
financial coaching -- to bolster GBI effectiveness. Participants will also receive a cell phone-based real-time
monitoring and response intervention (RTMR), which will ensure that BEA with unmet health service needs
receive referrals. The RTMR system will simultaneously provide critical, time-sensitive information for
community agencies and policy makers to address documented service gaps. All components will be co-
designed and monitored by our Community Working Group, comprised of representatives from an extensive
network of partnering community agencies, city officials, and youth who have been active in the financial
capability space. Together these intervention components support BEA on the individual-level (GBI, coaching,
RTMR), interpersonal-level (peer learning circles), community-level (GBI & RTMR), and at the societal level
(policy impacts of GBI, RTMR). We will determine the impacts of GBI and GBI+multi-level supports on BEA’s
investment in their future (education, employment training), mental health (depressive symptoms and anxiety),
and unmet mental health and sexual/reproductive health service needs. We will also include a nested
qualitative component to explore mechanisms of impact on financial, mental and physical health. This study
leverages a strong multi-disciplinary community and research partnership; multilevel intervention components
that address the most urgent inequities that impact the trajectory of BEA during their transition to adulthood
and independence; and provides urgent experimental data with findings that could inform service provision and
policy to advance health equity."

10928807,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
For women in the United States, breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause
of death. In this application, we focus upon a specific subtype of breast cancer known as triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC). Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is considered more aggressive and extremely
difficult to treat with standard therapies. As a result, it has a high recurrence rate and a high overall mortality rate.
TNBC accounts for up to 20% of all breast cancers, with a higher incidence in ethnic minority populations and
young women (usually <40 years of age). Approximately 70% of patients with advanced TNBC die of disease
recurrence and/or metastasis within 5 years of initial diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the medical
community to develop more effective therapeutic options for this deadly disease.
In this project, we will investigate a novel experimental compound, named LG007, for its anti-cancer activity in
TNBC. Of significance, we will utilize robust TNBC Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) mouse models to study the
in vivo efficacy of LG007. Our preliminary results demonstrated that LG007 effectively inhibits TNBC tumor
growth and metastasis. Notably, we found that LG007 treatment could robustly shrink large human-derived
TNBC PDX tumors, with a near-complete response. These preliminary results strongly support the premise that
LG007 is a novel and potent drug candidate capable of treating progressive TNBC and associated metastasis.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that LG007 is able to target and regulate miR-10b, a well-known oncogenic
miRNA that promotes tumor development and metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-10b is a primary
target of LG007 that is critically involved in the molecular mechanisms of action by which LG007 inhibits tumor
growth and metastasis. Three specific aims are proposed in pursuit of the project’s objective to develop a new
therapy for the treatment of TNBC. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic roles of miR-10b and one of its
targets, NR4A3, in the anti-TNBC activity of LG007. In Aim 2, we will investigate the in vivo efficacy of LG007
utilizing a variety of advanced mouse models that mimic the clinical setting of TNBC and its associated
recurrence and metastasis. In Aim 3, we will characterize the pharmacological and toxicological properties of
LG007 in preparation for future translation to clinical testing. We expect that the results obtained from this study
will lead to the development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment for patients with advanced TNBC."
10928817,"Abstract
Internalizing symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms, suicidality) are alarmingly common among
adolescents. In 2019, nearly 37% of high school students reported feeling anxious, sad, or hopeless,
representing an increase from 2017 (i.e., 31%), and nearly 19% seriously considered suicide1, an increase
from 2017 (17%). The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated this problem, with research finding that social
isolation resulting from the pandemic was linked to higher levels of stress, fear, loneliness, anxiety, depression,
and suicide ideation among adolescents2-3. Importantly, ethnic/racial disparities have been documented in
internalizing symptoms, with more negative outcomes for Latinas and Black males39-45. Current universal
school-based approaches to prevention have reported uneven or limited effects, or no effects at all6-12.
Questions have also been raised regarding cost and accessibility49-59. Despite the uneven track record of
universal school-based (Tier 1) approaches, which has led some to recommend an emphasis on targeted (Tier
2) approaches48, they possess several advantages. First, given the demographic heterogeneity in risk factors,
as well as disparate access to high-quality, culturally-sensitive health care23, schools remain attractive as they
can ensure equitable access to primary prevention services. Second, universal programs avoid the difficulty of
identifying adolescents at risk12, and third, they minimize the risk of stigmatizing adolescents who seek out or
are referred to services20-22. In this project, submitted to the Transformative Research Award initiative (RFA-
RM-21-017), we will use cooperative learning (CL) as a universal (Tier 1) school-based prevention program to
target malleable peer-based risk factors and subsequently evaluate how change in these mechanisms can
reduce adolescent internalizing symptoms. CL targets various forms of maladaptive peer relations that create
stress and comprise a significant risk factor for internalizing symptoms in adolescence; CL also promotes peer
protective factors that can reduce the likelihood of internalizing symptoms (e.g., peer acceptance)27-34. CL has
also been found to promote more cross-race interaction and interracial attraction, greater cross-ethnic
academic support, and more frequent cross-ethnic friendships95-97. To support teachers in implementing CL,
we will use a Web-based software platform that provides an accessible, high-fidelity mechanism to deliver CL
lessons. We will not only test for intervention effects, but will also evaluate the relative strength of specific,
theoretically-derived change mechanisms, and uncover key issues/barriers related to implementation that will
allow us to dynamically adjust our implementation approach to achieve maximum impact during subsequent
scale-up. Our project is designed to establish feasibility with teachers and schools and counter potential threats
to implementation fidelity while also creating a roadmap to enhanced scalability and sustained implementation.
Significant results from this project could inspire broad uptake of our approach in educational contexts,
potentially addressing a significant public health need during a time of crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
10928821,"Internet-based TRAC (i-TRAC): Interactive Emotion Regulation Skills Training to Improve Adolescent
 Sexual Health
Adolescence is a critical developmental period during which behavioral patterns are formed that have powerful
influences on current and future health. This is particularly true for sexual behavior, which is affected by the
biological changes of puberty as well as normative developmental tasks around sexual exploration. Engaging
in sexual behavior in early adolescence (before age 15) is associated with more partners, less condom use,
and more frequent sex as teens get older, and these factors increase risk for negative health outcomes (e.g.,
sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy) throughout their lives. Many sexual health interven-
tions teach prevention skills, such as assertiveness or condom use; the premise of the current application is
that these skills are often unused by adolescents because of deficits in emotion regulation (ER), which is un-
addressed in most sexual health education. Our research team has developed and tested a novel, engaging,
efficacious, and developmentally tailored group intervention (Project TRAC) to teach ER skills to early adoles-
cents within the context of sexual health. A study of Project TRAC showed that participants taught ER skills
were less likely to start having sex over the 2.5 year follow up. While efficacious, the small group format of the
program presents barriers to sustainability and dissemination; significant advantages of web-based delivery
exist. To explore whether the ER concepts of TRAC could be taught in a web-based format, we completed a
pilot study to translate TRAC's ER content to a web-based intervention (iTRAC), using Designing for Dissemi-
nation principles that enhance the likelihood of successful dissemination upon completion. iTRAC demonstrat-
ed feasibility and acceptability, and a randomized trial showed that iTRAC participants reported significantly
better emotional competence compared to waitlist control participants. The proposed Fast Track project will
complete the technology adaptation of the program to include its sexual health content and content linking ER
to sexual health. This adaptation (iTRAC for Sexual Risk Prevention; iTRAC-SRP), using well-established the-
oretical frameworks, will be approached with advisory boards of school professionals and early adolescents,
leading to prototypes of the completed intervention in Phase 1. Phase 2 will include the creation of the remain-
ing digital intervention, an acceptability trial, and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 120 early adolescents
(12-14 years) comparing iTRAC-SRP to a waitlist control. This project represents innovation in adolescent
sexual health; its implementation has great potential for sustainability and accessibility."
10916997,"Validating SER-014, a TRPV1 antagonist, to treat endometriosis
Summary
 Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects ~10% of women and often results in debilitating
pain. The disease is characterized by lesions consisting of endometrium-like tissue infiltrated with inflammatory
cells, nerves, etc. In addition to local pain and irritation, lesions often lead to peripheral sensitization, including
TRPV1 upregulation. The disease is most commonly treated with NSAIDs, with hormonal manipulation (steroid
hormones and GNRH receptor modulators), and with surgery to remove lesions. Approximately 30% of patients
are not effectively treated by any of these options and endometriosis-associated pain is an important driver of
opioid use in women. There are no guidelines for the use of opioids in gynecologic pain, and endometriosis
patients can find themselves dependent upon opioids without substantial symptom relief. Endometriosis
increases the likelihood of chronic opioid use, opioid dependence/abuse, and opioid overdose.
 Serentrix LLC is a biotech company invested in the development of new, non-addictive therapies for pain.
Our lead compound, SER-014 (previously called PHE377 that we acquired from PharmEste), is a transient
receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) receptor antagonist that has been tested in
Phase 1 trials in healthy human subjects. Because TRPV1 is a key channel that mediates pain and inflammation
in endometriosis, our goal is to develop SER-014 as a novel small molecule TRPV1 antagonist for the treatment
of endometriosis as detailed below in our aims.
 Serentrix is collaborating with Dr. Michael Rogers at Children’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School, an expert
in endometriosis research, who has developed and validated a best-in-class mouse model of disease, and Dr.
Megan Falsetta at the University of Rochester Medical Center, an expert in genitopelvic pain research with
extensive experience in the measurement of calcium signaling. Together, we will test SER-014 in this validated
endometriosis model and confirm that it’s mode of action is specific to inhibiting the response to TRPV1 agonists
(e.g., capsaicin), while not dysregulating thermal responses. SER-014, unlike many failed TRPV1 antagonists
does not cause hyperthermia in animals or humans; we will show this is due to its mechanistic specificity.
Aim1: Measure the efficacy of SER-014 against endometriosis-associated pain and lesion size in a
validated mouse model. This will demonstrate the extent to which blood levels achieved by safe doses of SER-
014 can alleviate pain and reduce lesions. In alignment with this HEAL initaitive RFA, we will confirm its efficacy
as a novel, safe, non-addictive treatment for endometriosis, a lifelong condition that destroys quality of life.
Aim 2: Confirm the molecular mechanism through which SER-014 impedes TRPV1 activity without
inducing hyperthermia. This will ascertain that SER-014 is ready to be tested in human studies and is devoid
of side effects that were commonly associated with other TRPV1 receptor antagonists.
 Since SER-014 has already been tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial, our goal is to generate evidence
sufficient to derisk a Phase 2 clinical trial seeking evidence of efficacy in endometriosis."
10918117,"Abstract. The emergence of abnormal movement synergies following a stroke presents a major limitation to the
recovery of independent function by constraining voluntary movements to stereotypical muscle coactivation
patterns. The resulting expression of the flexion synergy limits arm/hand function, like reaching and hand opening;
and has also been reported to be linked to hyperactive stretch reflexes or spasticity. Previous studies found that
flexion synergy and spasticity are associated with the recruitment of contralesional descending cortico-
bulbospinal pathways. However, how the somatosensory system adapts to this change in the use of motor
pathways and the role of adaptive sensory feedback to the abnormal motor control of the paretic arm remain
largely unknown. The ascending sensory pathways that convey somatosensation from the paretic arm project
contralaterally to the primary sensory cortex in the lesioned hemisphere. Our preliminary data, however,
suggests that, in individuals that express the flexion synergy and spasticity, this sensory information is
subsequently transferred to the contralesional hemisphere, a process that may support the manifestation of the
abnormal movement patterns in hemiparetic stroke. The overall goal of the proposed research is to examine
the pathophysiology of this maladaptive hemispheric somatosensory “shift” and its relationship to the upper
limb motor impairments following a hemiparetic stroke. The results will lead to a greater understanding of
abnormal limb synergies and spasticity by closing the sensorimotor loop, which should provide a novel means
by which to therapeutically prevent and mitigate the emergence and expression of upper limb motor impairments,
following a stroke. The proposed research aims to test the following key hypotheses in our specific aims:
Following a unilateral motor stroke, a hemispheric shift in somatosensory processing provides sensory feedback
to support the maladaptive hemispheric shift in the motor system. This hemispheric sensory shift not only
influences volitional movement control which contributes to the expression of the flexion synergy (Aim 1), but
also the transcortical loop of the stretch reflex that is related to the hyperactive stretch reflexes (or spasticity)
and the increased onset delay of the long-latency stretch reflex (Aim 2). Furthermore, the hemispheric sensory
shift, as a result of neuroplasticity in an injured brain, can occur in the absence of motor output; and this sensory
shift can indicate the extent of motor deficits (Aim 3). By testing these hypotheses, the proposed research will
improve our understanding of the role of sensory feedback in post-stroke motor impairments. This should allow
for the determination of motor deficits from a new sensory perspective for more impaired individuals or
acute/subacute patients who have difficulty performing motor tasks. Furthermore, the knowledge gained in this
study will facilitate the future development of targeted, hypothesis-driven therapeutical interventions that aim at
reducing maladaptive cross-hemispheric sensory-motor connectivity during recovery thus, promoting motor
function without inducing abnormal synergy and spasticity impairments."

The goal of this K01 is to determine the role of monocytes in HIV-related depressive symptoms with a focus on
immunometabolic mechanisms that may fuel monocyte activation and trafficking to the brain and serve as
therapeutic targets. Simultaneously, this mentored clinical research experience will provide me with essential
training in immunometabolism, clinical HIV research, and translational approaches to drug design and
discovery to launch my independent career. To achieve these goals, I will integrate clinical studies with
innovative in vitro platforms including a “human blood-brain barrier (BBB)-on-a-chip” and immune cell
metabolic assessments in people with HIV (PWH) treated with the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib. Despite
anti-retroviral therapy, persistent HIV-associated inflammation is thought to impair reward circuits in the brain
and perpetuate motivational deficits like anhedonia and apathy in PWH. Activation of circulating monocytes is a
key driver of inflammation, and transmigration of monocytes across the BBB contributes to inflammation in the
brains of PWH. The mechanisms of monocyte activation and trafficking to the brain are not fully understood but
may involve metabolic reprogramming in monocytes. Activated myeloid cells undergo a metabolic shift to
glycolysis that sustains pro-inflammatory processes such as cytokine release and cellular migration. In patients
with depression and high inflammation, our preliminary data show relationships between anhedonia and
circulating monocytes characterized by glycolysis and markers related to trafficking to the brain. In pre-clinical
models of depression, monocyte trafficking to reward-related brain regions is required for development of
anhedonic behavior, whereas in PWH, activation and BBB transmigration of patient monocytes in vitro are
associated with neurocognitive impairments. Thus, glycolytically activated monocytes may traffic to and/or
across the BBB to promote anhedonia, and determining the role of monocyte metabolism and migration in
inflammation and its impact on the brain is a critical next step to understand and treat motivational deficits in
PWH. Leveraging patients, data, and resources from two ongoing parent studies examining inflammation,
brain circuits, and neuropsychiatric outcomes in PWH before and after baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory drug
shown to reduce HIV-related neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in a pre-clinical model, I will examine
monocyte glycolysis and BBB transmigration as pathways to peripheral and CNS inflammation, reward circuit
deficits, and anhedonia in PWH. As part of this proposal, I will receive focused mentorship in research and
career development from a team of recognized leaders in psychiatry, metabolism, HIV pathophysiology, and
drug development. These studies will provide pilot data and innovative experimental platforms for testing novel
strategies targeting monocyte metabolic and migratory pathways in PWH with psychiatric symptoms in future R
grant proposals and facilitate my independent research program focused on the role of monocytes in
inflammation-associated behavioral symptoms in PWH and other medical or psychiatric illnesses."
10928091,"Consumption or rejection of food are outcomes of a hierarchical multisensory decision-
making process. Food-related decisions must frequently resolve conflicts, such as whether to
consume a fruit that is visually appealing but smells rotten. Such decisions require neural
substrates for evaluating characteristics of food—appearance, smell, taste, touch—and
comparing/contrasting such characteristics to decide whether to approach, assess, and/or
consume. We study food-related decision making in Drosophila melanogaster flies and
Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms, which have simpler behavioral repertoires, are highly
experimentally tractable, and have proven utility at generating biological insights of relevance to
mammalian model systems and human beings. The proposed Drosophila studies provide
detailed mechanistic understanding of the circuit substrates, neuromodulatory pathways, and
neural encoding of sweet/bittersweet food choice in Drosophila, and a foundation for research
more broadly into decision making under conflicting information. The proposed C. elegans
studies provide extensive evidence of worm color detection and the underlying
cellular/molecular mechanisms, revealing pathways that could underlie an evolutionarily
ancient opsin-independent color detection system present in other animals including mammals."
10928092,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Necroptosis is a caspase-independent type of programmed necrosis. The activation of the
necroptosis signaling cascade is implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases,
including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, liver injury, pancreatitis, neurodegenerative
disorders, and a diverse range of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, including SARS-CoV-2.
The necroptosis signaling cascade is mediated by the sequential activation of RIPK1 and RIPK3
kinases downstream of pro-inflammatory ligands such as TNF or microbe-associated
molecules. MLKL is a pseudokinase that tetramerizes upon phosphorylation by RIPK3 to form
water-permeable pores that drive cell membrane rupture. This pore formation stage leads to the
necrotic phenotype of necroptosis. It is also a critical point of cell fate determination, as
necroptosis execution can be halted and reversed at the MLKL stage. The mechanisms
regulating MLKL activation and execution of this type of programmed necrosis are poorly
understood. Here, we will fill in the gaps of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
regulate MLKL activation, tetramerization, and execution of necroptotic cell death via
phosphorylation and ubiquitination. We aim to determine the mechanistic roles of the MLKL
post-translational modification events in promoting or suppressing MLKL tetramerization and
identify the enzymes regulating MLKL-driven necrotic cell death via these events. We also aim
to determine which structural factors are required downstream of MLKL to execute the
necroptotic cell death. Finally, to validate the roles of these enzymes and factors in mediating
necroptosis in vivo, we will test how their genetic knockouts affect sensitivity to Vaccinia virus
infection, contributing to the future development of strategies for enhancing host anti-viral
response. Overall, this project will significantly expand our understanding of the cellular
signaling mechanisms upstream and downstream of MLKL at the necroptosis execution stage
and pave the way for future anti-microbial therapies, as well as treatments for diseases that
involve necroptosis execution."
10928094,"Background/Rationale: Intestinal epithelial barrier integrity is critical for most gastrointestinal (GI)
functions including digestion of food, as well as absorption and secretion of nutrients. The
gastrointestinal mucosal layer is very vulnerable to injury resulting in loss of barrier integrity, and
this occurs very commonly in critically ill Veteran patients in response to surgical stress.
Preventing it would likely have a major impact on outcomes and costs for all critically ill Veteran
populations, though the molecular controls that regulate barrier integrity are incompletely
understood. Current treatment for barrier dysfunction is conservative. This application will explore
a promising approach to preserve, protect, and restore epithelial barrier function by manipulating
the fundamental regulation of intestinal epithelial cells; while improving our overall understanding
of their function and regulation. The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has
recently demonstrated significant effects on endothelial and epithelial cells in promoting important
biological functions, such as survival of injured cells and expression of barrier proteins. We have
demonstrated in previously published work and our preliminary data that S1P has significant
effects on intestinal epithelial cells and the intestinal barrier; both in physiologic and pathologic
conditions, though the details of this mechanistically have not been fully elucidated.
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that S1P protects the intestinal
epithelial barrier in both physiological and pathological states with the eventual goal of having a
therapeutic use for S1P in critically ill patients.
Methods: This proposal includes in vitro studies using cultured intestinal epithelial cells, ex vivo
studies of tissues from mice and humans, and in vivo studies in mice.
Expected Results: We hypothesize that S1P will have significant effects as both an intracellular
2nd messenger and external receptor ligand to promote barrier integrity in cultured cells and in
vivo, during physiological conditions and in pathological states.
Status: Cells exposed to S1P show increased levels of barrier proteins and improved barrier
function. Cells overexpressing Sphingosine Kinase 1, and expressing higher S1P content, show
significantly increased proliferation and a decrease in microRNA (mir) 542 among other findings.
Mice exposed to S1P show improved barrier function in control states and during ischemia-
reperfusion, and also decreased levels of mir 542. MicroRNA 495 inhibits Sphingosine Kinase 1
and shows decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.
Impact: The proposed research addresses critical mechanisms in maintenance of an intact
intestinal mucosal barrier, and in S1P, a potential therapy to preserve this function in critically ill
patients. Critical illness, particularly in surgical patients, is very common and a high percentage of
patients in the intensive care units incur barrier dysfunction. Despite the medical advances of the
past few decades, therapies for these gastrointestinal injuries are, for the most part, conservative
as there is no current pharmacologic therapy available. This proposal explores such a
pharmacologic therapy that could potentially prevent injury and loss of the intestinal epithelial cells
and lead to improved outcomes of critically ill Veteran patients."
10928111,"Abstract:
 Immune cell response to ocular inflammation is involved in various prevalent retinal diseases that lead to
blindness such as glaucoma, age related macular degeneration, uveitis and diabetic retinopathy. However, the
microscopic and translucent nature of circulating and resident immune cells has made study of such cells challenging in
the living eye. Further complicating matters, immune cells move at fast speeds (centimeters/second) when circulating in
big vessels and glacial pace at micrometers/minute when in tissue. This project will combine a number of innovations that
overcome many of these challenges to study single immune cells in the living eye in their response to inflammation. The
use of adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to image mouse retina will provide a noninvasive in vivo
imaging method that can resolve single immune cells and track their behavior through the entire course of inflammation.
With our AOSLO, we have recently demonstrated that phase contrast combined with both fast and time-lapse
videography now enables us to visualize these microscopic immune cells using near infrared light alone and without
fluorescence contrast. Therefore, this project will seek to study immune cell dynamics in two models of inflammation in
the living mouse eye and track the cellular responses to initiation, escalation and resolution. And while the approach is
non-invasive and does not require use of fluorescence, we will combine fluorescence confirmation of specific leukocyte
populations that contribute to the inflammatory response. Our project tackles three synergistic aims to track the dynamic
nature of inflammation using two established models: Model 1) An endotoxin induced uveitis model using
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in vitreous of the eye. This results in an acute, short-term form of inflammation. We will
track the initial escalation of inflammation in the retina by monitoring behavior of tissue resident microglia and systemic
early responder neutrophils. And Model 2) An autoimmune uveitis condition that is induced in a healthy host mouse by
injecting a subpopulation of fluorescent CD4+ T cells that are reactive to interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein from a
different donor mouse. Here, we will characterize the behavior of these foreign reactive T cells in healthy retina, and their
interaction with the host immune system. In both inflammatory models, we will characterize the initiation, escalation,
infiltration and resolution of immune cells in the retina by longitudinally tracking their behavior from hours to days to
months. Finally, in a third aim, we will also study the changes in blood flow in response to these inflammatory models. For
both endotoxin mediated and autoimmune inflammatory models described above, we will monitor structural and functional
changes in retinal vasculature from the largest arteries and veins to single file flow capillaries to understand the interplay
between blood flow and immune cell arrival into the retina. Already, we have observed that the vascular response is not
homogeneous, and arterioles, venules and capillaries respond in different ways to the inflammatory insult and likely
mediate the location, arrival and type of immune cell passage. Together, the longitudinal monitoring of inflammation and
blood flow will provide new insights to the retinal immune response using innovations in high-resolution ophthalmoscopy."

outcomes and prolong the lives of patients diagnosed with some type of cancers, but have failed to provide
survival benefits for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Activation of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)
pathway represents one of the main innate immune sensing pathway to enable natural killer (NK) and T cell
priming against tumor. Intratumoral administration of STING agonists, in particular cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs),
was shown to have significant anti-tumor effects in multiple cancer models, including orthotopic GBM models,
and is currently being tested in a phase 1 clinical trial in advanced cancer patients (NCT0267754339). Limited
bioavailability and stability, however, are limiting factors for clinical CDN development.
We have shown that the formulation of oligonucleotides into SNA structures, i.e., the presentation of
oligonucleotides at high density on the surface of nanoparticles, leads to biochemical and biological properties
that are radically different from those of linear (“free”) oligonucleotides. These include the cellular uptake of SNAs
by a wide variety of cells, the gene regulatory activity of SNAs functionalized with siRNA or antisense DNA
oligonucleotides, and the TLR-agonistic activity of SNAs conjugated with immunostimulatory oligonucleotides.
Importantly, clinical trials with first generation siRNA-based SNAs (NCT03020017; GBM), and toll-like receptor
9 (TLR9)-agonsitic SNAs (NCT03086278; solid cancers) have recently been completed.
Our proposed research is to develop a first-in-class immunotherapy by targeting cGAS – the sensor of cytosolic
dsDNA upstream of STING – with SNAs presenting interferon-stimulating DNA (ISD) oligonucleotides at high
surface density, and to evaluate the potential of SNAcGAS for use in clinical neuro-oncology. This approach is
distinct from other current approaches that target the STING pathway with CDNs and small molecules. By
targeting cGAS, the strategy of using SNAsISD exploits the ability of cGAS to raise STING responses by delivering
dsDNA and inducing the catalytic production of endogenous CDNs. Our use of SNAs addresses the challenges
of delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids through the enhanced uptake of nucleic acids formulated as SNAs, and
furthermore, exploits the polyvalent presentation of oligonucleotides at high density on a nanoparticle template.
Here, the binding of closely-spaced, neighboring dsDNA molecules on the surfaces of SNAs should enhance
the formation of 2:2 dimers of cGAS:DNA and thus lead to potent cGAS activation. In three Specific Aims, we
will optimize the SNA platform for maximum cGAS-STING pathway activation in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1), assess
anti-tumor effect of our lead SNAcGAS architectures together with additional high-activity SNA constructs in vivo
(Aim 2), and evaluate treatment regimens combining SNAcGAS with prioritized immunotherapies, including check
point blockade and pharmacological strategies to inhibit adenosine signaling (Aim 3)."
10928374,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Discrimination is the most prominent stressor in Black individuals' everyday lives and can lead to a host of
detrimental emotional health outcomes. Black adolescents and young adults report coping with racial
discrimination by using alcohol or substances. Adolescent development unfolds amidst a complex system of
relationships influenced by multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, contextual) of the social ecology.
However, most research examining influences of racial discrimination on emotional health and substance use
has focused on individual and interpersonal dimensions of the social ecological system separately. Examining
risk and protective factors across multiple levels among Black youth who experience racial discrimination may
identify novel leverage points for strengths-based interventions that jointly address experiences of
discrimination and substance use to improve emotional health. The overall goal of this study is to examine
Black youth's racial discrimination experiences and illuminate individual, interpersonal, and contextual risk and
protective factors linking discrimination experiences with substance use and emotional health. We will leverage
data and research infrastructure from an ongoing cluster-randomized trial of a racial, gender, and economic
justice intervention for youth. In Aim 1, we will explore the interconnections of individual and interpersonal
factors associated with racial discrimination, emotional health outcomes, and substance use behaviors over
time. In Aim 2, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with Black youth to illuminate their experiences of
racial discrimination and contextual factors influencing substance use behaviors. With committed mentors and
strong institutional support, the PI will receive mentorship, didactic education, and research experience for her
career development in theoretical frameworks, latent class analyses, advanced qualitative methods, and
study management skills. This mentored research experience will prepare her for a K01 application to launch a
career as an independent investigator focused on decreasing the psychological and substance-related impact
of racial discrimination in minoritized groups through applied prevention research."

ABSTRACT
The Boston University P30 CCCR emphasizes rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) epidemiology and
patient-oriented clinical research. The first cycle of our CCCR has been highly productive and successful in
expanding the network of RMD researchers leveraging our expertise and resources. Our CCCR will continue to
serve as a central resource for clinical researchers in RMDs locally, nationally, and internationally who represent
our broader research community. Our CCCR's broad aim is to conduct and disseminate high quality clinical
research in RMDs using state-of-the-art methods and to serve as a central resource for such methods for our
dynamic research community. The Center has also trained many leading clinical researchers in RMDs, and most
continue to have active interactions and collaborations with the Center, including accessing advanced
methodology support and unique data resources. In this cycle, we will continue to provide advanced methodology
support, including in new areas, make our protocols and data resources available, providing training in protocols,
and function as a resource for clinical expertise to those who require such clinical insights and guidance. We will
continue a Pilot & Feasibility grant program to aid early-stage investigators and/or attract new investigators into
the RMD field. We will expand our educational programming and outreach efforts to broaden our impact and
research network. A key focal point of this CCCR is a weekly clinical research meeting known as Research
Accelerator, in which ongoing and proposed research projects are critically evaluated. Specifically, we provide
input into study design, protocol development, and analysis help for multiple projects both within and outside the
Core group, as well as critical feedback for abstracts, manuscripts, presentations, posters, and grants. The
success of our Research Accelerator is evidenced by the publication productivity and grant support garnered by
the Core group and collaborating research community. Our CCCR currently supports 26 grants with Core faculty
as PI, including the current P30, 1 U19, 7 R01s, 1 T32, 1 K23, 1 K24, 11 foundation grants, and 3 industry
research grants, as well as several clinical trials. In addition, CCCR funding has supported ~52 original peer-
reviewed annually in peer-reviewed journals (210 in past 4 years of this cycle), most in leading arthritis journals
and some in leading general medical journals, reflecting both our Core faculty's own research and the Center's
successful assistance and partnerships in the research community. The overall goal of this Center is to carry out
and disseminate high-level clinical research utilizing advanced methodology and informed by biological scientific
discoveries. Ultimately, we aim to prevent the RMDs we are studying and to improve the lives of those living with
these diseases."
10918479,"Following initial diagnosis and treatment, bladder cancer has a high recurrence rate, making it one of the most
expensive cancers to treat over a patient’s lifetime. The current standard of care testing for bladder cancer
recurrence is an invasive medical procedure, cystoscopy. Urine contains a wealth of biomarkers that can
potentially be used to monitor for signs of recurrence and early initiation of treatment. However, commercially
available biomarker-based bladder cancer tests rely on a single type of biomarker, are insufficiently sensitive,
often yield false negative and false positive results, and are time and resource intensive. Therefore, the
development of new approaches that afford high accuracy results are the key to improving patient care and
treatment. To meet this need, Early Is Good developed a bladder cancer diagnostic assay, called BCDx. BCDx
uses advanced nanotechnology to detect twelve different biomarkers directly from a urine sample. The
comprehensive approach is multi-omic multiplex because it measures the concentration of proteins, miRNAs,
mRNAs, and lncRNAs. Feasibility studies demonstrated attomolar sensitivity for each biomarker, with high
positive predictive and negative predictive values for biomarkers that are present in picomolar concentrations in
urine samples derived from healthy volunteers and bladder cancer patients. Moreover, BCDx can distinguish
healthy versus oncogenic samples and can discriminate between low grade and high-grade tumors. In a pilot
clinical study, BCDx demonstrated diagnostic feasibility, reliability, and validity. The goal of this proposal is to
execute a clinical validation study that is designed to complete the acquisition of data required by the FDA for
regulatory clearance through the 510(k) pathway. Beyond setting the state for regulatory clearance, Phase II
completion is expected to help promote the adoption of BCDx by clinicians and healthcare professionals and to
secure reimbursement from payers."

healthcare providers.
Evidence reveals racial/ethnic disparities in the quality of patient-provider communication

We will design a linguistically- and culturally-tailored digital visualization tool that
enhances healthcare conversations by breaking down the information in clear and
comprehensible ways to help the patients better understand what is being discussed and by
removing communication barriers around literacy, numeracy, and education. Patients and
caregivers will also remember what is discussed as all the visual activity that occurs on the

 Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of American
citizens every year, resulting in 500,000 hospitalizations, more than 2 million hospital days, and over
$5 billion in direct costs. GI bleeding often originate from lacerations created following surgical
interventions, such as after polypectomies. The established method to prevent GI bleeding involves
the use of endoscopic clips, which was invented in 1975. However, clips are unable to provide
wound shielding, are technically challenging to apply, and are limited to small lesions only. Novel
powder-based hemostatic products have been suggested; Yet, they lack proper adhesion to
mucosal tissues being quickly dissolved post application, and can only work in actively bleeding
lesions which is not often the case for GI lacerations that bleed days post-surgical intervention. To
address this need, BioDevek has been focusing on the research and development of GastroShield
- a sprayable biocompatible adhesive biomaterial for endoscopic management of GI lesions.
GastroShield is formed by cross-linking of biodegradable polymer solutions (amine-terminated
Poloxamer and oxidized Dextran), designed to be easy-to-use, fast, and also less dependent on
operator skill. Prior to this direct-to-Phase II application, Biodevek obtained critical de-risking
milestones of the technology, including the (1) Identification of the optimal formulation for
gastrointestinal mucosal adhesion, (2) Performing mechanical studies of the technology ensuring
its conformability to the GI features and the catheter spraying application (3) Confirming wound
protection of GastroShield against acid and catabolic agents (4) Conducting preliminary in vitro and
In vivo biocompatibility studies (5) Confirming the acute homeostatic effect and (6) the chronic
protection of gastrointestinal submucosal in a pilot porcine in vivo model. The direct-to-Phase II
project will focus on achieving critical pre-clinical results and quality control levels to support the
regulatory submission. Also, the performance of a pre-submission meeting with the FDA to confirm
the regulatory pathway and design of preclinical studies. Aligned with this goal, we aim at the
completion of key Go/no-Go milestones: I) Scale-up manufacturing of the product and the
development of quality control methods, II) Conducting complete safety studies under GLP
conditions, III) executing an FDA pre-submission meeting to validate the selected in-vivo pre-clinical
model and predicate device for 510(k) submission IV) Conducting efficacy studies comparing
GastroShield to FDA-validated predicate device. Successful execution of these aims will allow
Biodevek to initiate the regulatory approval of GastroShield."

The development of three-dimensional (3D) disease models has paved the way for accelerated
design, discovery, and validation of potential targets and drug compounds, thereby significantly
reducing the time, cost, and labor involved in the drug discovery pipeline. 3D spheroidal cell
aggregate models have been established as more accurate and predictive than two-dimensional
(2D) models for drug screening. However, current commercial techniques for spheroidal tissue
formation rely heavily on the self-aggregation of single cells and have substantial limitations
concerning production consistency, control, and flexibility. That makes VivoSphere a
breakthrough product. VivoSpheres are cell-laden hydrogel microspheres that are produced
rapidly using our microfluidic platform. Compared to self-aggregation systems, incorporation of
hydrogel matrices in VivoSpheres can improve the consistency of tissues in size and shape, which
is critical in getting high-quality results in high-throughput screening (HTS), and provide the ability
to manipulate the cellular microenvironment, which is an important driver of appropriate cell
phenotype and function. The cell types will no longer be limited to self-aggregating cells. Instead,
there will be great flexibility in selecting either aggregating or non-aggregating cells, and even
multiple cell types for co-encapsulation. This project will use cancer cells to demonstrate the high
consistency of VivoSpheres as more suitable for HTS compared to self-aggregation systems,
establish the ability to form VivoSpheres using non-aggregating cancer cells, and optimize key
assays used in HTS. The outcome of this project will remove potential roadblocks to building
disease-specific models for HTS. VivoSphere is VivoSphere LLC’s first product and is protected
by non-provisional patents."

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) encompasses a range of common processes and pathologies
(arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, small vessel atherosclerosis, small and microscopic infarcts and
bleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and white matter disease) that we and others have shown are associated
with impaired cognition and dementia (VCID). High-quality biomarkers of SVD are critically needed to advance
diagnosis, prevention and treatment of small vessel VCID. The mission of the MarkVCID consortium has been to
identify the most promising biomarkers of SVD, and conduct analytical (instrumental) validation and preliminary
clinical validation. Our team at Rush University Medical Center and Illinois Institute of Technology was privileged to
be active participants in this initial work. We are now eager to continue this collaborative effort with this proposal.
The objective of the proposed project is to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical validation of MarkVCID-selected
biomarkers in a diverse cohort free of dementia, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers with SVD
neuropathologic indices, working synergistically with other consortium sites and contributing scientific expertise,
experimental infrastructure, and scientific guidance. Specifically, we propose to recruit, enroll and longitudinally
assess a large, diverse, community-based group of older adults without dementia using MarkVCID clinical
evaluation and biomarkers, to test the hypotheses that the biomarkers are associated with cognitive decline and
SVD neuropathologic indices. This will be a nested sub-study of participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project
(MAP), Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), Religious Orders Study (ROS), Clinical Core (CC) and Latino Core
(LATC) of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, which are on-going longitudinal, clinical-pathologic
cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates. MARS and CC recruit
exclusively African American, and LATC recruits Latino older adults. Our past contributions in MarkVCID support
our current aims. First, we demonstrated our ability to recruit and follow a large and diverse group of non-demented
older adults, some of whom died, enabling autopsy studies. Second, we developed and made publicly available a
novel biomarker of arteriolosclerosis with high performance, named ARTS, which we trained using machine
learning on MRI and pathology data. Third, we contributed to the analytical and initial clinical validation of multiple
MarkVCID biomarkers. Fourth, we led the MarkVCID imaging biomarkers committee and were active in all functions
of the consortium. We propose to leverage our expertise and infrastructure to conduct rigorous longitudinal clinical
validation of MarkVCID biomarkers in a diverse population, and to investigate the associations of these biomarkers
with SVD neuropathologic indices."
10923991,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
A rich network of sensory afferents in the ocular surface (OS), supplied by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal
nerve, performs a multitude of physiological functions, including sensation, regulation of various reflexes, and
secretion of trophic and growth factors. Of the OS structures, the cornea is the most highly innervated tissue in
the body. As such, dysfunction of the corneal/OS nerves has been shown to underlie a wide range of diseases,
including trauma, infections, metabolic imbalances, and therapeutic interventions such as refractive surgeries.
Corneal diseases continue to be a major health problem in the US, and corneal nerve dysfunction contributes to
many of these disorders, such as neurotrophic keratitis, corneal neuropathic pain, and dry eye disease (DED).
DED alone has been shown to impact up to 75% of a given population, causing significant reduction in quality
of life and increased risk for visually debilitating opacities. Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of
corneal sensory nerves is critical for understanding the pathophysiology leading to OS diseases. To meet this
challenge and in response to the FOA RFA-EY-21-004 on OS innervation, we have assembled an
interdisciplinary team with a strong collaborative track record and complementary expertise, including eye
disease models and wound healing (Lee); pain and the mammalian somatosensory system (Luo); intravital
corneal nerve fiber imaging and regeneration (Rompolas); single-cell transcriptomics/epigenomics and
related computational analyses (Wu); and neurophysiology and data analysis/machine learning (Ding). We
propose to combine advanced imaging approaches, novel single-cell multi-omics, and cutting-edge mouse
genetic models to perform three levels of analysis: 1) Morphology - using single neuron genetic labeling, we will
resolve the fine morphology, spatial organization, and connectivity of corneal sensory neurons by visualizing
axonal arborization in the cornea and brainstem/spinal cord. We will also examine interactions of individual
sensory afferents and corneal epithelial cells. 2) Molecular - we will perform integrated single-cell transcriptomics
and epigenomics to interrogate the subtype-specific marker gene expression and epigenetic landscape of the
corneal sensory neurons. 3) Functional - we will perform real-time physiologic analyses of corneal sensory
afferents using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. To further elucidate the role of sensory nerves in OS
pathophysiology, we will determine how their morphology, molecular profile, and responsiveness are altered in
a surgically induced DED model. Moreover, we will implement a novel high-speed imaging and machine learning
platform to quantify evoked responses to corneal sensory stimuli and spontaneous behavior in the DED model.
Taken together, our study will generate a comprehensive data set poised for integration that will fill in critical
knowledge gaps in the field, create a robust foundation for future studies, and inform the development of more
precise therapeutic strategies to treat OS diseases."
10923996,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes over 34,800 cancers in the United States each year that disproportionately
affect Black women. The HPV vaccine is highly effective, but less than half of adolescents aged 13-15 years
have received recommended doses, with Blacks having the greatest disparity in completion. HPV vaccine
hesitancy is associated with under-vaccination and refusal. An estimated 23% of parents with adolescents are
hesitant about the HPV vaccine, but parents’ concerns vary due to a myriad of individual, interpersonal, and
sociocultural factors. Effective strategies to overcome parents’ concerns are needed, especially among Black
families, who have higher prevalence of general vaccine hesitancy and medical mistrust due to racial inequities.
The purpose of this NCI Transition Career Development Award (K22) is to support me through specific training
and research experiences as I become an independent investigator specializing in multilevel cancer prevention
interventions to reduce cervical cancer disparities. Building on my strong health services research and behavioral
science background in HPV screening, I will develop expertise in HPV vaccination communication, community-
engaged intervention planning, and intervention trials. The objectives of this rigorous mixed methods proposal
are to: (1) use a stakeholder-engaged approach to develop and refine an interactive, tailored text messaging
intervention to address Black parents’ HPV vaccine hesitancy determinants and vaccination barriers; and (2)
conduct a two-arm pilot RCT to determine feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and preliminary efficacy of
the tailored messages compared to untailored messages. Following a provider’s initial recommendation, the
intervention will allow parents of young adolescents to process HPV vaccination information on their preferred
timeline, answer lingering questions and concerns, provide links to additional information from trusted sources,
and support connections to local resources to help overcome barriers. By accomplishing these aims, I will
address current gaps in strategies to increase vaccine confidence and motivation among high-risk Black families.
Rutgers Cancer Institute with its well-funded behavioral research program, robust research infrastructure, and
deep community connections is an exceptional environment to conduct high-impact, community-engaged cancer
disparities research. As a logical next step in my career development, this K22 will give me the skills required to
design, implement, and evaluate multilevel interventions to achieve HPV health equity. Findings and preliminary
efficacy estimates will inform an R01 application of a multi-site trial to test a multiple component intervention
addressing the complex, context-specific determinants of HPV vaccine hesitancy to motivate vaccination and
change behaviors. Ultimately, this K22 proposal will facilitate my long-term goal to build an independent research
program investigating community-driven solutions to reduce HPV disparities and advance the elimination of
cervical cancer."
10918867,"Project Summary/Abstract
Metabolic reprograming has been readily recognized as the hallmark of cancer. Specifically, three-
dimensional (3D) cell system is well documented to regain intrinsic metabolic properties and to better
mimic the in vivo situation than two-dimensional (2D) cell system. We have shown that Kaposi’s
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an etiological agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and pleural
effusion lymphoma, specifically alters host spermidine and proline syntheses in a 3D-dependent
manner, contributing to the LANA-mediated latent episomal maintenance for viral persistency and
oncogenesis, which is a crux of this application. As this KSHV-mediated spermidine and proline
biosynthesis reprograming is also shared by most non-viral cancers, this study will contribute to
understanding general cancer metabolic reprograming."
10919649,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Obesity is a major public health problem in the United States. It is linked to insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes, two devastating diseases that affect millions of Americans. Current treatments for obesity have
largely failed to achieve long-term success, highlighting the need for new, long-term sustainable strategies.
Our goal is to develop a preventive and complementary nutritional intervention for obesity and its associated
insulin resistance that is non-invasive, long-lasting, and low-cost. We are particularly interested in the potential
of Clostridium cochlearium 2316 (CC), a proprietary bacterial strain that has demonstrated significant and
consistent activities in reducing obesity and insulin resistance. CC is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that
has been found in the gut of many mammals, including humans. Unlike certain known pathogenic Clostridium
species, CC is considered safe for humans, as it is classified as a Biological Safety Level (BSL)-1 bacterium.
Our preliminary studies have illuminated CC's potential. Dietary supplementation with CC led to substantial
alterations in the gut microbiome and resulted in a 22% reduction in body weight gain among high-fat diet-
induced obese (DIO) mice, all without impacting food intake. Moreover, CC intake led to a significant 47%
reduction in insulin resistance and complete restoration of glucose homeostasis in obese mice. Notably, CC
displayed no toxicity, and no traces of antibiotic-resistant genes or virulence factors were detected. These
consistent findings substantiate the potential nutraceutical application of CC in obesity management. In this
Phase I proposal, we are seeking support for critical toxicity and safety assessments of CC for long-term
dietary interventions, as mandated for IND-required studies preceding clinical trials. Specifically, our aims are
twofold: Aim 1: To elucidate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of acute CC ingestion in DIO mice,
a crucial step towards ensuring the safe and effective use of CC. Aim 2: To determine the long-term efficacy
and safety of CC treatment in mitigating obesity and insulin resistance in DIO mice. These findings hold utmost
importance as they set the stage for subsequent transformative research endeavors in clinical evaluation.
Following the confirmation of its long-term safety and efficacy in this study, CC is poised to pursue FDA
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status. Such a designation would enable CC's inclusion as a food
ingredient or additive within legal bounds, thereby enabling its formulation as a dietary supplement. Our study
will open a new avenue using a novel probiotic as a safe, low cost, and long-term sustainable dietary
supplement/medical food for obesity management. This study is significant because it will not only provide
mechanistic insights into how CC reduces diet-induced obesity, but will also provide long-term safety and
efficacy data to be readily used for clinical trials to further confirm its effects on obesity and metabolic
outcomes, which if shown to be efficacious, would have an immediate and strong impact on public health given
the obesity epidemic in the United States."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Emotion communication is a fundamental part of spoken language. For patients with hearing loss who use
cochlear implants (CIs), detecting emotions in speech presents a significant challenge. Deficits in vocal
emotion perception observed in both children and adults with CIs have been linked with poor self-reported
quality of life. For young children, learning to identify others’ emotions and express one’s own emotions is
fundamental to social development. For adults, social communication is key to developing and maintaining
social and professional networks and reducing the risk of social isolation. Yet, little is known about the
mechanisms and factors that shape vocal emotion communication by children and adults with CIs. Primary
cues to vocal emotions (voice characteristics such as pitch) are degraded in CI hearing, but secondary cues
such as duration and intensity remain accessible to patients. Large, unexplained intersubject variability has
been found in CI patients’ emotion identification and in emotions produced by children with CIs. Lack of
knowledge about the sources of such variability presents a significant barrier to progress in CIs. The focus of
this proposal is on the acoustic cues to emotion and how they are used by individual CI patients for the
perception and production of emotional speech. In this application, we propose to test the novel mechanistic
hypothesis that factors that may predict spoken emotion identification and production by CI patients – such as
how long they have had their device (duration of device experience), their age at implantation and their access
to residual acoustic hearing -- act by changing the relative use of primary/secondary acoustic cues (“cue-
weighting”) by the individual patient.
Over the last decade, we have conducted foundational research that provided valuable information about key
predictors of vocal emotion perception and production by pediatric and adult CI recipients. The work
proposed here will build on this body of work and extend it by using novel methodologies to measure CI users’
reliance on different acoustic cues to emotion (“cue-weighting”). In Aim 1, we will test the following hypotheses:
[H1] that cue-weighting accounts significantly for inter-subject variations in vocal emotion identification by CI
users; [H2] that optimization of cue-weighting patterns is the mechanism by which predictors such as the
duration of device experience and age at implantation benefit vocal emotion identification, In Aim 2, we will test
the hypothesis [H3] that in children with CIs, perceptual cue-weighting, together with early auditory experience
(e.g., age at implantation and/or presence of usable hearing at birth) accounts significantly for inter-subject
variation in emotional productions.
The knowledge gained from these studies will provide the evidence-base to support the development of clinical
protocols that support emotional communication by child and adult CI patients and will thus benefit quality
of life for CI users across the life span."
10920319,"Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is widely recommended by the medical community. Breastfed
infants have lower risk of SIDS, severe lower respiratory disease, ear and gastrointestinal infections, leukemia,
and diabetes than infants fed formula. Breastfeeding mothers benefit from reduced risk of cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer. Despite these benefits, only one in four infants
is exclusively breastfed at six months due, in part, to lactation and human milk-pumping challenges. Many
bottles, pacifiers, nipple shields, and pump parts (“Infant Feeding Accessories,” (IFA)) are marketed, but none
are customized to the breastfeeding parent’s actual anatomy. The American Academy of Pediatrics and World
Health Organization advise avoidance of artificial nipples for breastfed babies; however, these products are
commonly used, and early avoidance of them can lead to increased stress for parents struggling to establish
breastfeeding, and to bottle refusal by breastfed infants. The creation of IFAs customized to the lactating
parent's anatomy, as contemplated in U.S. Patent No. 10,449,121 B2 and U.S. Patent Application No.
17/954,324,7 (“Customized Accessories” (CA)), could improve the fit of IFAs, improve milk flow, decrease pain
for the lactating parent, eliminate nipple confusion, prolong breastfeeding, and support transition to direct
breastfeeding for preterm infants. In Phase I of this project, UC Davis, in conjunction with CBEZ, LLC, will
conduct foundational research to: (1) Characterize the critical design features of the CA and their related
mobile health (mHealth) platform that would make them acceptable and feasible for lactating parents and their
infants to use; and (2) Develop a preliminary catalog of prototype customized nipples and a process by which a
scan or photos of a lactating parent’s nipple, areola, and surrounding breast tissue (“Nipple Image”) is matched
with the most similar customized nipple in the catalog. The project will be managed by a CBEZ, LLC, a small
business that consists of an engineer with more than 37 years of experience leading multi-disciplinary research
projects; a patented inventor who is the inventor of U.S. Patent No. 10,449,121 B2; a project management
consultant with experience managing multidisciplinary web user interface projects; and a team of machine
learning specialists. UC Davis’ team consists of Dr. Laura Kair, a pediatrician who conducts clinical trials and
qualitative research focused on overcoming breastfeeding barriers; Dr. Melissa Chen, an obstetrician/
gynecologist and clinical researcher who has expertise in conducting clinical research among breastfeeding
women; and Steven Lucero, a biomedical engineer who is the Laboratory Manager of the Translating
Engineering Advances to Medicine Lab, an advanced prototyping lab specializing in 3D scanning and additive
manufacturing that includes anatomical models. After the successful completion of this project, the team will be
well-positioned to further develop and produce CA, and to conduct additional research to determine efficacy of
CA on breastfeeding success, thereby impacting maternal and child health across the lifecourse."
10921430,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of this project is to develop a solution that allows for rapid, safe, and
scalable initial treatment and transport of patients with highly transmissible infectious diseases, including
COVID-19 as well influenza, tuberculosis, chickenpox, and measles. This is a necessary innovation because
resource management and infectious transmission control were two of the greatest challenges healthcare
providers faced when fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. When a patient is suffering from highly transmissible
respiratory diseases and requires breathing assistance, they are placed in negative pressure rooms.
However, given the limited supply of negative pressure rooms available to prevent virus transmission, and
the misperception regarding the safety and effectiveness of negative pressure rooms, a new solution is
needed. To help prevent the spread of highly transmissible infectious diseases, start-up company Inspire Rx
has developed a personal negative pressure device called the AerosolVE™ BioHelmet. The BioHelmet is
capable of preventing the spread of aerosolized pathogens while also enabling the use of non-invasive
oxygen therapies on patients with respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, tuberculosis, etc. The
negative pressure AerosolVE™ BioHelmet immediately isolates patients with any highly transmissible
respiratory infectious disease and serves as an instant personal negative pressure environment that is more
effective than a traditional negative pressure room. The BioHelmet is intended to provide safe transportation
via ambulance, airplane, or helicopter, allowing critical transportation staff to remain safe, and it will be
valuable in a variety of other healthcare settings. In this project the team will refine and further evaluate the
AerosolVE BioHelmet, and they will leverage data from their previous in-cabin particle testing to advance the
BioHelmet as an effective tool at keeping a vehicle/transport cabin free from potentially pathogenic
respiratory particles. They will first refine the BioHelmet design to reduce noise and weight, and they will
fabricate 100 AerosolVE BioHelmets and 20 pump units for follow-on bench testing and clinical user
evaluations (Aim 1). They will conduct performance and bench testing at FDA-approved labs to ensure the
safety and efficacy of the AerosolVE BioHelmet per FDA guidelines (Aim 2). They will deploy the helmet for
clinical patient use during ground and air ambulance transportation of patients with suspected or confirmed
communicable respiratory illness, including those requiring potential aerosol-generating procedures, and the
purpose of this will be to obtain user feedback on comfort and east of use from patients and providers (Aim
3). The BioHelmet will provide a novel, compact, portable, and inexpensive solution that offers a safe
negative pressure environment both inside and outside the hospital, which will ultimately save lives by
allowing for needed patient treatments and protecting healthcare workers."
10914904,"Project Abstract
Dysregulation of protein kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of most human cancers. Although targeting
kinases has been an effective therapeutic strategy in diverse cancer types, limited druggable targets, tumor
heterogeneity and drug resistance remain problems in kinase-targeted cancer therapies. Finding new modulators 
of kinase activity in complex cancer models is therefore an urgent need, but current kinase activity measurement 
methods suffer from being low throughput and only provide surrogates for kinase activity.
This proposal aims to apply the latest sample multiplexing technologies using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reagents 
and mass spectrometry to create a novel, multi-pathway, high-throughput, direct kinase activity readout assay
and apply it to profile kinase activity for drug screening. An in vitro peptide phosphorylation assay provides a 
way to directly measure kinase activities for many pathways, while TMT increases throughput by sample 
multiplexing. First, I will select peptide substrates to represent specific kinase pathways (e.g., AKT, SRC, MAPK, 
CDK, etc.) and create a high-throughput in vitro kinase assay based on the TMT reagents. This assay will then 
be adapted to a 96-well plate format (Aim1). In Aim2, I will expand the assay to a three-dimensional (3D) cell 
culture model, profile and compare the kinase activities in response to 137 known kinase inhibitors in both 
standard two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell culture models. In Aim3, I will perform high-throughput profiling of 
kinase activities across a library of 3200 compounds in both 2D and 3D ovarian cancer models using the 96-well 
plate platform for drug screening. Upon completion of these Aims, I will have developed and applied a highly 
optimized method for direct kinase activity measurement. This novel assay will result in the ability to quantitatively 
measure the activation state of dozens of signaling pathways directly from cellular lysates and, therefore, identify 
kinase modulators for future drug development.
This proposal draws on my training in mass spectrometry-based method development and kinase and cancer 
biology. However, to ensure completion of the goals and successful transition to independence, I have a detailed 
training plan, under the guidance of my mentors Dr. Steven Gygi and Dr. Joan Brugge, as well as my advisory 
team, Dr. Peter Sicinski, Dr. Jennifer Smith and Dr. Joao Paulo. During the mentored phase, I plan to (1) deepen
my understanding of mass spectrometry instrumentation, (2) develop new expertise in drug screening, (3) 
strengthen my knowledge base in cancer biology, especially in 3D cell culture and cellular signaling, and (4) 
enhance my scientific writing and communication skills while gaining experience in lab management and 
leadership. The environment at Harvard Medical School presents an excellent opportunity for training in drug 
screening and cancer biology. The proposed research strategy combined with the career development training 
outlined herein will provide the necessary elements for my successful transition to an independent investigator 
in the fields of mass spectrometry and cancer biology."

Training the next generation of HIV prevention scientists, skilled in the methods of multiple fields, and
increasing the number of under-represented minority researchers are the long-term goals of the postdoctoral
Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies (TAPS) at UCSF. Our goals are to build the skills of postdoctoral
fellows to engage in research that: 1) combines biomedical, behavioral, social and structural interventions to
maximize impact, 2) eliminates racial/ethnic disparities in HIV in the US, and 3) develops novel prevention
interventions. TAPS balances the behavioral and biomedical sides of prevention by training scientists newly
minted in their respective fields in the disciplines of their co-postdoctoral fellows. TAPS is housed in UCSF’s
Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) within the Division of Prevention Science, with close relationships
to other institutions within the AIDS Research Institute (ARI) umbrella. The program requires one-on-one
mentorship with senior faculty; a master’s degree in clinical or public health research; advanced courses in
research methods and ethics; seminars and grand rounds; peer review and teaching; designing, grant writing,
and implementing research projects; and submission of papers for publication. Since inception, TAPS has
trained 132 fellows. Our recruitment has more than doubled from a cumulative proportion of 22% under-
represented minorities (URM) in 2003-2007 to 50% for the last 15 year period (2008-2023). We also achieved
100% retention of URM in research. Alumni in the last 10 years produced 704 publications, including 267
(38%) as first author, mean=19.6 papers/trainee. In addition, they were awarded 86 research grants, 68 (79%)
they served as Principal Investigator (PI). Five-year renewal of TAPS will permit training of 1 - 3 new fellows
per year who we envision will be poised to lead the charge to Ending the HIV Epidemic and carry on to
address major future health issues in the US and worldwide."
10924356,"Title: Correlative cryoET of the HIV-1 integration targeting in native T-lymphocytes
Project Summary
Retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), integrate their genetic material into the
host cell genome during their replication cycle. In the case of HIV-1, upon entering a host cell, viral RNA is
reverse transcribed into a double-stranded viral DNA (vDNA) by the viral reverse transcriptase. This vDNA, along
with other viral and cellular proteins, forms a preintegration complex (PIC), which translocates into the host cell
nucleus to the gene-dense transcriptionally active open chromatin regions where the viral DNA is inserted into
the host cell genome by viral integrase. Integration is an essential step for establishing a persistent infection in
the host.
The integrated viral DNA becomes part of the host cell's genome as proviral DNA and its positioning within the
chromatin architecture plays a pivotal role in HIV-1 pathogenesis. While extensive data from genetic, biochemical
and imaging studies point to integration targeting at gene-dense and transcriptionally active chromatin, the
chromatin architecture at these sites, however, has remained elusive. This is largely due to the difficulties in
obtaining high-resolution in situ images of native chromatin in intact cells using cryoET, further compounded by
the challenges to locate the integration targeting sites through correlative approaches. Building on our recent
exciting results on resolving individual nucleosome and chromatin fiber structures within intact native T-
lymphocytes using cutting-edge cryo-focused-ion-beam technology (cryoFIB) and cryoET, we aim to address
these challenges by developing novel correlative technologies for integration targeting and determine their
architectures using advanced in situ structural biology methodologies. Specifically, we will create capsid and
integrase dual-labelled virions, develop Quantum Dot labelling of vDNA, along with fluorescence labelling of host
factors in T-lymphocytes for the correlative approaches to determine the molecular architecture of integration
targeting sites. We will further investigate structural alterations resulting from changes in the integration targeting
by disrupting crucial interactions between HIV-1 and host factors. The proposed research will not only fill a critical
knowledge gap in our understanding of HIV-1 integration targeting but also push the boundaries of correlative
and in-situ cryoET to achieve resolutions previously considered unattainable, facilitating progress in studies
beyond those proposed here."

 In sub-Saharan Africa, universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant and breastfeeding
persons, known as Option B+, has rapidly expanded ART access in low and middle-income countries, yielding
declines in vertical HIV transmission and improvements in viral suppression. However, disengagement from
perinatal HIV care in the perinatal period has emerged as a major challenge to sustaining the success of
Option B+. Interventions to support sustained engagement in perinatal HIV care are urgently needed.
 Perinatal depression (PND) is common among WLHIV and is an important barrier to HIV care engagement.
PND is defined as onset of depression in pregnancy and/or within the first 3-6 months postpartum. Among
WLHIV in sub-Saharan Africa, 30-40% experience prenatal depression and 20%-30% experience postnatal
depression. PND in WLHIV has been linked to increased HIV viral load, postpartum disengagement from HIV
care, and reduced infant HIV testing, making PND an important barrier to reaching UNAIDS 2025 goals and
ending the HIV epidemic. To address these gaps, NIMH (NOT-MH-21-270) has prioritized testing interventions
to address PND among WLHIV in the perinatal period, including their impact on HIV-related outcomes among
the mothers and their infants. However, few evidence-based interventions exist that address both perinatal
mental health and HIV care outcomes for WLHIV, and even fewer are positioned for rapid translation into
practice through incorporation of a rigorous implementation science framework at the effectiveness trial stage.
 Funded by NIMH (R34MH116806), our team enhanced The Friendship Bench, an evidence-based
counseling intervention, to address PND and HIV care engagement for WLHIV. In a pilot individually
randomized controlled trial, the Enhanced Friendship Bench demonstrated high levels of acceptability,
feasibility, and fidelity to the intervention protocol, as well as preliminary efficacy to improve both PND and
engagement in HIV care for WLHIV in Malawi.
 Building on this work, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of the Enhanced Friendship
Bench, compared to usual care, in a fully powered randomized controlled trial to improve PND, HIV care
engagement, and secondary infant health outcomes through 12 months postpartum; test hypothesized
mediators and moderators that will help elucidate mechanisms of intervention action; and collect key
implementation science metrics in a Hybrid Type I design to accelerate translation of findings into practice.
 Our team is exceptionally well qualified to address these aims given our development and enhancement of
the Friendship Bench for perinatal WLHIV; our expertise in HIV, perinatal mental health, and implementation
science; and our longstanding research infrastructure in Malawi. Completion of the proposed aims will shift
clinical practice by providing a culturally appropriate, scalable counseling intervention that improves PND and
engagement in HIV care outcomes for WLHIV that is poised for rapid translation into practice."
10924590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV incidence is unacceptable with the availability of highly effective, evidenced-based methods of treatment
and prevention. Biomedical HIV prevention has extended beyond pill-based strategies to now include long-
acting injectable HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAI-PrEP) via cabotegravir administered by intramuscular
injection in the gluteus muscle every 8 weeks. It is heralded as a “game-changer,” but implementation of LAI-
PrEP is unjustifiably suboptimal. LAI-PrEP has high consumer demand based on priority populations’
preferences, yet few providers are currently prescribing cabotegravir for LAI-PrEP. Importantly, LAI-PrEP has
potential to reduce disparities in PrEP use among the most vulnerable based on preliminary evidence
indicating better HIV protection for Black cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men
compared to daily oral PrEP, and long-acting antiretroviral therapy was found to be particularly effective in
helping patients with unstable housing, mental illnesses, and substance use disorder achieve HIV viral
suppression. Implementation research is needed to support further roll-out of PrEP as an umbrella prevention
strategy, yet LAI-PrEP has unique implications for clinical practice that will not easily fit within implementation
strategies for oral PrEP. A better understanding of how these specific factors impact roll-out is needed to
address enduring barriers and guide implementation considerations. As such, this proposal aims to: (1) identify
enduring barriers and facilitators to LAI-PrEP implementation in the U.S., (2) determine optimal implementation
strategies for LAI-PrEP in partnership with stakeholders, and (3) pilot an implementation strategy within two
outpatient clinics in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. To help guide this formative work, the team leverages the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to understand determinants of LAI-PrEP
implementation and uses two Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change strategies rated with high
feasibility and high importance to maximize potential impact in supporting LAI-PrEP roll-out. The investigators
propose an action-oriented project using principles of community-based participatory research to engage and
collaborate with providers, community members, and stakeholders to support implementation. Preliminary
impact of LAI-PrEP implementation will be evaluated using RE-AIM, assessing Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance via electronic medical records review, survey, and exit interviews.
Exit interviews will also determine feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the implementation strategy.
This projects’ target on LAI-PrEP is timely, uses an innovative sampling approach to study providers’
perspectives, and is positioned to bring forth paradigm-shifting approaches to incorporate LAI-PrEP into clinical
practice. This proposal is led by an experienced early-stage investigator in collaboration with a multidisciplinary
investigative team, compliments research supporting oral PrEP implementation, and sets the stage for larger
scale implementation efforts to enhance integration of LAI-PrEP into clinical practice."
10924672,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Multiple epidemics converge in the lived experiences of those at multiple intersecting minoritized social
positions. People who identify as women experience gender-based violence, are vulnerable to HIV
transmission, and face grave structural social inequities that contribute to poor health outcomes. In particular,
minoritized women – BIPOC women, transgender (or trans) women, and BIPOC trans women (the
intersectional interplay of minoritized sex, gender and race/ethnicity) – are at heightened vulnerability. Today’s
contemporary social, legal, and cultural environment threatens the rights of women, especially minoritized
women, in a milieu with a growing absence of protections for reproductive health, gender affirmative care, self-
determination, and bodily autonomy. The systemic divestment of power away from women promotes a society
whose structures are emboldened to perpetuate oppressive intersectional ideologies that make women more
vulnerable to HIV transmission and poorer health outcomes. Disparities in HIV prevalence and care are
especially high among trans women of color and cis women of color, creating a disparity within a disparity.
Educational opportunities to advance gender and health justice research and practice are critical to end these
multiple intersectional epidemics. Our proposed project includes several short courses designed to
complement and enhance the training of a new generation of the public health workforce in diverse career
stages to gain strong understanding and skills in methods to advance the intersection of HIV prevention and
gender and health justice. Our focus will be on undergraduate students, MPH students, and community health
workers. The proposed project will build on the intellectual capital and infrastructure of the world-class
University of California Center for Gender and Health Justice.

Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a critical public health problem affecting approximately 296
million individuals worldwide and resulting in 820,000 deaths every year due to severe liver disease progression.
Developing new antivirals for the intervention of chronic HBV infection and a better understanding of the
underlying mechanisms of HBV persistence are urgently needed for increasing the low HBV cure rate in patients,
which is hampered by deficiencies in current animal models susceptible to HBV infection. The Eastern
woodchuck (Marmota monax), naturally infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) that is closely related
to HBV, is a well-established, immunocompetent and outbred animal model for the study of HBV infection and
for the preclinical evaluation of new anti-HBV drugs. However, sequence and structural differences between
HBV and WHV make the development of HBV-specific drugs rather challenging in this model. Our preliminary
in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that a modified HBV construct maintains replication competence in human
and woodchuck hepatic cell lines and that cell culture-derived virions infect adult woodchucks, although at a very
low level. Other preliminary in vitro data indicate that modified woodchuck hepatoma cells support the entire life
cycle of HBV. Thus, we propose to explore the possibility of productively infecting woodchucks with HBV by
either a modified virus in Aim 1 or a modified host in Aim 2 for continued development of the woodchuck as an
animal model for chronic HBV infection. Under Aim 1, this will be achieved by additional passage of HBV-
containing woodchuck serum from our preliminary study in adult woodchucks. Animals will be either
immunocompetent to allow continued viral adaption to the woodchuck immune system, as well as hepatocytes,
or immunosuppressed to provide more time and opportunities for viral evolution and continued host adaption in
the absence of immune pressure. Sequence analysis of adapted/evolved HBV in serum and liver of these
animals will identify possible mutations in viral promoter/enhancer elements and the core gene critical for
woodchuck adaption, and thus will allow to engineer additional HBV constructs with increased infection efficiency
for subsequent evaluation in adult woodchucks. The best performing HBV, either adapted/evolved or engineered,
will then be used for the infection of neonatal woodchucks to allow the establishment of chronic HBV infection
and liver disease progression, including development of hepatocellular carcinoma, as it is typically observed in
humans. Under Aim 2, this will be accomplished by infection of adult woodchucks with wildtype or engineered
HBV after rendering the host’s liver cells permissive to the virus. These animals will be either immunocompetent
for proof-of-concept of transient, resolving HBV infection or immunosuppressed to enable chronic HBV infection
in the absence of an immune response. Successful completion of the proposed research will have a significant

Sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual) are 6-7 times as likely as heterosexual women to meet criteria for
alcohol use disorder, indicating a disproportionately high risk of hazardous drinking (HD) and associated negative health
outcomes. SMW's elevated HD risk is believed to be caused, in large part, by lifetime exposure to multiple and chronic
stressors. Although the association between stress and HD is well-established, little is known about how relationship
characteristics influence stress and HD among SMW. Intimate relationships confer many benefits and are protective
against stress-related negative health outcomes. Conversely, relationship stress may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors,
such as HD. The proposed study aims to understand the role of HD within same-sex female couples using both qualitative
and quantitative data at both the individual- and couple-levels. The specific aims for the K99 phase are to: 1) Explore
associations among couple-level relationship factors, stressors, and HD; and 2) Identify individual-level experiences
within same-sex female couples that influence drinking behaviors. The major goals of this Pathway to Independence
Award are the acceleration and completion of Dr. Cindy Veldhuis' training in alcohol-related research and the launching
of her career as an independent scientist with a tenure-track assistant professor position. Dr. Veldhuis is a psychologist
and a postdoctoral fellow funded by an NIH/NIAAA F32 National Service Research Award (F32AA025816) at Columbia
University. The two-year K99 phase will complete Dr. Veldhuis' training in sexual-orientation-related health disparities in
HD. With mentorship, Dr. Veldhuis will: 1) recruit and interview a sample of same-sex female couples (N=50 couples)
from the New York City area; 2) use a mixed-methods approach to examine HD and stress within couples to understand
predictors of HD in this at-risk population; 3) attend courses, seminars, and conferences related to alcohol use and misuse,
sexual minority health, mixed-methods and dyadic analyses, and professional development; 4) lead her own study on
SMW's health; 5) disseminate her findings; and 6) secure a tenure-track faculty position at a research-intensive university.
The proposed primary mentor Dr. John Pachankis, co-mentors Dr. LeBlanc and Dr. Hughes, and advisory panel members
Drs. Stone, George, Keyes, and Schrimshaw are experts in key components of the proposed K99/R00 and collectively
provide expertise ideally suited to facilitate the successful completion of the proposed training and research activities.
Columbia University is one of the world's most respected research centers and a world-class institution, and thus has the
resources needed for successful completion of the training (K99) phase of this proposed award. The three-year R00 phase
will allow Dr. Veldhuis to: 1) recruit a geographically and demographically diverse national sample of same-sex female
couples (N = 300 couples); 2) test a theoretical framework informed by the K99 findings using empirically validated
individual- and couple-level measures; 3) establish her program of research and laboratory; and 4) submit an R01 to
NIH/NIAAA. The proposed study extends findings from Dr. Veldhuis' F32 to understand how individual- and couple-
level characteristics of same-sex relationships influence HD and will provide preliminary data for her R01 application."
10913997,"ABSTRACT
Cellular differentiation, development and homeostasis depend on regulation of gene expression, which is
largely focused on the DNA transcription initiation process. During transcription initiation, Mediator, a large
multi-protein complex conserved throughout eukaryotes, conveys regulatory signals to RNA polymerase II
(RNAPII), the enzyme responsible for transcription of all protein-coding genes. Mediator includes 25-30
different polypeptides (depending on the specific organism) organized into Head, Middle and Tail modules,
plus a dissociable kinase module (CKM) that includes the Cdk8 kinase, the only catalytically-active Mediator
subunit. Mediator conformational rearrangements that stabilize preinitiation complex (PIC) components have
explained the effect of Mediator on basal transcription. However, conformational rearrangements alone are
insufficient to explain the response of Mediator to transcription factors (TFs) that enables transcription
activation and repression. Here we propose biochemical, functional and cryo-EM studies of mammalian
Mediator (mMED) that build on our previous work and explore the significance of mMED’s antagonistic
interaction with the CKM and with MED26, a metazoan-specific, dissociable mMED subunit closely linked to
modulation of mMED–RNAPII interaction. The CKM and MED26 interact with Mediator around a Head-Middle
module interface (the CTD-binding gap) where RNAPII interaction is initiated by binding of the carboxy-
terminal domain of the largest RNAPII subunit (the CTD). CKM-bound (CKM-mMED) and MED26-bound
(MED26-mMED) forms of mMED were independently identified by various research groups shortly after
Mediator’s discovery and we propose to test a mMED activation mechanism based on CKM-mMED to MED26-
mMED interconversion that we hypothesize controls mMED interaction with RNAPII and PIC formation.
In Aim1 we will Investigate the connection between CKM – MED26 antagonism and Mediator activation.
We posit that the crux of the mMED activation mechanism is control of the initial CTD-dependent mMED–
RNAPII interaction by antagonistic effects of the CKM (limits RNAPII interaction) and MED26 (required for
RNAPII interaction) at the CTD-binding gap. We will use in vitro and in vivo approaches including biochemical,
functional and genomic analyses to understand modulation of mMED interaction with RNAPII and its effects on
transcription initiation. These studies will test a proposed activation mechanism that would explain the
significance of mMED subpopulations with opposite functional effects and test whether interconversion
between mMED forms can explain mMED activation.
In Aim 2 we will determine the structural underpinnings that enable regulation of Mediator-RNAPII
interaction. We postulate that TF targeting of CKM-mMED and subsequent effects on MED26 and CTD
interaction at the CTD-binding gap are enabled by mMED structural rearrangements or changes in mMED
conformational dynamics. Structural analysis of well-defined intermediate steps will reveal how mMED’s
structure enables activation. We will use cryo-EM to determine near-atomic resolution maps of various
intermediates and use state-of-the-art image analysis approaches to understand their conformational and
interaction dynamics. These studies will reveal structural factors that underpin primary (initial CTD-dependent
interaction with RNAPII) and subsequent (further modulation of RNAPII interaction and PIC assembly) aspects
of the mMED activation mechanism.
In Aim 3 we will investigate long-range structural rearrangements in mMED that enable mMED activation
by TF binding to Tail module subunits. We believe that changes in the composition, structure or
conformational dynamics of the Tail module triggered by interaction with TFs can be communicated along the
mMED structure to the CTD-binding gap, allowing mMED to respond to a variety of regulatory signals through
the same fundamental activation mechanism. We will use cryo-EM, image analysis and biochemistry to
understand how signals from TF binding to various mMED Tail subunits converge to control interaction of
mMED with RNAPII. The studies described in this aim will test the generality of the proposed mMED activation
mechanism and reveal how the mMED structure can integrate signals from a variety of TFs that target different
mMED subunits.
The studies proposed in this application are both conceptually and technically innovative. We will test a novel
model for regulation of activated transcription initiation based on interconversion between “repressed” and
“activated” forms of mMED by applying a multi-disciplinary approach combining state-of-the-art molecular
biology, genomics, bioinformatics and cryo-EM/image analysis techniques to understand early steps of
mammalian PIC assembly and transcription initiation. We will combine in vitro studies allowing examination of
individual aspects of the proposed mechanism with in vivo studies to verify biological significance and
functional consequences. The use of state-of-the-art cryo-EM and image analysis will allow us to build on prior
accomplishments and arrive at a detailed structural understanding of the way in which the intricate mMED
structure enables activated transcription regulation."
10925629,"Currently, more than 55 million people have dementia worldwide and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) makes up to 30% of all dementia cases. There are no therapies to cure or slow down/stop the progression of LBD, making it a pressing need to develop therapeutics for LBD. The main causal agent in LBD is the aggregation of Alphalpha-synuclein (αS) protein, a neuronal protein that is expressed in neurons. The pathological events in LBD include αS aggregation and the spread of pathogenic αS aggregation via prion-like spread that impairs neuron functions, which leads to LBD phenotypes (cognitive and motor deficits). Therefore, modulation of aggregation and the prion-like spread of αS could be considered a promising therapeutic intervention for LBD. Our lab has synthesized a large library of Oligopyridylamides (OPs) based synthetic protein mimetics with a large chemical diversity. The OPs mimic the topography and side chains of proteins, such as those present at protein aggregation surfaces. We have identified potent OPs that can potently inhibit αS aggregation and LB formation in cellular, neuronal, and C. elegans models. The OP specifically interacts with pathological αS oligomers without displaying any affinity to physiological αS monomers. The OP efficiently crosses the Blood Brain Barrier and inhibits LB formation of LBs in a mouse model without displaying apparent toxicity. Our proposed work is divided into two parts (1) optimization and testing of the pharmaceutical properties of the OPs, (2) testing of OPs to rescue LBD phenotypes in a mouse model. The OPs will be tested for their ADMET properties in human in vitro models. Additionally, based on the chemical structures of OPs, we will design and synthesize OPs to test and optimize the ADMET properties in human in vitro model systems. In tandem, the antagonist activity of the OPs will be tested against αS aggregation in various models. This study will allow the optimization of the pharmaceutical properties of OPs without sacrificing their antagonist activity against pathological LBs. Subsequently, the OP will be tested for their ability to inhibit the LBs in a mouse model. Also, they will be tested to rescue the LBD phenotypes in a mouse model, including the cognitive and motor impairments. The OPs will also be tested for their inherent toxicity in the mouse model via metabolic profiling, where the toxicity of the potential metabolites of OPs will be characterized. Overall, our study will identify potent lead therapeutics for LBD with optimal pharmaceutical and efficacy to rescue LBD phenotypes in the mouse model. In the near future, we expect that the OPs will be ready to be tested for pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology assessments in the animal models to further advance them in the clinical trials for LBD."

 The overarching aim of this research and career development plan is for Dr. Solnick, the Principal Investigator
(PI), to establish herself as an independent physician-investigator whose research focuses on advancing HIV
prevention care for individuals diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in emergency departments
(EDs). EDs have great potential as underutilized allies in the effort to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. EDs especially
could be useful in increasing the initiation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) – a key component of the
National HIV/AIDS Strategy. EDs could be used as an access point where higher HIV-risk individuals, particularly
those with STIs, can be initiated on PrEP and referred for further outpatient maintenance on PrEP.
 Dr. Solnick's K23 research project aims to improve ED-based HIV prevention in STI-diagnosed patients by
developing and evaluating a protocol for Telephone Initiated PrEP Post-ED Discharge (TIPPED). The specific
aims of her K23 research project are to (1) Develop a stakeholder-engaged TIPPED protocol and implementation
strategy; (2) Adapt a tailored counseling message, a Persuasive Health Communication Intervention (PHCI), to
encourage PrEP uptake during post-ED “callback” sessions as conducted by the ED clinician as part of their
regular callback procedure to inform patients of the STI diagnoses; and (3) Implement and evaluate TIPPED,
including a nested pilot randomized controlled trial of PHCI's impact on PrEP initiation and adherence. This
research will incorporate both evaluations of implementation science-focused processes outcomes–feasibility,
fidelity, acceptability–and clinical outcomes of PrEP initiation, linkage to care, and medication adherence.
Advanced statistical methods, such as interrupted time-series methods, will be used to assess clinical outcomes.
 This career development plan will enable Dr. Solnick to build upon her experience as an emergency medicine
physician and healthcare researcher to gain new expertise in (1) Implementation science approaches towards
protocol development, deployment, and analysis; (2) Behavioral interventions in randomized controlled trial
design; and (3) Advanced statistical methods in time-series data from electronic health records. She will receive
in-depth mentorship from a multi-disciplinary research team of experts in the domains of implementation science,
the HIV care continuum, clinical trial design, behavioral interventions, and statistical analysis. The results of this
K23 will guide improvements to TIPPED and form the basis for Dr. Solnick’s subsequent R01 study. Her future
R01 study will evaluate process and clinical outcomes relevant to implementing TIPPED in multiple EDs. The
public health importance of this work is that it will contribute to expanded HIV prevention delivery and improved
outcomes for individuals at risk of HIV infection, namely those with an STI receiving care in the ED."
10924902,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heavy and hazardous alcohol use is inextricably linked to the HIV epidemic in fishing communities on Lake
Victoria in Uganda. Among men living with HIV (LWH) in fishing communities, hazardous alcohol use is
associated with suboptimal antiretroviral (ART) adherence and engagement in HIV care. Fishing communities
are “risk environments'' with limited access to health services and norms reinforcing risky behavior. Contextually
appropriate evidence-based interventions that address these issues in tandem among men LWH in fishing
communities are urgently needed to ensure optimization of treatment as prevention. We developed Kisoboka (“It
is Possible'') a behavioral intervention with a structural element to “reduce cash in the pocket"" otherwise easily
accessible for alcohol purchase. Kisoboka utilizes a behavioral economics (BE) approach and motivational
interviewing (MI) to reduce hazardous drinking and improve ART adherence to achieve undetectable HIV viral
load (VL). In the pilot RCT of the Kisoboka intervention, it demonstrated preliminary efficacy in reducing AUDIT-
C scores and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels among the very hazardously drinking sample and a protective
effect on ART adherence through 6-month follow-up. To inform future scale-up, we propose a factorial RCT
(n=716) to test intervention efficacy and determine if effects are attributable to specific intervention components.
Specific aims are: (1) Determine the efficacy of the Kisoboka intervention and its components among
hazardously drinking men LWH in Uganda in a 2x2 factorial RCT. Arm 1: The Kisoboka intervention (BE+MI);
Arm 2: the behavioral economic component of Kisoboka (BE); Arm 3: the MI-based alcohol reduction and ART
adherence counseling component of Kisoboka (MI); and Arm 4: alcohol screening, referral, and brief intervention.
Primary outcomes assessed at baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up include: PEth (alcohol biomarker), a
combined AUDIT-C score—PEth outcome for hazardous drinking, HIV viral load, and ART adherence via
biomarker. (2) Assess the impact of the Kisoboka intervention and its components on measures of psychological,
physical, and socioeconomic well-being that capture frequent comorbidities of persons LWH and that are
associated with achieving successful treatment as prevention. (3) Guided by the Exploration, Preparation,
Implementation and Sustainment framework, engage key health sector stakeholders to understand barriers and
facilitators in the inner and outer context and assess intervention and implementation costs for implementing
Kisoboka components within the routine clinical setting to inform future widespread implementation. If effective,
Kisoboka, or its components, will be poised for dissemination and scale-up, supporting treatment as prevention
goals among a high-risk population and as one of a limited number of evidence-based HIV alcohol interventions
in this setting."
10924531,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Functional CD4+ T lymphocytes are progressively lost during HIV/Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection
and must be continuously replaced. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are critically important in replenishing T
lymphocytes. However, bone marrow dysplasia and HSC dysfunction have been reported in HIV/SIV infection.
Surprisingly, a detailed understanding of the impact of HSC dysfunction on T cell generation and their
characteristics is elusive. Systematic study of the onset of HSC dysfunction and its impact on immune potential
in humans is hampered by infrequent bone marrow sample availability at desired stages of infection. This is
further complicated by the lack of an in-vivo system to track T-cell generation from bone-marrow-derived HSCs.
Furthermore, a direct viral infection of HSC and distinct thymocyte precursors has been reported. However, these
reports are conflicting and lack robust validation. Consistently, productive infection of thymic precursors and their
potential contribution to the establishment of latent viral reservoirs is ill-defined. These limitations warrant the
development of a system for systematic investigation of HSC dysfunction, its functional consequences on T cell
regenerative potential, and their infection. Encouragingly, recent advancements in the thymic organoid culture
systems have opened novel possibilities for supporting reproducible and efficient ex-vivo T cell generation from
tissue specific-HSCs. This combined with the feasibility of the SIV/NHP model for easy access to the bone
marrow and other significant tissue sources of HSCs at the desired stage of SIV infection has opened
unprecedented opportunities for HIV/SIV research. Therefore, here we propose to exploit a highly efficient,
serum-free, ex-vivo thymic organoid system and utilize the SIV/macaque model of HIV/AIDS to systematically
investigate the impact of HSC dysfunction on distinct thymocyte population characteristics and their infection. In
this direction, we have successfully established a novel ex-vivo nonhuman primate artificial thymic organoid
(nhpATO) model supporting efficient T cell positive selection via established early T cell thymocyte precursor
intermediates. Using these systems, we will first perform an in-depth investigation into the HSC dysfunction and
its impact on distinct thymocyte population characteristics (Aim 1). In this direction, we will define the stage of
the onset of HSC dysfunction, its impact on the kinetics of distinct thymocyte generation, and its impact on other
key properties such as TCR-dependent function. Next, we will investigate the host and viral determinants of HSC
dysfunction and transcriptional regulation promoting thymopoiesis (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the SIV
infection of thymic precursors and its potential to establish latent viral reservoirs (Aim 3). Thus, the SIV/NHP
model combined with the nhpATO system offers unique opportunities to address key questions and fill critical
knowledge gaps likely opening novel avenues for future HIV cure efforts using the SIV/NHP model. Moreover,
the novel thymic organoid platform of SIV infection established here will have important implications for screening
anti-viral therapeutics. The data generated from this study will significantly contribute to future NIH R01 grants."
10923300,"Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses HIV replication, but 30-60% of infected patients suffer from
severe HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). However, the mechanisms underlying HAND are
unclear and this lack of information has prevented the development of effective science-driven treatments. Our
data have provided key information connecting etiology, especially by showing that pathogenic contents of
plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) from either chronic SHIV-infected and cART treated rhesus macaque (RM)
or HIV(+)–cART treated patients play a key role in the development and progression of HAND. Moreover, our
novel findings provide the first evidence that EVs released by HIV-replication defective cells (HIV-EVs) cause
dysfunction and damage to the primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and disrupt
blood-brain barrier (BBB) function via a mitochondrial-dependent mechanism. These results are consistent with
our non-human primates and mice studies, which shown that brain microvessels (MVs: end arterioles, capillaries,
and venules) composed primarily of endothelial cells, are more vulnerable due to SIV-infection and exposure to
HIV-EVs, respectively. Additionally, our data suggest that neuroinflammatory protein fibrinogen (Fgn) and HIV-
Tat are abundant in HIV-associated EVs, which impairs mitochondrial function and ATP production in BMECs
by preventing normal mitochondrial fission/fusion events via direct inhibition of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1),
thereby reducing energy production and increasing oxidative stress. These detrimental mitochondrial effects
lead to endothelial cell damage, disruption of the BBB, impaired blood flow regulation, and cognitive impairment.
Interestingly, we observed that EVs released by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) rescued the HIV-EV/Fgn-
mediated mitochondrial dysregulation and BBB leakage in HBMECs. Our focus on cerebral MVs is appropriate
since this segment of the circulation is increasingly recognized as an initiation site for the progression of many
neurological diseases, including HAND. Our overall hypothesis is that HIV verion free EVs accelerate cerebral
microvascular endothelial and BBB dysfunction by inducing mitochondrial dysregulation. Moreover, we propose
that MSC-EVs could protect endothelial mitochondria in live mice. We will explore EV-mediated BMEC/BBB
dysregulation in cerebral MVs of humanized NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice. In Aim 1, we will determine the
effects of HIV-free EVs on mitochondrial and BBB dysfunction in brain microvasculature of NSG mice. In Aim 2,
we will establish the EV-containing fibrinogen and HIV-Tat dependent mechanism for mitochondrial and BBB
dysregulation in cerebral MVs of NSG mice. In Aim 3, we will establish the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs to
reverse the EV-mediated mitochondrial and BBB dysfunction in cerebral MVs of NSG mice. Vascular
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are an integral part of HAND. The NIH has designated
VCID as a critical research area and our application is highly relevant for this research area.

10923542,"Chronic disability following stroke is a significant problem for Veterans affecting a variety of daily activities. One
area of importance is the impact of stroke on driving safety. With technology for fully autonomous driving vehicles
still decades away from implementation, it is critical that we ensure a safe return to driving in our Veterans
following brain injury. Evaluation of Veterans’ driving skills in a driving simulator is a safe and low-cost procedure
that has been shown to correlate highly with on-road testing. In our prior Merit project, we have established that
stroke patients with a wide range of deficits can successfully complete simulated driving assessments and we
have shown that brain injuries involving the left versus right cerebral hemisphere result in very different patterns
of driving errors (e.g., lane deviations, collisions, and speeding). We also found that measures of executive
functioning and visuospatial abilities are more predictive of driving performance than other factors such as age,
visual acuity, and simple reaction time. Our data thus far suggest a need for driving evaluations that can target
specific driving skills related to specific cognitive abilities, a key step towards the goal of precision-medicine at
the VA, which strives to tailor care and treatment to the specific needs of individual patients.
The current project will address this need by evaluating stroke patients on a state-of-the-art driving simulator in
which specific driving skills (lane positioning, speed management, and accident avoidance) will be individually
assessed in separate driving modules. These specific driving skills will be related to performance on cognitive
tasks in order to identify which cognitive functions are consistently associated with specific aspects of driving. In
addition, we will examine whether several common driver-assist features (e.g., lane departure and collision
warnings) are helpful or harmful to individuals recovering from stroke. Lastly, we will investigate the neural
correlates of specific driving skills using lesion symptom mapping techniques, which relate specific brain regions
to behavioral performance. Participants will include 40 left and 40 right hemisphere Veteran stroke patients with
no prior neurologic or severe psychiatric history, and 20 age- and education-matched Veterans with no
neurologic or psychiatric history (controls). We will use a state-of-the-art driving simulator that has been
demonstrated to have strong ecological and predictive validity with respect to on-road driving fitness. It is
predicted that left hemisphere stroke patients will exhibit greater impairment in speed control and that
performance on this skill will correlate with attentional monitoring capacity and executive functioning measures
(e.g., Trailmaking). Right hemisphere stroke patients, in contrast, are predicted to have greater difficulty with
lane positioning and collision avoidance, which is expected to correlate with visuospatial attention bias and
spatial working memory capacity. It is further expected that Veterans with posterior right hemisphere strokes will
benefit from driver assist warning signals that help “direct” their attention, while these same signals are expected
to be detrimental to left hemisphere patients with decreased executive functioning and limited attentional
resources. With respect to lesion site, it is predicted that specific driving skills related to visuospatial attention,
such as lane positioning, will be associated with lesions in dorsal fronto-parietal cortex, whereas driving skills
requiring sustained visual monitoring, such as speed management, will be associated with lesions to a ventral
network in left inferior frontal and temporal cortex.
The proposed study will advance the field by identifying neuropsychological measures and biomarkers that can
be used clinically as a preliminary screen to identify driving vulnerabilities. It is our goal that this study will also
be a first step toward the development of individualized driver training programs at VA that can be implemented
in a safe and low-cost simulated driving environment to assist brain injured Veterans safely return to driving."

Despite extensive research and medical expenditures, cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause
of mortality and morbidity in the modern world. Among animal models used in cardiovascular research, zebrafish
(Dario rerio) has been proven to be the premier model for studies of developmental genetics and functional
genomics owing to their conserved genome, small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, and
optical transparency, just to name a few. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal
the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Zebrafish cardiac
physiology shows similar phenotypes to humans and the time-lapse videos of the heart development can be
easily acquired. All these make zebrafish an ideal choice to investigate cardiac development, congenital heart
disease as well as therapeutic potentials.
The embryonic zebrafish (up to ~3 days) are transparent with decent internal organs visibility, including the heart
and the vascular system. Thus, bright field microscopic videos can quantify cardiac mechanism and morphology
at this stage. Conventionally, researchers have to label the ventricle manually, find the End Systolic (ES) and
End Diastolic (ED) frames, and then derive the desired parameters, such as ejection fraction (EF) and heart rate
(HR). This is tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate.
In this context, we aim to develop a Zebrafish Automatic Cardiovascular Assessment System (ZACAS) with
housing chambers, camera chipsets and electronics to give a fast, economic, hassle-free and easy solution for
researchers to assess cardiac functions of developing zebrafish embryos. Specifically, we will i) Develop a novel
apparatus to house and assess developing zebrafish embryos; and ii) Improve our existing framework to work
with real-time videos and ECG taken from the apparatus. The developed system could be an invaluable asset
for thousands of research laboratories worldwide as well as company working on drug screening."

Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an area of highest priority and an unmet need
for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with germline
mutations, mucinous pancreatic cysts and new-onset diabetes (NOD) are at higher than average risk for PDAC.
In the immediate prior cycle, our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC): (a) facilitated the conduct of the first ever, multi-institutional, blinded “biomarker bakeoff” in PDAC by
providing annotated biospecimens, (b) completed one of the first EDRN-defined Phase 3 biomarker studies in
PDAC using pre-diagnostic samples (Fahrmann et al, Gastroenterology 2021), and (c) served as a conduit for
the implementation of additional EDRN collaborative research initiatives, including a pre-diagnostic PDAC
imaging consortium. Our renewal application represents a Gulf Coast-Great Lakes EDRN Clinical Validation
Center (GCGLEC) in Pancreatic Cancer is comprised of UTMDACC/Lyndon B Johnson Hospital (Harris Health,
TX), Henry Ford Health System (HFHS, Detroit, MI) and Ochsner Health System (OHS, New Orleans, LA) and
has three major objectives: First, to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality
biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies (including early stage PDAC,
pancreatic cystic lesions, and other benign pancreatic diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, and
endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection
of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Current PDAC biomarker studies
typically have sparse representation from racial and ethnic minorities, and therefore a major impetus of the
GCGLEC will be to address the “disparity gap” in biomarker research by obtaining biospecimens from
underrepresented minorities. Second, the GCGLEC will build upon our published Phase 3 study utilizing the
“anchor panel” of CA19-9, LRG1 and TIMP-1, by conducting four additional PRoBE-compliant studies that
incorporate autoantibodies, metabolites and additional protein biomarkers for improving the sensitivity of
diagnosing asymptomatic PDAC without compromising the 99% or greater specificity threshold. These EDRN-
defined Phase 3 studies will be conducted in pre-diagnostic cases and controls obtained from existing cohorts,
including the PLCO, WHI, and the so-called “Harvard cohorts” (NHS, PHS, WHS and HPFS), as well as ongoing
prospective cohorts undergoing accrual, such as the NCI-funded New Onset Hyperglcyemia and Diabetes (NOD)
cohort, and the Early detection Initiation (EDI) in PDAC, a collaboration between PanCAN and the NCI. Third,
the GCGLEC will serve as a “hub” for collaborative activities within and outside the EDRN, including
collaborations with investigators funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC), and laying the
foundations for conducting an EDRN-approved multi-institutional “clinical utility” (Phase 4 study) for PDAC early

miRNA regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin triggers BK channel alcohol tolerance and
facilitated consumption
Research has identified the large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated channel (BK) as
a key regulator of neuronal excitability genetically associated to behavioral alcohol tolerance in
invertebrates. Similarly in mammals, decreasing BK channel alcohol sensitivity by knocking out
its ß4 subunit leads to increased alcohol voluntary consumption in mice. Sensitivity to ethanol at
the molecular level is characterized by acute potentiation of channel activity. However, different
isoforms of the BK channel show variations in alcohol sensitivity and are differentially distributed
on the plasma membrane surface in response to prolonged exposure, also known as persistent
alcohol tolerance (PMT). miRNA targeting of alcohol-sensitive isoforms coupled with active
internalization of BK channels in response to ethanol are believed to be key in establishing
homeostatic adaptations that produce persistent changes within the striatum. These
mechanisms may operate independently, with the same end point of increasing the
representation of alcohol insensitive BK channels or interact to orchestrate and optimize these
persistent adaptive changes at the translational and trafficking level of regulation.
Results from our current project have identified the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a key
regulator of BK channel surface redistribution in response to 6hr ethanol exposure. We have
characterized this as a form of long-term neuronal plasticity, which requires protein synthesis
resulting in increased ß-catenin expression and persistence, past 24hr withdrawal. Activation of
ß-catenin signaling has been linked to miR-9 upregulation in human cancer cells, as well as,
miRNA expression in depression-resilient mice. Notably, miR-9 upregulated expression in the
striatum is a key event in PMT mediating acute EtOH desensitization of BK channels. Thus, the
overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that a single “binge-like” 6hr exposure persistently
alters BK channel surface distribution within the NAc via miRNA regulated Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, impacting subsequent alcohol consumption. We will use electrophysiology, molecular
biology, behavioral assays and imaging techniques to determine the role of Wnt/ß-catenin
signaling in both BK trafficking and miRNA regulation within the striatum with the goal of
identifying novel therapeutic targets involved in preventing the transition from initial to
compulsive drinking behavior."

The proposed project focuses on creating an active assistance arm-support exoskeleton to reduce work-
related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) in careers requiring manual labor. Significance: WRMSDs are
highly prevalent and costly in industrialized countries, causing the sufferers significant personal, social, and
economic pain. The majority of these ailments occur in the upper body (arms, back and neck regions). The
main objective of industrial exoskeletons is to aid workers by reducing the physical fatigue, discomfort, and
overuse injuries caused by performing repetitive overhead and lifting motions. The current generation of
passive industrial, upper-body exoskeleton store energy mechanically by loading a spring during the arm
descending phase. This action impedes the user's normal motion and shifts energy expenditure rather than
supplement it. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the creation of an intelligent, active exoskeleton can eliminate

10920027,"Project Summary/Abstract
Introduction. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 million Americans
and 10 million individuals worldwide. One of the most debilitating and impactful symptoms of PD is Freezing
of Gait (FOG). FOG, defined as an episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet
despite the intention to walk, is a common motor symptom of PD. FOG is a “mysterious phenomenon” with
a pathophysiology that is not fully understood. FOG decreases quality of life and activity level, and leads
to loss of independence and injurious falls. Surgical and pharmacological treatments are often ineffective in
reducing FOG; however, alternate interventions can be more efficacious. External prompts, such as auditory,
visual, or tactile cues, have been shown to help, but outcomes are mixed due to the individualized nature of
FOG—different cues are more or less effective depending on the individual and their present circumstances.
The ParkinSense System. The body-worn ParkinSense system will help PD patients prevent FOG and resume
ambulation when FOG occurs. The miniature, wireless ParkinSense instrument will be easily attachable to
existing prescription or nonprescription eyeglasses, or can be worn as a low-profile band under a cap or hat. Using
sophisticated on-board six degrees-of-freedom inertial sensing and online processing algorithms, the ParkinSense
system will automatically detect FOG and provide an individually calibrated and optimized combination of cues,
including: auditory (speech, music, or rhythmic beats), visual (transverse lines or a grid in the visual field),
and/or vibrotactile cues. The ParkinSense system also includes a limb-worn unit to perform supplemental
sensing and cueing directly to a leg. The ParkinSense system will enable delivery of multiple types of cues
alone or in any combination. Cueing can be provided automatically in response to a FOG event, manually
(controlled by the wearer), or continuously. Cue delivery (for example, the amplitude and frequency of the
tactile cues) can be optimized to provide maximum efficacy, unobtrusiveness, and comfort for individual users.
Further, the ParkinSense system will have the capability to adapt its cues; for instance, the cue rhythm can
match the functional step cadence of the wearer in order to maximize response. The ParkinSense system will
track FOG occurrence over time and the efficacy of each provided cue. These data will be used to further and
continuously personalize the system for each user; ParkinSense will become more effective for an individual as
it is used. Finally, ParkinSense will have a remote reporting capability that will allow clinicians to monitor their
patients health status over time (e.g., activity level, FOG occurrence, and adherence to device use).
Phase I Results. A ParkinSense prototype was designed, built, and evaluated by collecting data on patients
with PD using a FOG-inducing protocol. The ParkinSense system algorithms were shown to detect FOG with
high accuracy. A mixed-methods formative user-acceptance study demonstrated high acceptance, usability, and
enthusiasm for the ParkinSense system. All Phase I objectives were achieved."

Currently, stroke diagnosis requires advanced imaging (e.g., CT, MRI) to distinguish stroke from mimics, which
affect up to 58% of individuals presenting with clinical stroke symptoms. Lack of prompt diagnosis for ischemic
stroke, as well as exclusion criteria that stem from potentially severe risk factors associated with global tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, resulted in less than 4% of U.S. patients receiving thrombolytic
therapy. CT is typically used to rule out presence of a large hemorrhage or bleeding (10-15% of cases) yet
frequently cannot be performed in time for effective thrombolysis. Furthermore, while cerebral blood flow (CBF)
perfusion is a direct target parameter for management during acute initial intervention and throughout recovery
(12-72 hours post treatment), current hardware is either ‘snapshot’ (perfusion CT and ASL-MRI), or highly
invasive (EVD probes). As a result, neuro-intensivists are often left assessing brain perfusion indirectly using
systemic targets such as cerebral perfusion pressure. There is no currently available clinically effective
method to directly measure CBF rapidly, continuously, quantitatively, and non-invasively. Optical methods
hold promise for continuous assessment of CBF. However, absolute quantification of CBF has remained a
challenge, requiring high brain specificity in addition to time-of-flight information, which enables accounting for
head anatomy and optical properties. While interferometric Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (iNIRS), developed by
our team, has addressed the challenge of quantification by providing the time-of-flight dimension, it suffers from
low photon collection of a single mode fiber, requiring temporal averaging of 10 seconds or longer. On the other
hand, multi-speckle approaches demonstrated recently have unprecedented light collection efficiency but to date
do not provide absolute quantification of blood flow. A high throughput version of iNIRS is therefore required to
obtain rapid and accurate CBF data non-invasively in the adult human brain. To address this critical need,
Neuralenz is developing Neuralenz Flow: an integrated platform permitting rapid, non-invasive, real-time
measurement of critical factors used to diagnose and treat stroke patients, including CBF, cerebral blood
volume, intracranial pressure, and critical closing pressure. In this Phase 1 proposal we will further develop
a multi-channel long-wavelength (1064 nm) iNIRS technique with magnetic resonance compatible front-end
probe for achieving more than two orders of magnitude higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to our prior state-
of-the-art device. We will then comprehensively validate our measurements against gold-standard MR
technologies. The outcome of this Phase I study will result in a minimum viable product validated in healthy
human subjects capable of real-time measurement of CBF. This technology will have a significant clinical impact
on continuous monitoring of neurocritical care patients and in point-of-care diagnosis and treatment of potentially
deadly diseases such as stroke and traumatic brain injury."
10921969,"Project Summary
There are 300,000 vitreo-retinal procedures performed in the US each year, with the goal of restoring vision
lost from a myriad of retinal diseases including retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, endophthalmitis, pro-
liferative diabetic retinopathy, and ocular trauma. The traditional surgical approach uses a top-down widefield
viewing system thru the cornea and lens to be able to visualize the retina sufficiently to perform necessary fine
tissue manipulation. Difficulty arises when this view is compromised due to corneal and lenticular opacifica-
tion, which may precede any surgical intervention or arise during the attempted surgical repair itself. Up to 30%
of surgeries encounter a compromised surgical view and this directly corresponds to the complexity of the reti-
nal pathology and depth of visual loss from retinal disease.
For the last 30 years ophthalmic endoscopy has been available to bypass an obscured anterior segment view,
but despite this it remains poorly utilized. Key reasons for low adoption rates of this technology all stem from
the non-intuitive view the endoscope probe provides: skewed perspective, flat 2-D image, reduced field of
view, difficulty maintaining probe orientation in the eye, and lack of correspondence between surgeon instru-
ment hand movement and what is seen on screen. The image is also provided on a separate screen to the
side of the surgical field, and the constant need to hold the probe removes the capability of bi-manual surgery.
To overcome these hurdles RetiVue L.L.C. proposes to develop the EntireEyeScope, the first 3-D stereo endo-
scopic viewing system to provide a traditional heads-up, top-down view of the retina as if one is looking thru a
clear cornea and lens. This will be accomplished by insertion of two miniature camera modules through 20G
sclerotomies, enabling 4X the resolution of current fiber optic based ophthalmic endoscopes. Advanced image
processing will transform the video stream from both cameras real-time into a standard 3-D, always in focus
top-down view for the surgeon as if they were visualizing the retina thru a clear cornea and lens. This view will
be compatible with a VR headset or feed into the surgical microscope directly.
An endoscopic approach that closely recapitulates the traditional surgeon view should facilitate a greater rate
of adoption of this technology, and allows for precision manipulation of retinal tissue not available in commer-
cially available devices to date. Ultimately, this device will help improve surgical outcomes for patients, leading
to greater recovery of vision."
10922509,"ABSTRACT
Although opioids are effective in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, they are addictive and have
dangerous side-effects, including respiratory depression, constipation, sedation, nausea and dizziness. Even
when used in acute pain, up to 10% of patients become persistent users, and unused opioid tablets fuel misuse
by the patient’s friends and family. Clearly, there is a need for new therapeutics that provide effective pain relief
without these dangerous side-effects and risks of addiction and abuse. All opioid receptors belong to the family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous
systems. The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is recognized as the dominant receptor for pain-relieving effects –
Powerful analgesics such as morphine and codeine are agonists of the MOR. The major drawback of targeting
the MOR for clinical analgesia is that it is also responsible for the undesirable central side effects. In fact,
avoidance of central targeting using peripheral activators of MOR, showed efficacy in pain reduction with
decreased side-effects. However, the potential for abuse and toxicity has limited therapeutic development.
Abalone Bio proposes to develop a peripheral antibody agonist of MOR with reduced side effects utilizing its
Functional Antibody Selection Technology (FAST) platform, which is a high-throughput, cell-based platform for
directly identifying functional antibody candidates that modulate GPCR activity. Since antibodies do not readily
cross the blood-brain barrier, these antibody agonists of MOR inherently would be peripheral activators of MOR.
Moreover, the long half-life of antibodies would allow infrequent outpatient administration, limiting abuse
potential. Furthermore, MOR agonists with G-protein signaling bias have the potential to retain analgesic effect,
while reducing additional side-effects such as tolerance. For this reason, Abalone Bio will evaluate G-protein vs.
β-arrestin bias for candidate antibodies and prioritize antibodies with bias toward G-protein signaling.
Peripherally restricted and biased MOR antibody agonists are expected to deliver on the promise of previously
failed attempts to eliminate the unwanted and dangerous side effects associated with MOR’s analgesic qualities.
The specific aims for this Phase I project will be to identify agonist MOR antibodies utilizing Abalone Bio’s FAST
platform (Aim 1). Stable cell lines that over-express human, mouse and cyno MOR will be created. Using these
cell lines, we will validate two functional assays to characterize the MOR agonist antibodies (Aim 2). MOR agonist
antibodies will be cloned, expressed and characterized for expression levels, stability, specificity, as well as
function in the two in vitro assays developed above (Aim 3). Finally, we will assess the ability of the antibodies
to reduce inflammatory nociception using an in vivo mouse model (Aim 4)."

Cloud/Subscription based, Customer-Responsive Dosimetry Tool for α-Particle Emitters
PROJECT SUMMARY
Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – defined as a form of cancer therapy that uses targeted radionuclides to
deliver radiation to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a growing area with many pharmaceutical
companies developing products in this area. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a
key requirement for regulatory approval and treatment planning. Currently available dosimetry software
packages were developed for diagnostic imaging or therapies involving beta emitters applications. These do not
include features essential for α-emitter radiopharmaceutical therapy (αRPT). In this Phase II application, we will
build upon our previous work to transition from a radiological protection-based dosimetry paradigm, where the
biologic endpoint is long-term stochastic effects, to one whose endpoint is normal tissue toxicity and therapeutic
efficacy. We will implement a methodology that uses macroscopic activity measurements to derive activity
distributions at the microscopic level (we call it macro-to-micro or M2µ). Because of the short range and high
potency of α-particles, and the inability to assess microscale activity distributions directly in human patients with
current imaging technology, the M2µ formalism is essential to assessing normal organ toxicity for αRPT. The
M2µ methodology was developed at Johns Hopkins and licensed to Rapid®, LLC. No other dosimetry product
has implemented the M2µ technology. The work proposed in this Phase II application will be incorporated into
3D-RD-S, our cloud-based Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee S-value-compatible dose
calculation tool. Based on clients’ requests, this area has been identified as the area of greatest need. The
specific aims for this application are: 1. Establish a library of microscale S-values for three dose-limiting tissues
relevant to αRPT (kidneys, bone marrow, salivary glands). 2. Establish corresponding apportionment factors that
map whole-organ activity concentration to sub-structure activity concentrations 3. Implement customizable M2µ
dosimetry by allowing user uploads of a microscale geometry for a given macroscopically defined tissue. 4.
Integrate, and computationally test, the M2µ functionality within the 3D-RD-S platform; using the already built-in
uncertainty calculation platform, calculate the uncertainty associated with microscale absorbed doses. 5. Since
α-emitter dosimetry and the M2µ method are likely to be unfamiliar to users that are new to αRPT, we will develop
on-line educational materials accessible within the 3D-RD-S platform. Aim 5 reflects the importance of educating
both αRPT practitioners and the regulatory authorities regarding the special considerations related to α-emitter
dosimetry. The on-line material builds on the 3D-RD-S cloud-based platform. Support for this grant will complete
a component of a multi-component subscription-based and browser-accessible dosimetry platform for αRPT that
will eventually include all of the essential elements needed to support treatment planning of cancer patients
undergoing α-emitter radiopharmaceutical therapy."
10920466,"Single-use disposable lancets are indispensable components of a self-monitoring of blood glucose
(SMBG) system. However, tens of billions of lancets are disposed of unsafely every year, contributing to
sharps injuries among caregivers, household members, sanitation workers, and community members. Despite
educational and safety awareness campaigns, the inconvenience and expense make improper disposal an
ongoing problem around the world. Used lancets also contribute some 12,000 metric tons of single-use plastic
to the environment annually.
 Hemingway Designs is developing an innovative “green lancet” that incorporates novel use of materials
to solve both the sharps problem and the plastic waste problem. The green lancet incorporates a needle made
of magnesium alloy (MgA). The base and cap is made of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). MgAs are lightweight,
strong, biocompatible metals dissolvable in household white vinegar. After using the green lancet, it is placed
in a small amount of vinegar which dissolves the needle in minutes. The PHA base is retrieved and along with
cap is home composted or placed in the trash where it will readily biodegrade in a landfill.
 The green lancet meets the inclusion criteria for the NIDDK’s SBIR Research Topic 1.E. “Technologies
that may promote and facilitate adherence/compliance by users of diabetes monitoring and control devices.”
The green lancet was accepted into the FDA’s Safer Technology Program (STeP) on August 23, 2023. The
specific aims of the Phase 1 SBIR are:
 SA1: Establish the feasibility of fabricating lancet needles from MgA. Candidate MgAs will be
evaluated for dimensionality, mechanical properties, machinability, corrosion, and biocompatibility.
Nanostructuring techniques to improve mechanical properties and machinability will be evaluated. The
required polishing and tip grinding processes will be characterized.
 SA2: Establish the feasibility of constructing lancet bases and caps from PHA or other
biodegradable bioplastic. Candidate PHA formulations will be evaluated for moldability. Strength and
flexibility will be evaluated following gamma sterilization and preconditioning.
 SA3: Verify the performance of the materials in a prototype lancet. The prototype lancet
performance will be verified in nonclinical simulated use testing, dissolution testing, and compostability testing.
 A successful outcome of the proposal will be a product design specification that will initiate a medical
device product development effort following ISO 13485 in preparation for a 510(k) submission to the FDA. The
product development effort, including nonclinical and clinical testing will be the subject of a future Phase II
submission."

The overarching goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to elucidate mechanisms of cardiotoxicity
and to develop a platform to test cardiotoxicity of new cancer therapeutics. Project 1 (Moslehi) will use
a combination of mouse- and cell-based models to address the central question of whether
cardiotoxicity associated with ibrutinib is on- or off-target. Project 2 (Wu) will establish novel pooled
“cell villages” from patients to map genetic inter-individual difference in response to kinase inhibitors to
elucidate genetic susceptibility to cardiotoxicity from kinase inhibitors. Project 3 (Mercola) aims to
identify mechanisms that protect against cardiotoxicity of ibrutinib using a pipeline for discovery of
protective targets based on reverting epigenomic consequences of exposure to a toxic drug. All three
projects will be supported by an iPSC Processing Core (Core B) (Sallam) that will facilitate a unique
repository of iPSC lines from patients with ibrutinib treatment. An Administrative Core (Wu) will
support all three projects and the core to facilitate a fully integrated program project and enable high-
impact research. The proposed PPG and assembled group collectively introduces synergies that will
significantly impact the field of cardio-oncology and make translationally actionable inroads to decrease
the burden of adverse effects of cancer therapeutics."

These are all injected vaccines and no mucosal saponin adjuvant currently exists. LT(R192G/L211A), or dmLT, is the product of more than 35 years of research on the use of bacterial ADP-ribosylating enterotoxins as adjuvants. dmLT has recently had success in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for ETEC and polio virus, though success for oral delivery seems to be dependent upon the immunogenicity of the antigen. Both adjuvants are pursued independently for various vaccines and delivery routes but have not been pursued together. In preliminary studies, we have observed synergistic adjuvant activity when dmLT and saponins are co-administered by oral and sublingual vaccination. In the current project, we propose to evaluate the novel combination saponin dmLT adjuvant (SDA) for oral or sublingual delivery utilizing expertise by both Tulane, Q-Vant Biosciences and PATH. We will optimize SDA in globally relevant vaccines including the U.S. Navy’s adjuvanted subunit ETEC and Campylobacter vaccine (ASEC) targeting bacterial enteric infections and inactivated polio vaccine. We will also explore novel formation preparations specific to gastrointestinal delivery and conduct IND-enabling studies such as GLP and cGMP manufacturing, toxicology, and stability testing. The ultimate goal of these studies is to define the SDA adjuvant platform and formulation that provides potent systemic immunity and/or sustained mucosal immunity."
10921940,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brooklyn InnoSeq (doing business as MaMome) is developing a microbial screening test for the early detection
of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. GDM is defined as
diabetes diagnosed within the mother in the second or third trimester of pregnancy provided that overt diabetes
early in pregnancy has been excluded [1]. GDM is the most common medical complication and metabolic
disorder of pregnancy with a reported incidence of 18% among pregnant women worldwide [1-4]. The risk of
gestational diabetes increases with each pregnancy. The current diagnosis standard for GDM is a 2-step Oral
Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) administered between weeks 24-28 of gestation [5]. However, the OGTT
methodology is a diagnostic tool for GDM and not a tool for the prevention of this disease. Currently, there are
no effective clinical tools to accurately predict GDM or to detect latent Type II diabetes in early pregnancy as
many women do not receive screenings before they are pregnant [6]. One of our primary innovations has been
in the identification of microbial biomarkers associated with GDM in earlier pregnancies through microbiome
profiling and machine learning technologies. These biomarkers will provide the basis for developing a clinically
viable non-invasive microbiome screening test to predict GDM development significantly earlier than the
current OGTT method. The sampling procedure of our screening test does not require any significantly
invasive measures, extending its utilization not just in hospitals with healthcare providers, but also to the home
via a user-friendly sampling kit. With this approach, we can initiate the appropriate interventions and
therapeutics to prevent GDM and subsequent associated complications. Our previous study, consisting of 66
pregnant women, has identified 5 bacteria in the first trimester that are predictive of GDM. Our Phase I project
aims to validate these biomarkers with an independent cohort and to refine machine learning approaches
based on a newly enrolled cohort. In aim 1, we will prospectively enroll 250 pregnant women, collecting stool
samples at the first trimester and at the OGTT diagnosis window. This will be followed by metagenomic whole
genome shotgun sequencing (mWGS) to identify microbiome species and (or) microbiome genes that are
associated with GDM. In aim 2, we will develop a predictive model for GDM using machine learning
approaches. Our ultimate goal is to create a predictive microbiome screening test to detect GDM within
Trimester 1. With approximately 4.6 million annual births in the United States [7], patients and physicians
would benefit greatly from more accurate, non-invasive tests at home before GDM is established. We will first
target OB/GYNs to use our screening test, focusing on developing relationships in the East Coast US markets
as well as partnering with global distributors to enter a larger market."
10921955,"Autoantibody-associated autoimmune diseases (AAADs) are disorders in which dysfunctional plasma cells
(PCs) secrete autoantibodies that attack healthy tissue. Many AAADs attack the nervous system, such as
myasthenia gravis (MG), neuromyelitis optica, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Lambert-
Eaton syndrome, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. This R44 (Clinical Trial Not Allowed) will support
manufacturing of a new RNA-based cell therapy for neurological AAADs, and analysis of biomarkers from
patients who received the therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy eliminates pathogenic
cells, such as PCs, by expressing engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) in T cells isolated from a
patient; the T cells are then reinfused to kill the CAR’s target. All approved CAR T drugs rely on gene transfer
by DNA, which permanently modifies the genome. This poses several problems. DNA-modified CAR-T cells
multiply exponentially because CAR DNA replicates; this can cause life-threatening inflammation called
cytokine release syndrome (CRS). These CAR-T cells also require pre-treatment chemotherapy to create a
niche for cell proliferation. DNA-modified CAR-T cells are expensive to make and use clinically, because
frequent adverse events require close patient monitoring. These hurdles have limited CAR-T therapy only to
advanced cancers. Cartesian Therapeutics has designed a new approach that replaces DNA with RNA to
achieve transient, tunable CAR expression (rCAR-T). Unlike DNA-modified CAR T cells, CAR-encoding RNA
cannot replicate and decays in predictable fashion. Thus, the patient’s exposure to rCAR-T cells is determined
by cell dose. This avoids CRS and eliminates lymphodepleting chemotherapy. These advances create a
versatile, clinically-validated means to treat neurological AAADs. We have developed an rCAR-T that targets
B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). This marker is expressed on PCs – cells that produce autoantibodies in
AAADs. This therapy – “Descartes-08” – transiently expresses anti-BCMA CAR to target BCMA+ PCs after
infusion. MG is an AAAD in which BCMA+ PCs secrete autoantibodies that attack the neuromuscular junction,
causing severe muscle weakness. In the first successful Phase 2a trial of a cell therapy to treat autoimmunity
(NCT04146051), Descartes-08 conferred potent, safe, and long-lasting improvement in MG patients for 12
months or more, even though treatment was only 6-weeks (Lancet Neurology 2023). These benefits were
achieved without the toxicity, inpatient stays, or lymphodepletion needed in DNA-based CAR-Ts. Here we
propose key steps to develop rCAR-T as a new cell therapy option to treat neurological AAADs. The aims
are i) manufacture Descartes-08 product lots to complete the Phase 2 MG clinical trial, ii) Identify clinical
correlates in patient samples from ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) and iii) manufacture
Descartes-08 lots for expanded access and basket trial patients with other neurological AAADs. Completing
these aims will position Descartes-08 to become the first commercial rCAR-T product for a variety of AAADs."

Indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs), including peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) as well
as implantable venous access ports, are commonly used for drug treatments or supportive care in a variety of
disease conditions; however, central lines carry a risk of complications, including catheter-related infections
and catheter-related thrombosis (CRT). Several risk factors can contribute to CRT including underlying
diseases, many of which are conditions in which CVC placement is critical to patient care. For example,
cytotoxic chemotherapy to treat cancer can create a hypercoagulable state that increases CRT risk. While both
cancer and cancer directed therapy impart thrombotic risk, some also increase the risk of bleeding, including
myelotoxic drugs. At present, antithrombotic drugs are not used for CRT prevention in cancer patients due to
hemostatic impairment concerns and lack of efficacy data. Since CRT can have localized (device failure) or
secondary (vessel occlusion, embolization) complications, an important unmet need exists for safe and
effective CRT prevention in patients who need CVC placement. This SBIR Fast Track project directly
addresses this critical need by developing a unique contact activation targeting antithrombotic and
antiinflammatory agent, AB023 (gruticibart), to prevent CRT. We have recently conducted a small investigator-
initiated phase 2 clinical study in cancer patients with CVCs to evaluate whether this approach may be safe
and effective (NCT04465760). In this exploratory study, we found only 1 in 8 (12.5%) patients developed early
CRT detected via ultrasound after AB023 administration. In a parallel observational study, we found that 4 in
10 (40%) cancer patients with a CVC had early CRT detected via ultrasound. Our early clinical safety data
from this trial and from another trial in end stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (NCT03612856)
suggests that AB023 is safe in medically complex patient populations, with no drug-related adverse events
observed in 42 treated individuals. During this Phase I/II SBIR project, we propose to conduct a powered,
randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety of CRT prevention in cancer
patients who otherwise would not receive thromboprophylaxis. AB023 specifically targets prothrombotic
coagulation factor XI (FXI) activation by factor XII (FXII), without inhibiting hemostatic feedback activation of
FXI by thrombin. Therefore, AB023 is unique and has the potential to be exceptionally safe among other
investigational FXI/FXIa targeting drugs in development. However, it is not yet entirely certain that blocking the
FXI/FXII interaction has no unforeseen adverse effects on hemostasis. Therefore, as a long-term development
strategy, we will also determine the potential utility of several drug reversal approaches to terminate the
anticoagulant activity of AB023. Achievement of our critical milestones include: Aim 1- Identify one effective
reversal or bypass agent for AB023, and Aim 2- Demonstrate that a single dose of AB023 is safe and reduces
early CRT when administered to cancer patients at the time of CVC placement. Success of the proposed
research will prompt subsequent definitive trials of AB023 to safely prevent CRT."
10921675,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dolutegravir is widely used for HIV treatment globally, yet glaringly little data on integrase resistance after
dolutegravir failure among children are available. While dolutegravir is associated with improved efficacy and
decreased resistance compared to other antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, a recent study from Malawi
found that integrase resistance was present in 30% of select adults failing dolutegravir. While this may be an
overestimate, children have multiple risk factors that increase the risk of developing integrase resistance
including greater reuse and resistance to companion antiretroviral drugs, lower rates of viral suppression,
higher viral load at failure, and more severe immunocompromise.
To address this knowledge gap we will quantify integrase resistance in a population of children failing
dolutegravir in Nigeria and utilize this resistance data to develop and validate a rapid diagnostic in collaboration
with colleagues there. The 2021 World Health Organization HIV Drug Resistance Report specifically calls for
surveys of integrase resistance in order to provide early signals of emerging dolutegravir resistance. Our
population of highly treatment-experienced children who were rapidly transitioned to dolutegravir ART, of which
12% have detectable viremia, represents such a clinical population at increased risk of developing integrase
resistance, and will inform nationally representative surveys of drug resistance.
Nigeria is home to more children living with HIV than any other country in the world. A national survey of pre-
treatment drug resistance among ART-naïve infants ≤18 months of age (2016) shows high rates of resistance,
including to the most widely used companion drugs among children: abacavir and lamivudine. Such resistance
may predispose children to develop integrase resistance. Since 2004, APIN Public Health Initiatives has
provided HIV care and treatment to over 22,000 children in Nigeria, and thus is uniquely positioned to provide
critical drug resistance data from multiple pediatric sites/regions across Nigeria. We propose to evaluate
integrase resistance among 500 children in Nigeria failing dolutegravir-ART at two different time points to
provide critical data on the evolution of integrase resistance. We will further utilize these data to develop rapid
diagnostics to detect specific integrase resistance mutations with the goal of making dolutegravir resistance
testing accessible globally via rapid, low-cost assays. These studies address a critical gap in knowledge
regarding integrase resistance among children failing dolutegravir ART, will inform future surveys of drug
resistance, and will support the development and validation of a rapid integrase resistance assay in this
setting. This has the potential to impact international guidance on dolutegravir use and resistance testing for
this vulnerable population of children."
10921006,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for a large proportion of global cancer cases, including head and
neck, cervical and anal cancers, among others. HPV-related cancers are caused by certain high-risk strains of
the virus, which can cause long-lasting infections that eventually lead to the development of cancerous changes.
The mainstay for addressing HPV-related cancer is prevention, particularly through prophylactic vaccination and
screening, and definitive treatment of early pre-cancerous lesions. Despite the success of prevention efforts, the
prevalence of early and late-stage HPV-related cancers is still staggering, with over 18,000 deaths annually in
the US. One promising new treatment approach is immunotherapy, in particular immune checkpoint inhibition
(ICI). However, only 15-30% of patients respond to ICI treatment, highlighting the need for new techniques to
boost efficacy. Although ex vivo adoptive T cell immunotherapies, in which human T cells are genetically modified
outside the body to target cancer cells, are promising, they have significant limitations due to complexity, cost,
and the need for myeloablative lymphodepletion. Effective therapeutic cancer vaccines have long been the holy
grail as potentially safe and cost-effective in vivo-elicited T cell therapies that could be used in all stages of
disease to boost cancer immunotherapy without the challenges and risks of ex vivo adoptive T cell therapies.
While conventional vaccines largely have not been effective, newer highly immunogenic mRNA cancer vaccines
have demonstrated clear evidence of efficacy with a reduction in recurrence and death in late-stage melanoma
and strong anti-tumor responses in pancreatic cancer. Mini-circular RNA (mcRNA) is a highly biostable
therapeutic cancer vaccine platform that can elicit robust activation and expansion of long-lasting antigen-specific
T cells, achieving breakthrough levels up to 8-fold higher than state-of-the-art mRNA vaccines with, surprisingly,
improved safety and tolerability. Our goal is to develop a highly immunogenic HPV E6 and E7 mcRNA vaccine
that could be used as an off-the-shelf HLA-agnostic product or as part of a personalized HLA-specific cancer
vaccine. In this proposal, we plan to build on a significant body of highly encouraging in vitro and in vivo data to
facilitate rapid development of the mcRNA therapeutic vaccine platform with a highly immunogenic vaccine for
HPV-related cancers. Key results from the proposed investigational studies will demonstrate the superior efficacy
of a LNP-encapsulated multivalent mcRNA HPV16 E6/E7 vaccine compared to a N1-methylΨ mRNA vaccine.
In Aim 1, we will show that a multivalent HPV mcRNA vaccine can sustain the expression of long concatemers
of encoded HPV E6/E7 epitopes that are processed and presented to elicit highly potent and durable T cell
responses that can yield a robust immunotherapy in combination with ICI for HPV-related cancer in mice. In Aim
2, we will characterize the immunogenicity of 5 epitope clusters encoding all of the top human MHC-binding
epitopes of HPV16 E6 and E7 in PBMCs collected from human subjects, and assess the immunogenicity of a
multivalent HPV16 epitope cluster vaccine compared to a benchmark HPV16 mRNA vaccine."

Reversing the negative effects of aging has the potential to delay age-related diseases and significantly improve
the quality of life in old age. In recent findings, we reported that sexual planarians of Schmidtea mediterranea
have evolved a natural solution to age reversal at the whole-body level. However, the underlying molecular and
cellular mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. In this proposal, we aim to investigate two
mechanisms that could potentially globally reverse the aged states of most cells within an organism. The first
involves examining asymmetrical age distribution during stem cell division and differentiation, which plays a
critical role in replacing differentiated and aged cells during tissue homeostasis and regeneration. The second
involves investigating epigenetic regulators that can globally modify chromatin states, leading to gene expression
changes and functional impacts on cellular physiology. Our collective goal is to identify the molecular regulators
of these processes and examine their impact on whole-body age reversal. The proposed experiments have the
potential to identify genes that are evolutionarily conserved in mammals and could ultimately contribute to
improving or inspiring anti-aging medicine in humans"
10905263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Membrane voltage plays a vital role in transmitting information in the brain: neurons regulate their membrane voltage to
communicate and process information, while irregular neuronal voltage dynamics are associated with several neurological
disorders. Therefore, tools for recording voltage signals are crucial for studying brain computations in both healthy and
diseased states. Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs) —fluorescent proteins whose brightness is modulated by
voltage— have been recognized for many years as promising tools with enabling features for neuroscience applications,
including high spatiotemporal resolution and cell type specificity. Particularly sought after are GEVIs that perform well
under two-photon (2P) microscopy, the method of choice for imaging neural activity in highly scattering tissue such as the
rodent brain. We have recently demonstrated that the GFP-based indicator JEDI-2P enables sustained (> 30 min), fast (> 1
kHz), and deep-tissue (400 µm or deeper) monitoring of voltage dynamics in individual neuronal somas in awake behaving
mice. However, JEDI-2P and other green GEVIs are spectrally incompatible with optogenetic tools and the best-performing
calcium and neurotransmitter indicators. Red GEVIs have been developed but cannot report spikes under two-photon
microscopy in vivo. The goal of this proposal is thus to address this technology gap and develop red-shifted voltage
indicators for robust 2P imaging in vivo in combination with optogenetics or green indicators of voltage or other modalities.
We propose several complementary but independent approaches to achieve our goal. In Aims 1 and 2, we propose to conduct
two-photon high-throughput screening of indicators repurposing two different classes of fluorescent domains. In Aim 3, we
propose experimental (higher-throughput screening) and computational approaches to accelerate screening and potentiate
the other Aims. We anticipate that this project will produce red GEVIs that enable robust two-photon recordings of spikes
and subthreshold depolarizations in awake behaving animals. We will also optimize and demonstrate approaches to perform
two-photon all-optical physiology and multi-spectral imaging. These new sensors and methods will allow the neuroscience
community to ask questions that are currently technically infeasible, paving the way for a more detailed understanding of
brain computations and how neuronal functional connections are established and modulated during development, learning,
and aging."

 Clinical recommendations for breast cancer screening and prevention are contingent on breast cancer risk,
yet methods to accurately determine risk for the 63 million women eligible for services are not widely used in
practice. MammoScreen, a web-based application of a clinical decision support tool, was designed for women
ages 40–74 years to identify their individual risks for breast cancer, engage patients in shared decision making,
guide referrals, and consider screening decisions. Patients receive tailored information based on their risk
profiles and preferences in accordance with USPSTF recommendations. The goal of this digitial healthcare
research project is to improve access and quality of care for women, an AHRQ priority population.
 Although numerous breast cancer risk assessment tools are publically available, none exchange data with
the patient’s electronic health record (EHR), missing important opportunities to fully integrate patient
information into prevention decision-making at point of care. MammoScreen was developed and previously
tested by the interdisciplinary team of investigators for the proposed project. In a pilot study, data from
MammoScreen required manual entry into the EHR, which is not feasible across large health systems.
 The proposed project makes innovative use of the SMART (Substitutable Medical Applications, Resuable
Technologies) on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to exchange data to and from
applications external to the EHR, such as MammoScreen, to fully integrate them into routine healthcare. The
use of the SMART on FHIR standard will allow this approach to be scaled not only to a single health system,
but to any EHR system that supports the SMART on FHIR standard.
 The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the ability of the EHR to securely exchange information
with MammoScreen using interoperable, standards-based approaches; provide appropriate clinical and patient
decision support for users; and evaluate its use among patients and clinicians using mixed methods based on
the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance). Accomplishing
these goals would lay the groundwork for integration with other types of healthcare-related applications
designed to extend decision support outside the clinical setting.
Aim 1 (Years 1 & 2): Implement standards-based, safe, secure, interoperable integration of
MammoScreen with the EHR.
Aim 2 (Year 1 & 2 and again, Years 3 & 4) Evaluate MammoScreen acceptance by patients and
clinicians to identify and remove potential barriers to use.
Aim 3 (Years 3-5): Evaluate use of EHR-integrated MammoScreen by clinicians and patients across age
groups (40–49 years; 50–74 years) and measure clinical outcomes."

Hearing loss is a major cause of disability that affects over 48 million Americans. Cochlear implants (CIs) are
neuroprosthetic devices that allow people with profound hearing loss to recover hearing and speech
comprehension. However, CI surgery outcomes are highly variable and difficult to predict, which creates a
challenge for clinicians to guide patient decisions and expectations. Speech recognition is a multisensory
process. Although it is known that visual speech cues can improve auditory speech recognition, the visual and
audiovisual abilities of CI users have not been well characterized before and after cochlear implantation. In my
preliminary data, I show that pre-implantation visual and audiovisual speech recognition predicts post-
implantation auditory speech recognition, suggesting that multisensory integration may play an
underappreciated role in CI outcomes. In the proposed experiments, I will explore changes in visual and
audiovisual performance following CI surgery through a battery of sensory experiments (Aim 1). I will also
assess the neural correlates of any behavioral changes using an innovative approach by simultaneously
recording electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) responses over
time (Aim 2). Finally, I will identify pre-implantation factors that predict post-implantation speech recognition
and synthesize these data into a prediction model using machine learning (Aim 3). Through the experiments
proposed in this fellowship application, I will comprehensively characterize the longitudinal changes in sensory
perception and cortical organization following cochlear implantation. I will also use these findings to develop a
novel clinical tool for predicting CI outcomes. The proposed plan integrates my research interests in auditory
neuroscience with my clinical interests in otolaryngology, and it will set me up for success as a future
physician-scientist."
10906898,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is significant interest in developing therapeutics targeting the protein-protein interaction between nuclear
factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1) for neurodegenerative
disease. A therapeutic that successfully and selectively inhibits Keap1/Nrf2 binding would enhance the cellular
antioxidant response leading to a neuroprotective effect. Such inhibition of the Keap1/Nrf2 interaction could
revolutionize our ability to treat multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease. Inhibitory
peptide therapeutics are of increasing interest but are limited in their pharmacokinetic profiles, cellular
penetration, and efficacy. The proposed approach overcomes these challenges utilizing high-density brush
polymer structures that are capable of engaging Keap1 and displacing the cellular protective transcription factor,
Nrf2. These unique structures, termed protein-like polymers (PLPs), display specific Nrf2-derived peptide
sequences around a hydrophobic synthetic polymer core. Compared to peptides alone, PLPs demonstrate
resistance to proteolysis, improved pharmacokinetics, bioactivity and efficient cellular uptake. The PLP platform
is proposed here for the development of two novel types of Keap1-inhibitors that overcome the current challenges
limiting Keap1/Nrf2 targeted therapeutics. Keap1-targeting PLPs are the focus here due to the documented
neuroprotective role of Nrf2 and the large unmet clinical need in neurodegenerative disease broadly.
 A key focus will be on the development of PLPs to competitively inhibit Keap1 and subsequently establish
their efficacy as Nrf2 activators. Peptides identified via in silico modeling will be incorporated into PLPs and then
evaluated by in vitro and in vivo analysis to determine bioactivity and pharmacokinetic properties. PLPs can be
prepared with morphologies and molecular weights similar to proteins. Therefore, we will explore the effects of
varying molecular weight, and thus polymer length, on Keap1-inhibition and bioactivity. In addition, PLPs can be
prepared with multiple peptide-based domains. This multifunctionality combined with multivalency will be used
to develop Nrf2 mimetics capable of spanning and selectively binding both Keap1 binding sites. Finally, the PLP
platform will be used to design a class of Keap1-inhibitors capable of heterobifunctional binding, enabling
targeted degradation of Keap1. These PLPs, designed as autophagy targeting chimeras (AUTACs), will
selectively target Keap1 and shuttle the protein for degradation through the autophagy pathway.
 The proposed research plan seeks to address the current gaps facing translational therapeutics targeting
the Keap1/Nrf2 interaction. The proposed research will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Nathan
Gianneschi and Dr. Jeffrey Johnson to establish technical skills in both materials science/chemistry and
neurobiology respectively and with access to expertise and equipment at Northwestern University and the
University of Wisconsin. The proposed training plan will develop the applicant into an independent researcher
and foster clinical skills in preparation for a career as a physician scientist developing novel therapeutic platforms."

10930891,"ABSTRACT (CATALYST PROJECT)
While much research has been dedicated to understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD),
the neural circuit dynamics underlying the manifestation of motor signs remain to be determined. Current theories
propose that the power and incidence of beta band (11-35 Hz) oscillations, synchronized throughout the basal
ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit, are associated with the severity of motor signs. Although changes in
bradykinesia and rigidity related to levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been shown to correlate
with the power of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), no study has
deductively demonstrated their causal relationship. Clarifying whether this relationship is causal or
epiphenomenon is critical to advance our understanding of PD pathophysiology. The goal of this Catalyst
Project is to characterize the relationship of rigidity and bradykinesia with beta band oscillations and
their propagation dynamics in the BGTC circuit. We will leverage a new neural control approach capable
of suppressing or amplifying frequency-specific neural oscillations in real-time using DBS leads. This
technique, referred to as evoked-interference closed-loop DBS (eiDBS), is based on the concept that electrical
stimulation with precise amplitude and timing can evoke neural responses that modulate spontaneous neural
activity via constructive or destructive interference. We will characterize how controlled suppression or
amplification of beta band activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) or the STN via eiDBS
relates to the severity of rigidity and bradykinesia in PD patients. We will also test the hypothesis that changes
in the propagation of beta band oscillations (information flow) across the GPi, STN, motor (MC), premotor (PMC),
and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices will be better correlated with rigidity and bradykinesia than the
amplitude of beta band oscillations alone (Aims 1,2). Furthermore, we will characterize the spectral, temporal,
and spatial dynamics of neural responses in the BGTC circuit evoked by stimulation in the GPi and STN. By
combining the evoked response (ER) data with high-resolution imaging and computational modeling, we will
delineate how activation of distinct neuronal pathways in the GPi and STN influences ER dynamics, critical not
only to optimize eiDBS, but also to provide insights into the mechanism(s) of action of DBS (Aim 3)."

Tumors reside within a complex multicellular ecosystem comprised of malignant and non-
malignant cells, where interacting cells and molecules are organized in space and time. The
diversity of these cells and their interactions affect cancer progression and drug response and
resistance, and present opportunities for more precise diagnostics and therapeutics. In this
proposal, we build upon our recent invention of Slide-tags, a single-cell spatial genomics
technology, to enable facile, spatial profiling of human tumors. We will apply Slide-tags across
a broad range of tumor specimens to enable future adoption with minimal training and equipment.
We will extend Slide-tags to measure not only transcription, but also epigenetic states and
genome variation within individual cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our novel computational
pipelines will allow the seamless integration of molecular, cellular and histological
understanding in tumors: they will enable the spatial localization of cell types within complex
tumor environments, the identification of spatially varying gene expression patterns driven by
pathology, as well as the organization of cellular niches. The innovations from this project will
yield a robust, multiomic spatial platform for the routine profiling of human tumors at scale.
Applying this platform will revolutionize our ability to discover changes in tumor spatial and
molecular organization during disease progression and treatment, provide new biomarkers for
diagnostics and prognostics, and highlight new therapeutic avenues."
10923837,"Diabetes is the most widespread blinding disease in working-age adults. Up to 70% of diabetic patients suffer
from corneal problems including neuropathy and epithelial keratopathy (impaired wound healing, ulcers,
recurrent erosions) that impair vision and cause pain and discomfort. Diabetic keratopathy is underdiagnosed,
and therapy remains symptomatic. We previously identified markers altered in human diabetic corneas and
normalized their levels in human corneal organ cultures by gene and nano therapy, which also restored normal
stem cell phenotype and corneal wound healing. Epigenetic changes may contribute to diabetic complications.
Therefore, we examined epigenetic DNA methylation in human diabetic corneas and found a set of genes
abnormally methylated vs. normal corneas. WNT5A gene, a noncanonical member of Wnt regulators of cell
motility, proliferation and differentiation, was hypermethylated in diabetic corneas. Its expression was reduced in
diabetic corneas and stem cell-enriched epithelial cultures. Wnt5a addition accelerated wound healing in
diabetic (but not in normal cells), with stem cell marker expression increase. Inhibition of diabetes-increased
miRNA-203a targeting WNT5A increased Wnt5a and wound healing in diabetic cells. miRNA-203a inhibitor and
WNT5A siRNA reduced wound healing in normal cells. We will identify mechanisms of action of new diabetic
marker Wnt5a, its effects on diabetic corneal cell populations, and normalize its levels in diabetic corneal cells.
We hypothesize that normalization of diabetes-impaired stem cell phenotype and epithelial wound
healing may be achieved by restoring normal expression of noncanonical Wnt5a by blocking its
inhibiting microRNA with a novel nanoconjugate and using demethylating agents.
Specific Aim 1. To identify Wnt5a receptor(s) mediating its effects on diabetic epithelial cells and corneas. Wnt5a
receptors in diabetic limbal cells and corneas will be identified by imaging and functionally, by siRNAs, focusing
first on ROR2. This will allow modulating their expression and signaling in diabetic cells to boost Wnt5a effects.
Specific Aim 2. To examine Wnt5a effects on epithelial wound healing and limbal cell populations in human
organ-cultured diabetic corneas. In these corneas, we will confirm normalizing Wnt5a effects using wound
healing and stem cell marker expression. Changes in limbal epithelial differentiated and stem cell populations
upon Wnt5a (or inhibitors) treatment will be examined by single cell RNA-seq vs. control normal cells.
Specific Aim 3. To test the efficacy of therapies aimed at increasing Wnt5a expression using cultured diabetic
cells and organ-cultured corneas. Diabetic limbal epithelial cells and corneas will be treated with nanoconjugate
with miR-203a specific antagonist and/or with demethylating 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) or Zebularine.
Our aims fit well the priorities set in the NEI Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities. These
priorities include (1) improving the transplantation of cultured corneal epithelial cells, (2) understanding of the
epigenetic regulation of wound healing, and (3) developing methods to enhance the wound healing process."
10919316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) are irreversible, progressive brain disorders, and
AD in particular is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Neurological decline begins up to two
decades before cognitive symptoms are apparent in patients, highlighting the need for early risk assessment,
screening, and treatment. Given the high heritability of AD/ADRDs, genetic testing has the potential to inform
an individual’s risk. Although some common variants in APOE are known to modulate AD risk, the majority of
genetic risk stems from rare variants, which are collectively common in the population but individually have
little population data to support their classification. Thus, most variants in AD/ADRD risk variants are classified
as medically inactionable variants of uncertain significance (VUS), precluding identification and precision
management of high-risk individuals.
To address the need for improved clinical interpretation of AD/ADRD risk genes, Constantiam Biosciences is
developing MAVEvidence, an application that leverages recently-developed multiplexed assays of variant
effect (MAVEs). MAVEs probe disease-relevant functions of thousands of protein variants in a single
experiment and have proven useful for clinical interpretation of cardiovascular and cancer disease risk genes.
Recently, the first MAVEs for AD/ADRD genes generated data for thousands of variants of the AD risk gene
APP and the Lewy body dementia (LBD) risk gene SNCA. The data sets, however, are large and statistically
complex, requiring rigorous analysis before they can be applied as evidence, and are thus largely inaccessible
to clinical variant scientists. MAVEvidence brings several key innovations to the field of AD/ADRD gene variant
interpretation, including a rigorous statistical analysis of MAVE data within a Bayesian framework and
personalized, quantitative AD/ADRD risk assessment. MAVEvidence will be used by variant scientists at
genetic testing companies and diagnostic laboratories to classify variants that would otherwise be VUS, thus
enabling physicians and patients to make informed decisions about AD/ADRD screening and treatment.
This Phase I SBIR proposal focuses on developing MAVEvidence for use by variant scientists to interpret
variants in AD/ADRD risk genes. In Aim 1, we curate and validate data from all three published MAVEs for
APP and one for SNCA. In Aim 2, we calibrate the odds of pathogenicity for each variant based on scores of
known pathogenic and benign variants and then translate these odds to functional evidence that can be
applied directly within existing variant interpretation frameworks. In Aim 3, we generate personalized
quantitative measures of risk based on genotype by integrating MAVE data and population AD/ADRD
incidence data with the goal of validating our model using biobank data. Successful completion of these aims
will de-risk a planned Phase II focused on application to a broader set of AD/ADRD risk genes and
development of a commercial-ready product."
10919315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advances in DNA sequencing technology have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of disease,
including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic
variants can enable early detection, inform precision treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes. However,
the majority of unique variants uncovered by clinical genetic tests have insufficient evidence for confident
classification and are therefore categorized as “variants of uncertain significance” (VUS). The uncertainty
introduced by VUS impedes diagnosis, delays care, and increases unnecessary medical treatment.
Constantiam Biosciences has developed Varify, an innovative platform that addresses the VUS problem at
scale by leveraging the recent advent and rapid proliferation of Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect, or MAVEs,
for variant classification. MAVEs generate functional data for thousands of variants in a single experiment and
have been shown to enable reclassification of 44% of VUS within each assayed gene. Leveraging these large
and complex datasets, however, is challenging and time-consuming for variant scientists at genetic testing
companies and diagnostic laboratories, who spend hours manually searching the literature and evaluating
MAVE datasets in an ad hoc and error-prone process. There are no commercial platforms that curate the
growing body of MAVEs and perform the rigorous analyses required to responsibly apply the data as evidence
within classification guidelines established by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and the
Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP).
Constantiam’s technology reduces the time spent searching and evaluating MAVE data by 90%, removing a
critical barrier by comprehensively curating MAVE data and transforming it into evidence that can be applied
towards classification in minutes. During Phase I, Constantiam Biosciences successfully built a prototype of
Varify, leveraging breakthroughs in Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming to analyze raw MAVE
data for use as evidence. In parallel, we developed a user-facing application, MAVEvidence, for presenting
data and generating evidence reports. The progress made in Phase I has laid a strong foundation for the
Phase II project, which includes the following aims: 1) Expand Varify to include all MAVEs for cancer genes,
and evaluate performance against clinically annotated variants; 2) Evaluate the functional evidence generated
by Varify using population data from UK Biobank; and 3) Integrate Varify-derived evidence into MAVEvidence
and develop automation capabilities for scalability. This proposed Phase II plan will enable Constantiam to
complete development of a first-to-market, commercial-ready functional evidence platform. At the end of Phase
II, genetic testing companies and diagnostic labs will be able to purchase Varify + MAVEvidence to reduce the
time spent searching and evaluating functional data by 90%, addressing a $435M market opportunity while
increasing the actionability of genetic tests for physicians and patients."
10919376,"Abstract
Acoustic tweezers are a promising technological development for the biocompatible, precise manipulation of
delicate bioparticles such as cells and extracellular vesicles. However, their widespread usage is hindered by
their low compatibility with many existing workflows in biological laboratories. In this SBIR project, we will address
this unmet need by developing and commercializing fully integrated, multifunctional, acoustic tweezers on a Petri
dish, termed the smart Petri dish, that can (1) manipulate cells and other bioparticles in Petri dishes in a precise
(resolution: <0.5 µm), contact-free, biocompatible, programmable, high-throughput, high-speed, and easy-to-use
manner, and (2) perform multiple functions (e.g., cell patterning, 3D tissue construction, nano/micro particle
concentration, and cell lysis) within a single Petri dish. In our Phase-I-type R&D efforts, Ascent has successfully
demonstrated the utility and feasibility of the proposed devices by meeting or exceeding the target in all eight
key parameters identified in the Measures of Success. In Phase II, our commercialization activities will improve
the performance of the acoustic-based smart Petri dish chips, develop self-contained, beta-testing-ready
prototypes, and validate their performance across two well-established applications in stem cells and tissue
engineering. Compared to the existing Petri-dish-compatible technologies, our acoustic-based smart Petri dish
technology has the following advantages: (1) High precision: While most current Petri dish-based technologies
can only reach resolutions (for cell/particle positions) of >100 µm, the proposed acoustic-based smart Petri dish
can achieve a resolution (for cell/particle positions) of <0.5 µm, allowing for far more precise and reliable
manipulation. (2) High versatility and programmability: Our proposed acoustic-based smart Petri dish can be
configured to generate various acoustic wavefields and manipulate objects across length scales of nm to mm
regardless of their shape, optical, electric, or magnetic properties. Our device also allows for both translational
and rotational manipulation in all three dimensions and realizes precise manipulation with six degrees of
freedom. It is capable of manipulating both collective groups of cells and individual cells, as confirmed in our
preliminary results. (3) Contact-free nature and high biocompatibility: Our proposed acoustic-based smart
Petri dish manipulates bioparticles in a contactless, label-free, and gentle manner. Our preliminary results
already demonstrated the ability of our acoustic-based Petri dish to maintain the viability of highly sensitive,
fragile cells, such as human-derived mesenchymal stem cells, even after 7 days of acoustic treatment. With
these advantages, we expect our smart Petri dish to vastly expand the utility of the classic Petri dish as a
biological tool, providing unprecedented access to a large array of functions, both essential and new, that
biomedical scientists can adopt to simplify their workflows, increase the speed and accuracy of their experiments,
and enable them to make discoveries that otherwise would not be possible."

The objective of this project is to generate the first empirical estimate of the behavioral cost of carbon – the
human health-related behavioral impacts imposed by incremental increases in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. The societal behavioral costs and benefits of climate stressors caused by GHG emissions remain
unknown in the US and globally. This missing behavioral component of the social cost of carbon (SCC) may
blind both climate and health policy responses to the true scope of consequences from climate change.
This project will evaluate three hypothesized behavioral costs of carbon. This proposal aims to 1) estimate the
first US domestic substance use cost of carbon by linking alcohol consumption observations and substance use
panel data with high resolution meteorological data (i.e. weather and climate observations) across the US; 2)
evaluate the US and global sleep cost of carbon by applying multi-stage multivariate time-series fixed effects
models to estimate associations between local meteorological conditions and both self-reported and
actigraphy-recorded sleep outcomes; 3) assess the preliminary physical activity cost of carbon and estimate
local climate-behavioral impact projections – statistically accounting for acclimatization – for every county in
the US and every region worldwide. In Aim 1, the US substance use cost of carbon will be derived from
estimating climate – substance use response functions for daily household alcohol consumption measured by
the nationally representative Nielsen-IQ Consumer Panel (NIQCP), self-reported individual substance use
registered by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and zip code-level counts of all
substance use disorder emergency department visits (HCUP SEDD) and hospitalizations (HCUP SID) in a
dataset that includes 95% of US hospital discharges. In Aim 2, US and global estimates of the sleep cost of
carbon will be derived from ambient temperature–sleep response estimates using nationally representative US
time use survey data (ATUS) and globally extensive actigraphy data (GSSPAD). In Aim 3, nationally
representative physical activity survey data (BRFSS) and two large-scale wrist actigraphy and
smartphone-based accelerometry datasets from prior research will be linked with global reanalysis (ECMWF
ERA5) meteorological data to estimate climate – physical activity response curves which are then coupled with
climate model output produced by NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) to inform both the US and global physical
activity cost of carbon. This independent research agenda will inform the world's first behavioral cost of carbon
(BCC). The BCC will allow healthcare stakeholders and policymakers to anticipate and mitigate the future
behavioral costs of societal emissions decisions. The proposed research directly responds to the NIH Strategic
Plan's 2021-2025 “disease prevention and health promotion” objective, aligns with the crosscutting themes by
“addressing public health challenges across the lifespan” and “promoting collaborative science,” while also
building cutting-edge spatial data science capacity at the nexus of climate change and behavioral medicine."

 We propose developing and validating a novel platform technology that combines the collection and
chemical analysis of ultrafine particles using an in-situ multispectral technique. The sample, collected directly
onto the analysis substrate, is analyzed via excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. This approach will
be validated against laboratory combustion-generated aerosols, such as diesel exhaust, wood smoke, tobacco
smoke, and against a mixture of environmental pollutants. Within the respiratory tract, particle size determines
the region of deposition and tissue uptake; the chemistry of the particle also affects solubility and determines the
potential for biochemical reaction with tissues and cells. There is a growing awareness that exposure scenarios
are very complex, consisting of time-varying concentrations and chemical composition over a broad range of
particle sizes. Long-term exposure to air pollution has also been linked to increased mortality rates for infectious
diseases, including COVID-19. The proposed research addresses the need for improved personal exposure
assessment and characterization of ultrafine particles in the environment. Low-cost, miniaturized exposure
monitoring devices can shed insight into the relationships between exposure to pollutants and health impact.
Source apportioned measurements of PM concentration with high temporal and spatial resolution can facilitate
the implementation of optimal air pollution mitigation strategies. The anticipated outcome of this project is the
development of a miniaturized spectroscopic sensor that provides an analysis of the chemical composition of
combustion-generated ultrafine particles, which both reflects the particle sources and determines their toxic
potential. The machine-learning algorithms will enable the deconvolution of the complex spectra and
identification of the PM source from the EEM analysis. The broader applications of the technology are
environmental and regulatory monitoring, personal exposure assessment for the consumer market, and
epidemiological studies."
10921719,"Project Summary
This project aims to develop a diagnostic test for congenital Chagas disease (cCD), caused when infection with
the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is passed from mother to fetus during pregnancy. Chagas disease is the
parasitic disease with the highest burden in the Western hemisphere, yet the need remains for accurate and
accessible diagnostics. This is particularly true for congenital transmission of the infection, as treatment in infants
is much more effective and well-tolerated than in chronic adult infections. However, the current diagnostic
standard for infants with a risk of congenital Chagas remains microscopy, which is highly subjective and misses
a large percentage of infections, and IgG testing at 8-9 months after birth, which results in an enormous loss to
follow up. A diagnostic assay targeting anti-T. cruzi IgM would meet the need for an accurate and accessible
point-of-delivery test and enable cost-saving, widespread screening of newborns. Two versions of a test for cCD
based on IgM detection will be developed, the best performing of which will be advanced in Phase II: (1) an IgM
Western blot based on native Trypomastigote Excreted/Secreted Antigen (TESA) and (2) a peptide IgM ELISA
based on Shed Acute-Phase Antigen (SAPA). Both tests will address the need for batch-to-batch and laboratory-
to-laboratory consistency in antigens used and will produce a result in approximately three hours. Panels of well-
characterized congenital Chagas samples and controls, including cross-reactive samples from other parasitic
infections, will be used to optimize both versions of the test as well as determine initial sensitivity and specificity
of each assay format. One major hurdle to commercialization of Western blot-based methods is the difficulty in
interpreting test results. As it is widely recognized that mobile phone technology provides an opportunity to
address such diagnostic challenges, this technology will be leveraged to standardize Western blot interpretation
through development of a prototype smartphone application that can perform automated blot analysis. A
machine-learning algorithm will be implemented for this purpose to interpret IgM Western blot band patterns,
removing the need for subjective human interpretation. The successful completion of Phase I objectives will
demonstrate the feasibility of an IgM diagnostic test for congenital Chagas disease which can be scaled to
manufacturing in Phase II and will address a recognized global and public health priority."

within Sylvester’s catchment area and corresponding priorities informs trainee and faculty cancer research.
CRTEC has developed and maintains a database of more than 4,000 current and former trainees for outcome
tracking, activity planning, and evaluation of CRTEC programs. Sylvester continues to invest $1.3M annually in
education and training, which includes funding for additional positions on cancer research-focused training and
career development grants. This support has led to an increase in cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding
(annual direct costs) from $1.2M to $4.1M during the reporting period. This includes an increase in K awards
from five to 12, and F awards from seven to 25, as well as several new cancer-focused training grants. Guided
by CRTEC, Sylvester faculty have renewed key training and career development grants and obtained new
grants, including an NCI R25 to support undergraduate cancer research and career development, and an NCI
T32 in cancer equity for post-doctoral associates. Investments in education and training as well as extensive
recruitment of scientists and clinicians have increased Sylvester’s capacity to train and mentor a diverse
pipeline of individuals and provide them with a uniquely rich environment for learning, mentoring, and pursuing
cancer research careers."
10933326,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM
The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is
the centralized authority which oversees and provides independent, peer review of the scientific merit, priority,
and progress of all prospective, hypothesis-driven clinical cancer research involving human subjects conducted
at the University of Miami (University). PRMS functions are accomplished by a rigorous two-stage review
process. The site disease groups (SDGs) and clinical research teams (CRTs) perform the initial, Stage 1
PRMS review of potential clinical impact, scientific importance, catchment area (CA)-relevance, and overall
prioritization within the existing portfolio of SDG/CRT studies, as well as assessing each study’s operational
and accrual feasibility. The Stage 2 PRMS review by the PRMC is the definitive, independent, centralized
authority for determining which studies proceed to activation, and which ongoing studies remain active, based
on scientific and clinical merit and accrual progress. The activities of the PRMC are independent and non-
overlapping with the University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). Prioritization and approval by the SDG/CRT
are required before a study proceeds to the PRMC; however, only the PRMC has final and independent
authority to determine which studies will be activated and which underperforming studies will be closed. The
specific aims of the PRMC are to 1) assess the scientific merit of proposed cancer research studies through
robust scientific peer review; 2) prioritize all cancer studies according to Sylvester’s Strategic Plan, mission,
CA-relevance, and Research Programs; 3) confirm that appropriate subject recruitment plans are in place,
target accrual predictions are achievable, and adequate data and safety monitoring plans are defined; and 4)
monitor scientific progress with final authority to terminate cancer studies not meeting accrual goals. To
accomplish these aims, the PRMC ensures that all clinical cancer research studies involving human subjects
are scientifically robust, have appropriate biostatistics, and are prioritized within Sylvester’s research portfolio.
The PRMC also ensures that protocols are aligned with Sylvester’s Strategic Plan for clinical research, are
feasible for completion and meeting specified accrual goals within timeline, have an appropriate data and
safety monitoring plan, and are monitored regularly for accrual, clinical, and scientific progress. During the
reporting period (6/1/2018 to 5/31/2023), the Sylvester SDG/CRTs approved 691 protocols for PRMC review.
Once received by the PRMC, 244 of the 691 studies (35%) received an initial expedited review by the PRMC
Chair, while 447 of the 691 studies (65%), primarily Sylvester’s investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored
studies, were forwarded for full PRMC review. The PRMC closed 49 underperforming studies and facilitated
the closure of an additional 47 studies by the SDG/CRT. As of the end of the reporting period, Sylvester had
293 studies open to enrollment. The two-stage PRMS review process is one of the most critical functions that
Sylvester performs to ensure that the highest quality of clinical research is safely conducted."
11126497,"For effective next-generation vaccines, the identification of high-quality target antigens combined with effective adjuvants will be critical. Immunoadjuvants are key components in vaccine formulations since they enhance and shape immune responses to vaccines in both immunocompetent and immunosenescent individuals. Bacterial Enzymatic Combinatorial Chemistry (BECC) technology allows for the efficient production of rationally designed lipid A agonists which signal through the host innate immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). BECC-based adjuvants generate a balanced Th1/Th2 response yielding antigen and dose sparing, increased T-cell mediated effector immunity, enhanced proliferation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and the establishment of a longer-lasting humoral immunity in adult and aged populations. BECC470s is a rationally designed synthetic TLR4-based ligand from this process.
 
The objective of this proposal is to develop the adjuvant potential of BECC470s and evaluate it for preclinical testing with three established immunogenic vaccine antigens: 1) Influenza A HA protein, 2) Staphylococcus aureus detoxified α-hemolysin, and 3) Pseudomonas spp. T3SS fusion protein (L-PaF). BECC470s will be evaluated for biophysical properties, safety, immune stimulatory potential, and antigen sparing when developed as independent vaccine formulations that include Antigen System (AS) biosimilars (AS01, AS03, and AS04 biosimilars, and micellular) in both adult and elderly populations. These studies will allow for IND-enabling development of BECC470s through immunological characterization studies, as well as compound optimization for three separate and unique component vaccines."
10913488,"Project Summary/Abstract
Within the US, ticks transmit 18 human pathogens, one of the most serious being Lyme disease, with an
estimated 476,000 cases per year. Current tick management and human repellent and toxic products were
designed either with protection against ticks as an “after-thought” or through the use of a pyrethroid insecticide
to which ticks are increasingly developing resistance. There is also a current push by consumers to use natural
and organic pest control products. As global temperatures rise, leading to a higher incidence of tick-borne
diseases, there is a critical need for improved tick management products. This Phase II application will build on
the development of novel polymeric microparticles as carriers of non-volatile acaricides by BanfieldBio for the
DWFP award on “Murine autodissemination for long-term, area-wide control of ticks”. Based on encouraging
preliminary evidence, we propose to adapt the polymeric microparticles to manufacture microporous
polymeric granules and fibers that can be formulated to release volatile repellents and toxicants. Formulated
granules would be used in landscape treatments to kill and repel ticks, and the fibers would be woven into
outerwear fabrics to protect humans from acquiring and being bitten by ticks. Candidate active ingredients are
nootkatone and 2-undecanone, which could be used alone or in combination with each other and/or
permethrin. The project will target two species, blacklegged ticks and lone star ticks, both of which are
important vectors of human disease, and will employ laboratory and field experimentation to explore and
develop both types of formulation into novel prototype products.
The proposed research and development would culminate in five potential outcomes: 1) a proprietary
polymeric microporous granular composition formulated with one or more repellent and/or toxic compounds,
2) a demonstration that the formulated granular composition is effective against immature and adult ticks, and
ready for scale-up, testing and development as a landscape-level tick preventive treatment, 3) fabric
incorporating proprietary polymeric microporous filaments formulated with one or more repellent and/or toxic
compounds, 4) demonstration that the fabric formulated with one or more repellent and/or toxic compounds is
effective against immature and adult ticks, 5) fabric formulated with one or more repellent and/or toxic
compounds manufactured into gaiters, and ready for technology transfer to commercial fabric production and
incorporation into multiple types of outerwear clothing.
As applicable, patent applications will be filed, the results published in peer-reviewed journals, and pathways
to operational implementation and commercialization will be identified and exploited."
10913490,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The Nigerian Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is leading implementation
and scale-up of a national sodium reduction program with other national, state, and international agencies
using the WHO’s “Best Buy” SHAKE package (Surveillance of salt intake, Harness industry, Adopt standards
for labelling and marketing, Knowledge to empower consumers, and Environments to promote healthy eating).
SHAKE provides evidence-based recommendations for population-wide sodium reduction interventions for
hypertension prevention and control. Our research will support and embed in this program’s implementation
and scale-up for late-stage implementation research for hypertension prevention and control by evaluating the
extent to which the program is implemented using a type III hybrid, mixed methods study design through
repeated: 1) stakeholder interviews, 2) populations surveys, and 3) retail surveys. We will use
implementation research methods during adaptation, planning, and initial implementation for baseline (Years 1-
2, UG3 phase) and of follow-up (Years 3-4 and Years 5-6, UH3 phase) assessments. A much-needed dietary
sources of sodium study will also be performed at baseline and Years 5-6 follow-up to target/track sodium
reduction efforts according to local context and culture. The retails surveys over the study period will capture
novel data on packaged, unpackaged, and informal restaurant/hawker food through the international
FoodSwitch program, which combines a consumer facing tool with crowdsourcing to better define Nigeria’s
food supply. We will use the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework
throughout both phases. The formative research period will include Exploration and Preparation, when we will
perform quantitative and qualitative measures of key process indicators, relevant contextual factors informed
by CFIR, and relevant Proctor implementation outcomes, acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness. As
implementation is started, we will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance
(RE-AIM) framework, including implementation outcomes (feasibility, fidelity, adoption, acceptability, and cost)
and contextual factors associated with the Implementation and Sustainment phases. We will disseminate our
finding via mass media advocacy campaigns and will extend our existing implementation research training
program to stakeholders for knowledge translation through evidence-informed policymaking to optimize
sustainability. We will host multisectoral stakeholder meetings to facilitate cross-sectoral collaboration,
dissemination, and multi-level policy coherence among sectors include food, health, trade, and law, among
others. The proposal builds on the team’s existing NHLBI-funded large-scale hypertension control program
with team members from University of Abuja, Northwestern University, and The George Institute for Global
Health, the latter which is performing a parallel, GACD-funded assessment in China with similar methods."
10913499,"The metabolism of corticosteroids by host-associated microbiomes rivals that of host peripheral tissues. Side-chain metabolism of corticosteroids is capable of changing the functional class of steroid. The focus of the current project is elucidating the microbial enzymes involved in (Aim 1) the side-chain cleavage of cortisol and reduction of 17-keto resulting in 11-oxy-androgens (Aim 2) 16-dehydroxylation yielding 17-epiprogesterone derivatives. These pathways are significant because they are hypothesized to potentiate diseases relevant to the mission of NIH. The formation of 11-oxy-androgens in the intestine and urinary tract is hypothesized to affect host immune function, and may be a risk factor for prostate cancer. The formation of 17-epiprogesterone derivatives are known to derive from microbial metabolism of host 16-hydroxyprogesterone; however, the physiological role of these absorbed metabolites is not currently known. We have discovered enzymes involved in 17-keto steroid metabolism, and are now focusing on functional metagenomic discovery of additional isoforms (Aim 1). We also show a cultured anaerobe capable of corticosteroid 16-dehydroxylation We will apply previously established bioinformatics approaches to uncover the diversity of host-associated bacteria encoding homologous sterolbiome enzymes (phylogenetic analysis, sequence similarity networks). We present additional robust preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of our studies that include (1) collection of 180 stool samples for functional metagenomic screening (2) utilization of RNA-Seq for steroid-inducible gene discovery (3) heterologous expression and characterization of numerous microbial sterolbiome enzymes (3) establishment of enzyme assays and steroid metabolomics. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo established four decades ago by combining transcriptomics, heterologous protein expression, enzyme assays, phylogenetic and sequence similarity networks, synthetic biology, and functional metagenomic screening to discover the precise nucleic acid sequences encoding corticosteroid side-chain metabolizing enzymes. Successful completion will potentiate research into the cause and effect relationships between the gut sterolbiome and host diseases, and is expected to lead to translational approaches (probiotics, enzyme inhibitors) to modulate the gut microbiome to restore and maintain health."
10923384,"Project Summary
 In May 2023, the Surgeon General declared a public health epidemic of social isolation and loneliness in
the United States. Loneliness—the subjective experience of distress at one's perceived lack of social
connection—has reached an all-time high in the United States, with roughly half of U.S. adults reporting
sometimes or always feeling lonely. It is a key transdiagnostic symptom across psychopathology and serious
risk for many deleterious outcomes, including depression, anxiety, dementia, stroke, inflammation,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, suicide, and premature death. The premature mortality rate associated with
social isolation and loneliness is greater than that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes per day and nearly three
times that of obesity. With the enormous economic burden—more than $6.7 billion in healthcare spending
annually among older adults alone—addressing this problem is a public health emergency. Despite this, the
neural, cognitive, and behavioral mechanisms that underlie forming and maintaining interpersonal relationships
at the individual-level are still poorly characterized—which is crucial for generating new policies, health care,
and preventative interventions. This proposal aims to characterize how and when computations along a
cognitive hierarchy of social information processing (e.g., perception, learning, inference, decision-making)
impact social connection, and consequently, loneliness. Because loneliness can emerge via disrupted
computations at multiple points along this hierarchy, the proposed project will utilize state-of-the-art
computational, behavioral, and neural methods and apply theory-based as well as data-driven models of brain
and behavior to identify computational phenotypes of loneliness. Aim 1 is to assess how loneliness impacts the
motivation to seek social connections via the perception of social cues. Aim 2 is to examine how loneliness
affects learning from social information, a key ability in forming social connections via. Aim 3 is to characterize
how loneliness impacts the ability to infer others' beliefs and act accordingly, which is key for maintaining social
connections. This work expands a new direction of interpersonal computational psychiatry: integrating theory
with computational methods to understand the interplay between mental health outcomes and computations
underlying interpersonal relationships, which is critical for identifying risk factors of chronic loneliness and
designing more personalized interventions to prevent future epidemics."
10923617,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to develop a reliable, clinically proven diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology which will
mitigate the impacts of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The proposed technology reduces the cost of DR treatment,
mitigates its overall social and public burden, and helps save the vision of millions of people, the vast majority of
which are from underserved communities with disparities in access to high quality medical care. DR is among
the leading causes of vision loss in the world, affecting more than 230 million people. In the US, ~38 million
people are affected by diabetes and ~30% go on to develop DR. This devastating complication of both type I
and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive retinal vasculature. Minority and medically
underserved populations are particularly susceptible to the complications of diabetes, including DR. DR causes
17% of vision loss in African Americans compared with 8% in non-Hispanic whites. Limited data on the
prevalence of DR in Native American populations suggests that in some tribes it is as high as 45%. Some studies
show as high as a 200% increased risk of DR in Latinos as compared to non-Hispanic whites. Our proposed
intervention aligns with the NIH’s Health Disparities Research Framework by promoting health equity in NIH-
defined health disparities populations (i.e., Black, Latino, Native American, and others) by increasing
access to quality of eye care and improving vision health outcomes with early interventions that are
effective in minority populations. While there is no cure for DR, there are a variety of treatments that must be
applied as early as possible to prevent further damage. Recent studies have shown that small changes in the
retinal vasculature’s oxygen saturation are a reliable indicator of pre-stage and early-stage DR—before structural
damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of achieving sufficiently high
resolution to detect these changes, a major need exists for the development of advanced retinal oximetry
technologies with proven clinical utility. Bioxytech delivers for the first time a non-invasive technology
capable of providing pre-stage and early-stage DR detection before structural eye damage occurs.
This Phase I project is based on a novel non-invasive imaging technology which leverages spatially modulated
light to capture a retinal oxygenation image in one snapshot. Further, the proposed technology is well-suited to
characterize the multi-layered structure of the retina, where absorbance is a limiting factor for other technologies.
Initial human clinical studies using this technology have found that it can detect DR at least 4-13 months prior to
conventional diagnosis. Building on these promising results, the proposed project: 1) further develops the
technical and software components of the technology, 2) performs a clinical evaluation study at two sites which
serve almost exclusively minority communities, and 3) integrates a novel machine learning platform to enhance
the accuracy of early diagnosis and classification, as well as to introduce autonomous image analysis. This will
enable more accurate classification of DR and facilitate patient risk stratification for more appropriate monitoring."
10920948,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the principal cause of dementia worldwide with its incidence anticipated to double
every 20 years as the population ages. It represents an ongoing public health crisis, compounded by the lack of
effective therapeutics to attenuate or reverse its progression. The principal obstacles to treatment are the inability
of drugs to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) and their potential to cause adverse effects when administered
systemically. The unmet need of effective drug delivery systems for AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD) led
to the application of a variety of nanomaterials including carbon-based nanotubes and intranasal delivery
systems in order to encapsulate noxious drugs during their delivery and reduce drug toxicity. Unfortunately, many
of these alternatives, like carbon nanotubes, are themselves toxic, reducing their applicability. To surmount these
obstacles, Somatoceutics, LLC aims to utilize nanotechnology to apply materials, functionalized structures or
devices having novel properties in order to generate tools that may serve as new diagnostics, therapeutics and
preventatives. To this end, we identified a natural peptide-based nanomaterial derived from the C-terminal 41
residues of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2 residues 249-289), which we named SMC-101
nanotubes (NTs). We have shown that SMC-101 peptides self-assemble into NTs that are 35 nm wide by 10 –
1,000 nm long driven by disulfide bond formation. They are stable and can be loaded with drugs such as
doxorubicin for cell delivery mediated by an intrinsic RGD motif, targeting them to integrins. Thus, SMC-101 NTs
represent natural, peptide-based drug delivery agents that provide a safe, non-toxic advantage over current
nanoparticles for delivery of drugs across the BBB. In this Phase I proof of principle application we hypothesize
that SMC-101 NTs will exhibit high stability and the ability to transcytose the BBB endothelium for efficient CNS
penetration. The objective of this application is to demonstrate the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of SMC-101
NTs by completing the following two Specific Aims. The goal of AIM 1 is to optimize and standardize SMC-101
NT assembly, drug-loading, and BBB transcytosis in vitro. We will standardize SMC-101 NT assembly to
generate 100 nm long NTs. Immortalized human hCMEC3/D3 endothelial cells on Transwell inserts will be used
to demonstrate SMC-101 NT transcytosis as a model of the BBB. RGD-dependence for SMC-101 NT cellular
uptake and transcytosis will be determined. In AIM 2 we will evaluate the toxicity of SMC-101 NTs in mice and
their ability to deliver galantamine (GAL) to the CNS. We will compare the effectiveness of SMC-101 NT
encapsulated vs. “free” GAL in improving CNS penetration. These studies will provide strong proof of principle
demonstrating the efficacy of SMC-101 NTs as drug delivery agents for the treatment of AD. This will establish
SMC-101 NTs as safe, effective drug delivery agents for future development in a Phase II application leading to
commercialization and human therapeutics."

Scale-up manufacturing of microneedle stamp for peanut allergen immunotherapy
Food allergies affect 30 million people in the USA and 17 million in Europe. Six million children, roughly 1 in 13, in the USA
have at least one food allergy; this equates to at least 1 in every classroom. Currently, there is only one FDA approved
therapy in the USA for food allergies. Food allergies are expected to grow 10% annually until at least 2022. It is also common
for someone to have more than one allergy. This is a growing, underserved global market that has few treatment options. A
meaningful initial therapy would be one that reduces the chance for anaphylactic reaction after accidental exposure. Such a
therapy will help bring peace of mind to families, allow for children affected by food allergies to have better quality of life, feel
less socially out casted and most importantly reduce the potential for death from accidental procedure.
Moonlight Therapeutics is developing a targeted way to administer allergens into the top skin layers to desensitize an allergic
patient, using microneedles applied to the skin for only a few minutes. Microneedles can deliver into topmost skin layers,
near immune cells, with high precision and reproducibility. The company’s first treatment is focused on peanut allergy and
is called MOON101. We have demonstrated efficacy of our approach in a pre-clinical mouse model of peanut sensitization,
completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and received a U44 clinical trial grant to conduct the first ever clinical study to
evaluate the safety and tolerability of MOON101 in peanut allergic subjects.
The objective of the CRP grant is to improve the current microneedle coating method so that large-scale clinical trials for
safety and efficacy can be conducted. There are 2 main improvements that will be the focus of the new drop-on-demand
coating system: (1) An automated coating method for microneedles to allow for increased production rate and (2) the ability
to concurrently coat different allergens onto a single microneedle array. We have identified a particular piece of equipment
that can be customized to suit our needs. Our approach will be to purchase this equipment, set it up and demonstrate that it
can be used for clinical production of MOON101. We will first evaluate it for coating of peanut allergens, and then determine
if we can coat multiple allergens simultaneously. This will address future needs of treating multiple allergies concurrently.
Overall, this grant will enable Moonlight Therapeutics to advance the production capabilities of their platform. It will set the
stage to evaluate the efficacy of MOON101 to treat peanut allergy in a Phase 2 clinical trial and begin to address treatment
of multiple food allergies."

MD, PhD, a psychiatrist and clinical neuroscientist in the Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center
at VA Puget Sound. His immediate career goal is to combine his established training in positron emission
tomography (PET) with newly acquired and ongoing training in the pathobiology and translational research of
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and strengthen his training in group-wise neuroimage statistical analysis. Long-
term, he intends to establish an independent research program focused on using molecular neuroimaging to
enhance understanding and guide therapeutic development for neuropsychiatric disorders. Research:
Approximately 20% of service members returning from Iraq have experienced mTBI resulting in somatic,
cognitive, and behavioral symptoms leading to substantial disability and interference with job and family
relationships. Neuroinflammation has been implicated as an important contributor to the acute and chronic
effects of blast mTBI, and is associated with subsequent neurodegeneration. Both Veterans with history of blast-
related mTBI and a battlefield-relevant mouse model of repetitive blast mTBI demonstrate persistently elevated
IL-6. Furthermore, blast-exposed mice demonstrate persistent microglial pathology that is strikingly similar to the
neuropathology very recently identified in Veterans with blast-induced mTBI. This proposal specifically
addresses the need to understand if neuroinflammation is persistent following blast mTBI by imaging the
translocator protein kDa 18 (TSPO), a well-validated biomarker of neuroinflammation and a protein associated
with microglial activation. Using PET and the TSPO selective radioligand [18F]DPA-714, Dr. Terry will image mice
following blast mTBI (SA1), which provides a unique opportunity to control injury repetition and acuity, and to
characterize in vivo imaging results against ex vivo histopathological evidence of neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration. Second, Dr. Terry will image TSPO using PET in Veterans with a history of blast mTBI (SA2)
to demonstrate the presence of chronic neuroinflammation. Resulting quantitative images of neuroinflammation
will be correlated against clinical measures and other biomarkers already collected from those Veterans. Career
Development Plan: This proposal serves Dr. Terry's short- and long-term goals by building his translational and
clinical research expertise in three critical areas: 1) translational application of PET neuroimaging, 2) translational
biomarker study and clinical assessments of blast mTBI, and 3) become an independent researcher-clinician
within VHA. Professional development activities include: routinely scheduled meetings with career mentors,
formal graduate coursework in statistics, neuroinflammation, and PET analysis; regular participation and
presentation for local seminars in mTBI and neuroimaging; and presentation of research at national scientific
conferences. By virtue of these goals, Dr. Terry will seek to clearly differentiate himself as an independent VA
investigator who is both unique from his mentors and complementary to their efforts in helping Veterans with
blast mTBI. Environment: Dr. Terry's training will be guided by an exceptionally multidisciplinary mentoring team
comprised of senior faculty who are experts in blast mTBI, human biomarker collection and study, mouse blast
mTBI pathobiology, and PET image research and analysis. His primary mentor, Dr. Peskind, is recognized as a
leader in the field of blast mTBI and has successfully mentored multiple trainees through CDA to independent
faculty position. Co-mentors Drs. Cook, Innis, and Mr. Muzi are fully-funded research faculty with expertise in
mouse models of disease, molecular biology, neuroinflammation, and PET neuroimaging and analysis. His
consultants include experts in in statistical analysis (Dr. Millard), PET imaging (Drs. Kinahan and Miyaoka), and
radiochemistry (Drs. Grierson and Kassiou). These investigators have established professional collaborations
with Dr. Terry and are invested in the success of the aims outlined herein."
10909922,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal combines work on viral ion channels and de novo protein design. Our work on the M2
proton channel from influenza A virus focuses on the mechanism of inhibition and proton movement through
the channel. M2 is also the target of the amantadine class of influenza drugs, and most isolates of influenza A
virus are now amantadine-resistant. Crystallography, computation and 2DIR will be used to interrogate the
mechanism and aid in design of drugs that inhibit M2 in amantadine-resistant strains of the virus. In parallel,
we will expand our studies to examine the mechanism of conduction and inhibition of the E-proteins from
coronaviruses, which have structures and functions largely similar to M2.
 De novo protein design provides a means to test and refine our understanding of protein structure and
function. We are developing computational methods to design proteins that bind small molecules such as
drugs and metalloporphyrins. We are also designing membrane proteins to elucidate the principles by which
they fold and function. To probe the mechanisms of highly selective proton conduction proteins, we are
designing proton-selective channels that test a hypothesis that networks of water molecules (water wires) can
form dynamically and transiently through apolar stretches of the proton conduction pathway in proteins. The
water wires would allow conduction of protons but not large hydrated alkali metal ions such as K+ or Na+. We
also are engaged in design of proteins that bind to and transport nutrients such as amino acids across
membranes, and devising screens to test them in vivo."
10916562,"ABSTRACT
Comprehensive identification and characterization of senescent cells in morphologically intact human tissues is
important for understanding senescence in vivo and the targeted removal of these cells to improve healthspan
and lifespan. This task has been challenging due to the lack of universal and unequivocal markers characterizing
the senescence state, which reflects the complexity of the senescence phenotype and the existence of highly
heterogeneous senescence programs. A preferred avenue for discovering senescence markers is to spatially
map ‘omics’ states of cell types in different tissues and life stages at single cell resolution. The overall goal of
this project is to (i) develop a spatial, single-cell-resolution, multimodal method that simultaneously analyze
transcriptome, open chromatin, and proteome (or secretome), and (ii) optimize and scale it for mapping
senescent cells in human tissues. The PI’s laboratory has recently developed a novel technique PIXEL-seq
(polony-indexed library-sequencing) and applied it to spatially profile transcriptome with 1-µm resolution and high
RNA capture efficiency. To realize its potential for studying in vivo senescence mechanism and production-scale
data generation, three specific aims will be pursued: 1) In UG3 Year 1, demonstrate PIXEL-seq-based spatial
transcriptome, proteome, and ATAC-seq assays with single-cell resolution; 2) In UH3 Year 2, optimize and
combine these assays for human tissue mapping; and 3) In UH3 Years 3-4, scale up application to human heart,
liver, and lung tissue mapping. Under the first aim, PIXEL-seq will be developed to achieve single-cell resolution
by image-guided cell segmentation (Aim 1A) and expanded to spatial proteome (Aim 1B) and open chromatin
accessibility assays (Aim 1C) by rendering DNA-tagged antibodies and Tn5-treated chromosomal DNAs,
respectively, to capture by polony gels. For the second aim, the proteome assay will be optimized and scaled to
200-plex using polyclonal mini-binders, allowing the cross-validation of senescence markers and associated
isoforms and post-translational modifications (Aim 2A). These assays will be integrated for multimodal data
capture and validated using human tissues (Aim 2B). In the third aim, the application will be scaled up by
increasing throughput of polony gel fabrication (Aim 3A) and to deliver to the CODCC for public release of high-
quality data on several sites of multiple organs from several individual tissue donors (Aim 3B and 3C). The
investigators will also participate in the Consortium common project and other collaborations yet to be formed.
The proposed project is innovative in that this method will for the first time generate the spatial multimodal human
tissue data at unprecedented depth and resolution. It is significant because the assays do not require specialized
equipment and can be widely implemented in the SenNet and other single cell consortia."
10919225,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cellular senescence is a pillar of aging, acting as a key driver of aging and age-related diseases.
Telomeres play a major role in cellular senescence. When telomeres become critically short or
damaged, they elicit a DNA damage response (DDR) that drives senescence. Our laboratory
developed sophisticated methods to detect senescent cells in tissues based on the co-localization
between telomeres and the DDR. Furthermore, we recently developed SenoQuant, a software
that simplifies the measure of Telomere associated foci (TAF), reducing quantification time from
weeks to hours. We now propose to apply emerging technologies such as machine learning and
deep learning to map TAF more accurately and robustly in human tissue sections. This will
address several challenges inherent to TAF analysis, including nuclei detection, staining artifacts,
and quantification time. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Tissue Mapping Centers we will
tailor SenoQuant to the analysis of specific human tissues. Finally, we propose to integrate TAF
with multiplexed imaging methods such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), allowing the detection
of multiple senescence markers in tissues simultaneously. We anticipate that this technology will
greatly advance the spatially-resolved mapping of senescent cells in human tissues and will be a
great resource for the aging and cell senescence community."

Center aims to build the evidence base necessary to establish best practices for telehealth-supported cancer
care. It will execute nimble, rigorously designed clinical trials investigating whether and how telehealth can
enable more cancer care to be safely, effectively, and equitably provided in patients’ homes. The Research &
Methods Core (RMC) is instrumental to the MATCHES research theme: focusing on the development of
methods to integrate complex streams of multi-level data from asynchronous and synchronous encounters so
as to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of telehealth. Specifically, the RMC will generate, refine, validate,
and disseminate novel research methods and outcome measures for the evaluation of telehealth in oncology,
including digital biomarkers based on digitally captured data and electronic patient-reported outcomes. These
activities will directly advance our goal of developing a paradigm for personalized cancer care delivery. To this
goal, the RMC brings high-level expertise, strong infrastructure, extensive resources, and immediately relevant

machine learning, artificial intelligence), and clinical trial design. The RMC will be led by Katherine Panageas,
DrPH, a biostatistician with deep expertise in trial design and health services research methods. She has led
statistical coordinating centers for multiple large projects, including clinical trials and cancer control studies,
and has evaluated complex care delivery innovations. The aims of the RMC are: 1) to provide high-quality data
management for the development of research methods in telehealth, 2) to provide methodological and
biostatistical support for the cluster-randomized Pragmatic Trial and for pilot studies evaluating MSK@Home,
3) to develop and apply novel statistical and research methods to aid evaluation of telehealth-supported cancer
care delivery research and to train early-career investigators in these methods, and 4) to disseminate data,
knowledge, and resources via user-friendly, open-source algorithms to accelerate broader implementation of
telehealth-enabled home-based care. The RMC will develop a framework for processing and analyzing the
multiple data streams generated in the context of telehealth-supported cancer care, as well as play a key role
in reviewing and evaluating the research progress of the Center. It will also support the Pragmatic Trial and
pilot studies and lead the selection and deployment of further telehealth pilot projects. The RMC will work
closely with the MATCH-Light Training Unit of the Administrative Core to train junior investigators in research
methods to advance telehealth research to drive personalized, equitable, and efficient oncology care and

10932416,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CORE C
A major need in host-microbiome research is the development of tractable model systems that provide
a path to understand the mechanistic contributions of gut microbes to various diseases in which they
participate. Germfree mice implanted with “synthetic communities” of cultured microorganisms, provide
such a path as the resulting “gnotobiotic mouse” only contains microbes of known identity and often
genome sequence. However, even when cultured and fully sequenced microbes are used, a major
limitation is understanding the metabolic potential of the microbes involved. High-throughput metabolic
phenotyping of cultured microbes helps to address the knowledge gap associated with the latter point.
The main goals of the Microbial Phenotyping and Gnotobiotic Model Core will be to 1. Provide the
resources for culturing and combining existing microbes associated with resistant starch degradation,
butyrate production, H2 consumption and bile salt hydrolysis; 2. Perform targeted and deep culture on
patient samples that vary in their responses to resistant starch consumption with the goal of modeling
these variations in gnotobiotic mice colonized with the isolated species; and 3. Perform metabolic
phenotyping combined with genome sequencing on isolated microbes so that their causal roles in
determining the outcomes of resistant starch consumption on GVHD and bile acid modification on
Enterococcus infection can be investigated through the lens of defined functions. In the latter case,
such functions will include phenotypes believed to be directly involved the outcomes of the proposed
disease models (degradation of resistant starch, butyrate production and bile salt hydrolases activity).
However, we also anticipate extending our phenotypic measurements to define other metabolic facets,
such as microbial interactions with dietary nutrients beyond resistant starch, so that we can better
understand their contributions to community behavior, butyrate production, etc. The Martens Lab has
extensive experience assaying cultured human gut bacteria in custom phenotypic growth arrays (e.g.,
for broadly measuring polysaccharide-degrading abilities), building synthetic communities from groups
of microbes with defined phenotypes and driving differences in host disease progression through
exogenous forces on the microbiota, such as diet. This core will be foundational to the execution of
experiments in several of the proposed projects and will also establish the resources for building
complex gnotobiotic systems that still preserve an experimental path towards defining mechanisms."

The purpose of the Bioinformatics Core is to support the research projects in the analysis, management,
and synthesis of large scale and heterogeneous datasets. Data will come from a variety of sources
including microbiome amplicon and genome sequencing, plasma RNAseq, metabolomics, and from
individuals of mice and patients in clinical trials. By centralizing the development, maintenance, and
implementation of bioinformatics tools, and providing an efficient framework for synthesizing data, this
core will provide state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities that are responsive and tailored to user’s

Core has the following specific aims, each involving direct interactions with the research projects and
other cores: (1) Develop, maintain, and implement bioinformatic pipelines for analysis of genomic and
transcriptomic data from microbiomes and their hosts. This aim is crucial for supporting the research
project aims that are focused on understanding how changes in the microbiome composition and
metabolism are linked to metabolites, immune responses, and health outcomes. Bioinformatics Core staff

Gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is implicated in maintenance of heath, and in disease outcomes,
including graft versus host disease (GVHD), the most significant complication of allogeneic hematopoietic
cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Current understanding of the role of microbiome and its effects on GVHD
is limited to correlations. The biology of GVHD is complex, and mostly understood and therapeutically
targeted, from the perspective of the donor and host derived immune cells. The cell intrinsic role of the
epithelial targets of GVHD, such as the host intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is not well understood. An
emerging concept in biology is that rewiring of cellular metabolism is crucial for their resilience to stress.
The host IECs are in a constant state of stress from donor T cells and inflammation during GVHD. But
whether the metabolic responses of IECs are altered and are critical for GVHD severity has never been
explored. The microbiome plays a critical role in nourishing the IECs through generation of metabolites,
including the short chain fatty acids, butyrate, as a function of host diet. Their role in the metabolism of
IECs after allogeneic HCT, and whether it regulates GVHD severity is unclear. This proposal aims to fill
the above knowledge gaps and test the central premise that the cross-talk between butyrate and the
mitochondria of host IECs corrects its cellular metabolic defect and mitigates GVHD. The proposal will
build on the exciting and seminal preliminary data, which show that following allo-HCT the host IECs
demonstrate profound metabolic defect characterized by deficiency of mitochondrial complex II, and
butyrate mitigates the defect and attenuates GVHD. We will thus probe the heretofore unexplored nexus
between microbiome derived metabolites and the host metabolic pathways in regulation of GVHD. If
successful, it could lead to strategies to rationally modify microbiome to target non-immune host cells
and mitigate GVHD without causing global immuno-suppression."

Bile acids (BAs) are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, conjugated with taurine or glycine, stored
in the gallbladder and released into the duodenum in response to food ingestion. In the intestine,
conjugated primary BAs undergo amino acid deconjugation by bacterial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs)
followed by several modifications including 7α-dehydroxylation by anaerobic bacteria to produce
secondary BAs. Although a main function of BAs is to promote the intestinal absorption and transport of
dietary lipids, it is now recognized that BAs also regulate diverse physiological processes. Vancomycin-
resistant enterococcus (VRE) is one of the leading causes of bloodstream infection in patients undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in hospitals around the world including the United
States. Dominant intestinal colonization in patients undergoing allo-HCT can lead to bloodstream VRE
infection, high mortality rates, and patient-to-patient transmission in hospitals. Notably, VRE can be
eradicated from the intestine by fecal transplantation and several symbiotic bacterial species have been
shown to promote VRE intestinal clearance. However, the mechanism by which members of the
microbiota inhibit VRE colonization remains unknown. To understand the mechanism that regulates VRE
colonization by the microbiota and how VRE affects the intestine during allo-HCT, we have developed a
VRE model in the mouse by transferring a vancomycin-resistance plasmid from a human VRE strain to
a mouse Enterococcus fecalis strain by conjugation. Upon treatment with antibiotics, mouse VRE
accumulated in the mouse intestine to levels comparable to human VRE in patients undergoing allo-HCT.
Using the mouse VRE model, we have identified a role for BAs in the regulation of VRE colonization in
the intestine. Deconjugation of glycine or taurine-conjugated BAs is the key rate-limiting step in BA
metabolism which is mediated by bacterial BSH enzymes. We have identified mouse symbiotic bacteria
that mediate BA deconjugation and promote the production of cholic acid (CA) and DCA from conjugated
BAs which correlates with the generation of VRE-inhibitory activity. We also found that the amounts of
primary and secondary BAs in the intestine are decreased after allo-HCT. The overreaching hypothesis
is that specific BA-processing bacteria, BAs and host factors including the bile acid receptor FXR regulate
VRE colonization and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allo-HCT. To address these hypotheses,
we propose three specific Aims to understand the role of BAs and BA-induced signaling in VRE
colonization and GVHD."

The production of butyrate from gut microbiomes results from interactions between microbes in anaerobic
food webs. Identifying butyrogenic combinations of microbes, environmental conditions and fermentable
fibers will underlie strategies for manipulating the microbiomes in BMT patients to provide therapeutic
concentrations of butyrate. Hypotheses: 1) Maximal production of SCFAs from fermentable fibers
requires the combination of a primary fiber degraders, secondary fermenters and hydrogen-consuming
microbes. 2) The ratio of butyrate to total SCFAs is dependent on the taxonomic membership of
communities, which is selected by the concentrations of H2, bile acids, pH and turnover time of the
environment. Approaches: We will use covariation analysis of microbiomes from a healthy human
cohort to identify butyrogenic combinations of fermentable fibers, physical conditions and microbes. We
will test these predictions by assembling synthetic communities of the identified microbes and measuring
butyrate production in vitro under various conditions, including the removal of hydrogen by
hydrogenotrophic microbes. We will also select co-evolved butyrogenic communities from fecal inocula
using multiple passages through media containing fermentable fiber as the primary carbon and energy
source.
Once transported into an intestinal epithelial cell, butyrate can be oxidized by mitochondria. It and can
also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis through Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs)
located on the nucleus. Understanding the interaction between a butyrogenic microbiome and epithelial
cells will provide a mechanistic explanation of the temporal dynamics between butyrate production and
host cell respiration. Hypothesis: In vitro and in vivo respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis in colonic
epithelial cells will be stimulated by butyrate. Approaches: Respiration and PPAR activation will be
measured in enteroids exposed to butyrate under varying environmental conditions. For in vivo estimates
of respiration, mice at six weeks of age will be placed on a Western diet supplemented with a fermentable
fiber(s) or accessible starch. GI tissues will be harvested at intervals up to 12 weeks and succinate
dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activities will be measured to quantify the capacity for cellular
respiration. Cell respiration and mucosal O2 concentrations will be tracked in germ-free mice treated 5-
aminosalicylic acid, a PPAR agonist, to distinguish between mitochondrial biosynthesis and butyrate
oxidation. Mice colonized with synthetic communities of microbes to be used to test the impact of
microbiomes of different butyrogenic capacity on respiration."

Creating a pathway for trainees to enter the clinical and translational science (CTS) workforce, including students
from backgrounds often underrepresented in STEM and CTS, requires early engagement while in training.
Addressing the needs of trainees at the forefront of their CTS education and stimulating CTS interest in historically
underrepresented student populations to foster the development of a diverse CTS workforce are central to the
efforts of the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), the first and only CTSA Hub
in the state of New Jersey. Our R25 grant application, leveraging the resources of the parent UM1 Award, proposes
the creation of the NJ ACTS Clinician Research Experiential Summer Training (CREST) Program involving: A) a
mentored research and interprofessional training in clinical and translational science component for medical and
pharmacy students enrolled at Rutgers who are prime for early intervention as the number of physician-scientists
are in decline and there are limited nationwide programs for training pharmacist-scientists; and B) an outreach
component to stimulate interest, engage, and foster CTS for Rutgers undergraduates participating in the NJ
Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF) program for students from educationally and economically disadvantaged
backgrounds, and for medical students at City University of New York (CUNY), whose majority of graduates go
on to practice primary care in underserved communities. In component A, 10 medical and pharmacy students will
participate in mentored research and interprofessional training in clinical and translational science each summer.
This comprehensive 10-week program provides students with hands-on research training using state-of-the-art,
case-based learning along with career development workshops and formal training in translational science. The
objective of CREST Component A is to immerse medical and pharmacy students in research experiences that
advance analytical and technical skills and stimulate their pursuit of advanced research training. Component B
broadens the impact of the CREST program and benefits a diverse population of students. In this component,
medical and pharmacy CREST participants will serve as “ambassadors” who will meet in hybrid (in-person/virtual)
sessions with Rutgers EOF undergraduates to discuss their experience and paths to medical and pharmacy
school, and to share their enthusiasm for and the importance of their CTS research. Component B will also offer
the opportunity for 1st and 2nd year CUNY medical students to complete the online/asynchronous translational
science digital badge. After completing the badge, these students will be offered the opportunity to attend in a
virtual format the research presentations from students in Component A. The objective of CREST Component B
is to foster interest and educate undergraduate and medical students from underrepresented backgrounds about
the CTS process. Ultimately, CREST will build a well-trained and diverse workforce prepared to address
challenges in clinical and translational science and improve public health."

This is a revised Phase I STTR application to develop and test a device to predict severe acute kidney injury
(AKI). Prediction of future risk of developing Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) has been a goal for decades. The
treatment of patients with severe AKI and severe AKI that requires dialysis (AKI-3 and AKI-D) is significantly
different than for patients with mild-to-moderate AKI (AKI-1 to AKI-2). No currently available biomarkers are
strong predictors of the development of severe AKI, nor can they differentiate AKI-1 and -2 from AKI-3 and -D.
We have discovered that extensive cleavage of a protein occurs in the urine of patients with mild AKI that will
progress to severe AKI. This cleavage does not occur in healthy controls or patients with mild AKI that will not
progress to severe AKI. Preliminary data suggest that an assay that uses this cleavage to predict severe AKI
will be both highly sensitive and highly specific. In this application, we propose to develop a point of care test
that can detect the amount of cleavage of this protein. We will use this test to predict the future development of
severe AKI."

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant chemical modifications in human messenger RNA
(mRNA). m6A in mRNA is dynamically regulated by the effector proteins that install, remove, and specifically
recognize m6A-modified transcripts, which are known as writers, erasers, and readers, respectively. Growing
evidence has suggested the significant roles of m6A in cancers including acute myeloid leukemia, endometrial
cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma. Dysregulations in m6A, its effector proteins, and related metabolites
have been shown to significantly influence the development of tumors, drug resistance, prognosis, and the
spread of cancer in various forms. However, understanding of the explicit roles of m6A in cancer biology remains
incomplete. Current efforts on understanding epitranscriptomic regulations heavily rely on altering the expression
of an effector protein, which typically generates global alterations to the modification levels on hundreds of mRNA
substrates and perturbs all other molecular interactions involving the effector protein beyond their roles in
regulating RNA modifications. With such convoluted results, it is challenging to deduce the explicit functions of
m6A on specific genes. To identify key regulatory m6A-modified transcripts in cancers, tools that enable efficient
and precise installation of m6A(s) at any one or multiple mRNAs of interest are highly desirable. One major
challenge is that the existing m6A writer or methyltransferases suffer from slow turnover rates, dependence upon
auxiliary proteins, and sequence biases of RNA substrates. Here we propose to develop a directed evolution
platform to evolve RNA MTases with improved catalytic efficiency and reduced substrate sequence recognition
biases. This directed evolution platform will leverage in vitro compartmentalization and m6A-specific
endoribonucleases to achieve rapid enrichments of functional MTase variants from a diverse (1010) library. The
evolved MTases will be further fused with RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems to achieve site-specific
installation of m6A with high efficiency and reduced off-target editing."

University of Michigan Surgical Oncology Research Training Program
There is a critical need for surgical oncologists to be trained in research disciplines. The purpose of this surgical
oncology research training program is to foster the development of productive and successful physician
scientists. Weiping Zou, M.D., Ph.D., the Charles B. de Nancrede Professor of Pathology, Immunology, Biology,
and Surgery and Jacqueline Jeruss, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Surgery, Pathology, and Biomedical Engineering
serve as Co-Directors of this program. Trainees will be surgical residents enrolled in a two-year fellowship.
Specific aims of the fellowship are: 1) design, implement, analyze and report a research project; 2) obtain
instruction on fundamental research methods and clinical studies/trials; and 3) obtain instruction on fundamental
cancer biology and immunology, and health services research principles.
The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center provides an extensive breadth of cancer-related research
laboratories and programs to the trainees. The Rogel Cancer Center is an NCI-designated Cancer Center that
is among the top 7 cancer centers in terms of NIH research funding. All preceptors within this training program
are members of the Rogel Cancer Center. This program benefits from the strong track record of the Department
of Surgery in attracting academically oriented surgical residents. Each trainee will be assigned a mentor(s) to
implement a research project during the program. The program curriculum includes extensive instruction focused
on fundamental cancer biology and immunology principles, as well as instruction directed towards academic
career development. Formal instruction in the responsible conduct of research is required and provided through
the University. An External Advisory Committee of internationally renowned experts in clinical cancer care and
research has been enlisted to provide guidance and support for this important program.
This training program has been in existence for six funding periods spanning 30 years. The program continues
to be highly successful and has never gone unfilled, having enrolled 61 trainees. Of the trainees, 18% were
individuals from underrepresented minority ethnic groups, and 36% were female. According to a 2020 study,
Demblowski et al. found that, as of June 2020, only 0.7% of surgeon scientists held NIH R grant funding.1 A
recent survey of prior trainees revealed that 47% of respondents received external funding and 89% reported
involvement in clinical trials research. Among the 45 trainees who completed the T32 fellowship and their formal
clinical training, 87% are employed at academic/teaching hospitals. Narahari et al. suggest institutions and the
NIH provide increased early-career support to surgeon-scientists to assist surgeon-scientist career trajectories.2
This T32 program has been highly successful in meeting this critical objective of preparing young surgeons for
highly successful academic surgical careers."
10924030,"Emerging evidence suggests that the recurrent form of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) tends to worsen,
with more severe and longer episodes as people move into adulthood. Yet, we are still a very long way from
treatments that can reduce short- and long-term Risk for Depressive Relapse (RDR). Understanding specific
mechanisms of RDR is urgently needed to promote relapse prevention (and may have long-term benefits for
treatment). The present proposal uses a treatment that has evidence for modifying the ruminative habit, a
tendency to approach difficulties and associated negative emotions with a repetitive, passive and abstract
mental pattern (habit). In contrast, we teach adolescents to utilize adaptive, concrete and specific mental
patterns (e.g., problem-solving, emotion processing). Rumination focused CBT (RFCBT) was developed to
specifically target and reduce or modify the ruminative habit. Initial work among adults and our pilot data
among adolescents suggests that rumination can be effectively reduced with RFCBT. In addition, work by our
group and a few other small studies suggests that the ruminative habit can be measured at the neural level in
connectivity of brain nodes in the Default Mode Network (DMN, increased within network connectivity) as well
as in patterns of connectivity between the DMN and Cognitive Control Network (CCN). As such, we proposed
to use RFBCT to modify the ruminative habit in 160 adolescents (age 14-18) with remitted MDD (via KSAD-PL)
and elevated rumination (above T of 50), with the goal of achieving significant clinical change in rumination,
and to observe changes in connectivity between key DMN and CCN nodes associated with decline in the
ruminative habit. The latter knowledge may provide information on how to use alternative therapies (e.g.,
neuromodulation) to effectively modify the ruminative habit and the associated neural network pathways, which
would lead to greater precision in the targeting of treatment. The RFCBT arm (N=30) is compared to an
assessment only (AO) arm (N=30) for the R61, and to an active therapy, Relaxation Therapy (RelaxT) for the
R33 (N = 50 in each group), that shares some of the active strategies for change.. For R61, we expect that
(Aim 1) RF-CBT will result in (a) significant decreases in rumination and (b) decreased connectivity from LPPC
to RIFG, both ""Go"" criteria for continuation to the R33 phase. For (Aim 2), we expect that degree of homework
engagement will relate to degree of change in (a) ruminative habit, (b) in LPCC-RIFG rs-fMRI connectivity, and
degree of increased activation during exploratory rumination induction task. Stability of RRS changes will also
be evaluated at 12 months. This R61/R33 has the same Go criteria of RRS change (effect size of .5) and
LPCC - RIFG connectivity changes (.5 effect size). In addition, the R33 adds prediction of MDD recurrence
(Aims 3a (dimensional) and Aim 3b(categorical)) to proceed to the RO1 multisite phase. Our preliminary data
suggest that even if our Go criteria are not met, we will make iterative gains in gaining a better understanding
neural network targets, both in maintenance of or compensation for the ruminative habit, as well as for RDR."
10924033,"Summary
The PI3K/Akt signaling is one of most important oncogenic events in human cancers. It regulates many aspects
of biological functions including cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism important for cancer initiation and
progression. While extensive efforts have been made in the last three decades to understand the downstream
effectors responsible for the biological and oncogenic processes regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling, the upstream
signals mediating PI3K/Akt signaling activation upon diverse growth factor stimulation is not well understood.
Understanding and defining the upstream mechanisms responsible for PI3K/Akt signaling activation will not
only provide new insight into how PI3K/Akt signaling activation is orchestrated, but also offer novel paradigms
and therapeutic targets for cancer intervention. Although it has been well established that PIP3 is critical for
the membrane recruitment and subsequent activation of Akt, our recent studies provide the evidence that Akt
undergoes methylation and subsequent non-proteolytic K63-linked ubiquitination, which are crucial for Akt
membrane recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation and activation upon stimulation with diverse growth
factors, opening up a new frontier for Akt signaling regulation. Of note, we identified SETDB1 as a
methyltransferase for Akt K64 methylation and TRAF6 ligase as an upstream E3 ligase triggering K63-linked
ubiquitination and activation of Akt, and these events are required for cancer progression. However, the
outstanding questions remained to be addressed are how SETDB1 and TRAF6 are activated or recruited to the
Akt complex upon growth factor treatment to trigger Akt methylation and subsequent Akt ubiquitination and
activation, thus promoting oncogenic processes. The goal of this study is to dissect the upstream regulatory
mechanisms by which growth factors activate and recruit SETDB1 and TRAF6 ligase to Akt complex to elicit
Akt methylation and subsequent Akt ubiquitination, define the mechanism by which Akt ubiquitination
facilitates Akt membrane localization and activation, and finally explore the role of these regulatory modes in
cancer development and develop small molecule inhibitors targeting these regulatory mechanisms. Our
preliminary results revealed that SETDB1 and TRAF6 undergo novel posttranslational modifications, which are
crucial for methylation, ubiquitination and activation of Akt by growth factors and oncogenic activity. We
hypothesized that SETDB1 and TRAF6 undergo the novel posttranslational modification upon growth factor
treatment, which recruits SETDB1 to the Akt complex and activates TRAF6 E3 ligase to facilitate Akt
methylation and subsequent Akt ubiquitination and activation, thus leading to tumorigenesis. Our innovative
hypothesis has been formulated based on our preliminary results and prior research. We proposed three
specific aims to validate this provocative and paradigm-shifting concept using cutting-edge technologies
including xenograft, organoids from genetic mouse tumor models and patient derived tumors, patient-derived
models (PDX), knockin mouse models, genetic mouse tumor models and pharmacological approaches. This
application is significant, therefore, because it is expected to provide the knowledge needed to develop
pharmacologic strategies that will allow concurring cancers with aberrant PI3K/Akt activation. Our study will
open up a new avenue for PI3K/Akt signaling regulation, but also offer new concepts and strategies for cancer
targeting."
10924034,"Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is
limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most
dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be
easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more
effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors
that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are
spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on
reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for
novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.
 In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine
interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to
neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human-
machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform
intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this
information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a
paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional
office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current
epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.
 To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including:
(1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud-
based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral
neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful
new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep
Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a
two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe
networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward
therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine
learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me
that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class
of interactive, human therapeutic devices."
10924037,"Project Summary Abstract
The 26S proteasome conducts most regulated protein degradation and eliminates toxic proteins in vivo. The
proteasome is an unusually large and complex ATP-dependent protease comprising nearly 70 individual
polypeptide subunits. Although the conventional thinking has been that the proteasome is assembled from these
subunits in a single, rigid stepwise sequence, recent evidence from our group and others unexpectedly suggests
a broader “landscape” of assembly routes may exist in vivo. Although this possibility has not yet been tested,
such an assembly landscape would ensure that this essential biological process can continue effectively in the
face of assembly roadblocks, and would provide a powerful means to adjust the speed or volume of proteasome
biogenesis in response to the cellular environment. There is an increasing interest in harnessing proteasome
biogenesis to help treat conditions as diverse as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding
whether such an assembly landscape exists, and if so, how it is harnessed to ensure rapid and faithful
proteasome biogenesis, will be critical to guide development of such assembly-targeted therapies.
The goal of this multi-PI application is to test the hypothesis that a proteasome assembly landscape exists in
vivo, and that the relative flux through possible routes within this landscape is governed largely by kinetic factors
that change in response to the intracellular environment. By combining the PIs’ respective expertise in
proteasome biology and in enzyme kinetics and single molecular biophysics, we hope to validate this new
paradigm for proteasome biogenesis. The proposed studies, described below, will add a critical new dimension—
time—to our understanding of proteasome assembly in vivo.
Our experimental approach contains two complementary but independent Aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize a newly
established collection of cutting-edge single-molecule and ensemble fluorescence assays to characterize the
kinetics of specific proteasome assembly steps. Experiments under this aim are designed to test the hypothesis
that the relative flux through two possible assembly routes is primarily under kinetic control, but can be tuned by
exogenous factors such as ligands or proteasome-interacting accessory proteins. Aim 2 will employ a suite of
newly developed chemical-genetic approaches to assess the relative flux through two possible assembly routes
in vivo, and to understand how the flux changes in response to environmental stimuli. Experiments under this
Aim will also test in living cells the predictions derived from our in vitro kinetic model of assembly established in
Aim 1. The outcomes of these studies will lead to a deeper understanding of proteasome biology and of
macromolecular assembly in general, and also promise to illuminate new therapeutic avenues for cancer,
neurodegeneration, and other diseases."

Cell-based therapies hold immense potential to revolutionize medicine by offering personalized, curative
treatments for patients. However, their efficacy to date has been hampered by challenges in successfully
delivering cells to target tissues. Standard-of-care intravenous infusion delivers cells systemically, which works
for blood-based diseases, but not for solid tissue diseases; cells become trapped in filtering organs and never
reach the target. Injecting liquid cell suspensions directly into tissue does not work well either, as cells
experience death and lack of retention within the tissue. A potential solution is to encapsulate the cells in
hydrogels, which are 3d structures which can act as protective carriers. Beyond helping cells to survive the
injection process, hydrogels can also increase the likelihood that cells engraft within the tissue, as they can be
designed to anchor to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tissue, or to eventually dissolve, leaving behind
cells that have integrated in the ECM. One class of hydrogels in particular - shear-thinning hydrogels - provide
a promising mix of mechanical properties for clinical applications. The challenge, however, is that formation
and encapsulation of these hydrogels is extremely variable, and manual methods have not been reproducible
enough to allow for clinical translation.
 Cellular Vehicles Inc. is proposing the development of a system to automate and standardize the
production of ‘cells in hydrogel’ preparations. Building on our prior success developing the Odyssey System for
automation of ‘cells in media’ preparations, we, along with our collaborators at Drexel University, will work
together to develop a novel version for this product for cell-laden hydrogel therapies. This project will push
forward a novel, automated method to formulate, encapsulate, and inject cell-laden hydrogels with increased
consistency, with the goal of eventually improving cell survival and retention in the diseased tissue. The
project's aims include developing an automated method for hydrogel mixing, designing a protocol that achieves
uniform cell encapsulation, and assessing the success of injection through clinically relevant formats.
 Successful completion of this project will lead to a Phase II project during which we will advance the
scalability and robustness of the technology, aiming to optimize the automated process for larger-scale
contexts while ensuring consistently high cell viability and homogenous hydrogel formulations. The Phase II
project will include preclinical testing in an animal model to evaluate the safety and capability of the automated
cell-laden hydrogel delivery system to inject into tissue. These advancements will position the technology to be
submitted to the FDA Class II 510(k) de novo pathway. FDA approval will lead to partnerships with cell therapy
developers, and clinical translation. Overall, the outcome of this research will greatly advance the clinical
potential of cell-based therapies, particularly for treating solid-tissue diseases."
10928049,"ABSTRACT
Immunosuppression required for lifesaving solid organ transplantation is complicated by significant
morbidity including increased recurrence of latent viral infection in transplant recipients. Approximately
60-70 percent of adults in the United States are latently infected with Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Control of
latent CMV depends on a continuously active immune response. In both healthy individuals and
immunocompromised transplant recipients, latent CMV has a profound effect of shaping the T
lymphocyte repertoire. We previously showed that the combination of immunosuppression and latent
CMV is sufficient to induce “accelerated” aging in the T cell compartment during the first year after kidney
transplantation. Immune aging or immunosenescence diminishes the capacity to respond to infection
and vaccination. However, whether the acceleration of aging continues to occur after the first year and
whether it is confined to the T cell compartment has not been studied. Our preliminary data suggests a
rapid aging of the B cell compartment over the first 2 years post-transplant as well as poor antibody
responses to vaccination in those with latent CMV. In this renewal, we hypothesize that latent CMV
continually shapes and ages the immune system in an accelerated manner after transplantation resulting
in diminished heterologous immune responses. Using a network of VA transplant centers and an
experienced team of transplant physicians and scientists, we will test this hypothesis with the following
specific aims: 1) determine the effect of latent CMV on immune aging in the B cell compartment, 2)
determine if accelerated inflation and aging continues after the first-year post- transplantation
and 3) determine whether immune changes induced by latent CMV can be used as predictors of
successful responses to SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination responses. Results from these studies
will substantially expand our understanding of fundamental changes to the immune system induced by
CMV in the setting of solid organ transplantation thus providing critical knowledge that will aid in the care
of this at-risk Veteran population."
10929742,"SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH (SDOH) RESEARCH PROJECT: PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US, individuals and families living in poverty are placed at increased risk for cancer. Living in an under-
resourced environment and having limited access to affordable and healthy food and opportunities for physical
activity play a central role in cancer risk. Suboptimal diet quality and physical inactivity are both higher among
economically disadvantaged households compared with more resourced households—and these disparities are
even more pronounced among individuals living in income-based housing. Thus, translating evidence-based
lifestyle interventions to income-based housing communities offers potentially high public health impact—
however, to enhance effectiveness and mitigate cancer disparities, such efforts must be conducted in partnership
with residents and target multiple levels of the social-ecological model. To that end and in close partnership with
the Virginia Advancing Cancer Control Equity Research Through Transformative Solutions (VA-ACCERT) Center
Housing Collaborative Community Advisory Board (HCCAB), the overarching goal of this project is to implement
a multi-level lifestyle intervention to mitigate cancer risk for residents of income-based housing communities
across Virginia. The HCCAB identified a critical need to promote community-level social cohesion and collective
efficacy, and a multi-level lifestyle intervention targeting diet quality and physical activity is aligned with their
priorities. Grounded in evidence and from previous work, this intervention spans the individual, community, and
built neighborhood environment levels—and posits collective efficacy as a mechanism of action. Using a cluster
randomized, hybrid type 2 trial design, this intervention will assess both the clinical effectiveness and
implementation effectiveness, which will be implemented over 6-months, followed by a 6-month maintenance
phase. Income-based housing communities (n=12) will be randomized to intervention or delayed intervention
control, and 480 participants (~40 per housing community, ≥18 years) will be enrolled and assessed at 0, 6, and
12 months. Primary dual effectiveness outcomes are diet quality and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(ASA-24 and accelerometry). Co-primary implementation effectiveness will be evaluated using the RE-AIM
Framework and its contextual enhancement, PRISM. Finally, investigators will examine mechanisms of action
associated with greater clinical benefit and maintenance of behavior change. Specific aims include: Aim 1: Test
the clinical effectiveness of the multi-level intervention to promote changes in diet quality (ASA-24) and physical
activity (accelerometry) compared to delayed intervention control among residents of income-based housing
communities in Virginia; Aim 2a: Evaluate implementation effectiveness of the multi-level intervention; Aim 2b:
Systematically evaluate facilitators and barriers to sustainability of each level of the intervention via a
combination of process data, surveys, and in-depth interviews with residents as well as Public Housing Authority
staff; and Aim 3: Examine putative intervention mechanisms associated with greater clinical benefit and
maintenance of behavior change."

The Virginia Advancing Cancer Control Equity Research Through Transformative Solutions (VA-ACCERT)
Center will support four Community Responsive Research Projects across the five-year project period aligned
with the goal of improving dissemination and implementation of multi-level cancer health promotion and
prevention services to individuals and families living within Virginia’s Department of Housing and Urban
Development-administered income-based housing – communities vastly comprised of racial/ethnic minority
populations with extremely low socioeconomic status yielding unjust health outcomes. Each project will be led
by an academic-community Co-Lead team and will promote iterative, rapid-cycle research that is responsive to
the needs of the Center’s partnering income-based housing communities. In addition, these projects will fuel the
Center’s efforts to promote the development of early-career investigators focused on cancer equity and
community-engaged research. Each academic Co-Lead for the four projects will need to meet the NIH definition
of an early-stage investigator and include a senior Center-associated mentor; priority will also be given to projects
incorporating pre- and postdoctoral trainees. Projects 1 and 2 will be three-year projects beginning in Year 1,
and Projects 3 and 4 will be two-year projects beginning in Year 4. Per the Notice of Funding Opportunity, only
Project 1 has been fully developed and described in this application. Projects 2-4 will be selected through an
academic-community-led, peer-review process and will receive design, implementation, evaluation, and
dissemination support from the Research Methods, Measures, and Data Management Core.
Project 1 Summary: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the
United States. Social drivers of health are often associated with screening uptake. Marginalized groups, such as
public housing residents, are less likely to seek and obtain CRC screening. Project 1 aims to develop a multi-
level and peer-led Colon Health Champion intervention, leveraging interpersonal communication and community
cohesion, to improve CRC screening awareness and uptake within public housing communities. Utilizing an
ORBIT model for behavioral treatment development, Aim 1 will use qualitative methods to collect formative data
to identify critical intervention components via key informant interviews and focus groups with CRC screening
age-eligible adults living in public housing communities. The Project 1 team will iterate and modify intervention
components based on focus group feedback and then identify and train Colon Health Champions to deliver the
intervention. In Aim 2, a randomized controlled trial including 150 public housing residents will determine the
feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the Colon Health Champion intervention, including the impact on screening
completion. Collectively, the proposed research will produce a multi-level, peer-led intervention with the potential
to improve CRC health literacy and screening uptake and advance health equity among public housing residents."

developmental research projects in leukemia for future peer-reviewed funding and/or future independent SPORE
projects. The types of studies to be supported include projects in basic research, clinical research, epidemiologic
studies, and cancer prevention and control research in leukemia. Projects supported under the DRP will expand
the scope of translational research and increase the number of investigators committed to leukemia research.
The DRP will work in tandem with the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) to assist in the development of junior
investigators and in the recruitment and mentoring of Underrepresented in Medicine (URiM) investigators. To
accomplish these goals, the DRP aims to: 1) support developmental research projects in leukemia for future
incorporation as full SPORE projects or application for other major peer-reviewed funding; 2) foster
collaborations between basic and clinical researchers; 3) provide mentoring to junior faculty; and 4) promote the
participation of women and URiM investigators in translational leukemia research and to promote the recruitment
of patients from underrepresented minorities to leukemia clinical trials. New DRP research projects will be
solicited annually, and a total of $370,000 has been committed per year to support CEP and DRP awards,
including $270,000 in matching institutional funds. DRP awards will be for up to $70,000 for 1 year, with a
competitive renewal for a second year of funding allowed. Funds may be used for salary support or laboratory
supplies. The DRP leadership will promote collaborations between basic and clinical researchers through shared
weekly meetings, the annual SPORE retreat, and small group meetings. Where appropriate, mentors will be
identified to work with junior faculty. All DRP awardees will present their research progress to the SPORE
steering committee twice per year."

10933382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite large-scale, nationwide efforts to better address suicidal behavior (defined as thoughts and
behavior) in high-risk Veterans with major depressive disorder (MDD), the development of interventions that
target some of the key risk factors associated with suicide in Veterans with MDD remains limited. That is, while
much intervention research continues to investigate treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that
target behavioral patterns, emotion processing problems, and cognitive styles associated with suicide risk in
MDD, deficits in the neurocognitive substrates that underlie these CBT targets remain under-addressed.
Cognitive remediation (CR) and rehabilitation have long been a primary treatment for patients with other
psychiatric illnesses, like schizophrenia, for improving cognitive functioning and facilitating transfer of cognitive
skills to every-day functioning. However, scant work has examined CR that addresses the neurocognitive
deficits underlying suicidal behavior in individuals with MDD. Empirical work has identified key executive
functioning (EF) deficits that may be specific to MDD patients with suicidal behavior, and meta-analytic work
indicates that CR has moderate effect sizes on cognitive functioning, depression, and daily functioning in MDD.
Thus, the field is in dire need of work that examines CR as a recovery-oriented treatment approach for MDD
patients at risk for suicide.
 The proposed study aims to collect pilot data to test the feasibility and acceptability of adjunctive
neuroplasticity-based CR on key treatment targets delivered via telehealth during this time of COVID-19 in a
sample of 36 Veterans with MDD and a history of suicide attempt(s). Specifically, it will test the effects of an
adjunctive evidence-based cognitive remediation (CR) therapy (adjunctive to treatment as usual) augmented
with manualized “Bridging” sessions on transfer and practice of cognitive control and decision-making/problem-
solving strategies for real-world situations and problems, including those that trigger suicidal thoughts. We
propose to administer the Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Cognitive Remediation (NEAR, termed
CR plus “Bridging” session, CR+Bridging) to a total of 36 Veterans with MDD and a history of suicide
attempt(s). The intervention will be delivered in 20 90-minute sessions (2x/week for 10 weeks). Pre-treatment
assessments of neurocognitive, clinical, social, and real-world functioning will be conducted, including
measures that examine the impact of COVID-19 and its accompanying “social-distancing” restrictions. Post-
treatment assessments of the same targets will be conducted to determine clinical response to and feasibility
of this therapeutic intervention immediately following conclusion of the intervention (Week 10) and at a follow-
up assessment (Week 20). This application is novel in that it constitutes the first implementation of this
intervention in Veterans with MDD and suicidal behavior. Consistent with RR&D’s SPiRE mechanism, this
study is high risk, but it has high potential impact and promise to help improve quality of life for Veterans at
high risk for suicide."

especially those who do not have primary expertise in the areas of 1) measurement of behavior/function and 2)
rehabilitation. Our overall goal is for QBAR to enable COBRE investigators to become leaders in the field by
incorporating innovative measures of behavior and function, such that QBAR accrues regional and national
recognition as a leading research resource for restoration of neural-based function (RNF). In Phase 3, QBAR
will adapt to supporting a broader range of populations (beyond stroke recovery) and to performing the
substantial work required to build out the new QBAR laboratories in the new COBRE space. QBAR’s specific
aims are: 1) Enable outstanding RNF research by providing services for assessment and rehabilitation of neural-
based function. Specifically, we provide a) Quantitative Behavioral Assessment – enabling COBRE investigators
to creatively measure behavior and its physiological correlates to quantify impairments to function and changes
after interventions, in order to ultimately guide individualized rehabilitation treatments; b) Rehabilitation –
enabling all COBRE investigators to study the experience-dependent nature of neural plasticity by standardizing
experience to optimize the treatment effects of restorative therapies by using current state-of-the-art methods
and/or developing novel tools or methods; and c) Theory-based Outcome Measures – by continually developing
innovative methodologies and analysis techniques, QBAR will generate high quality, reproducible data to help
identify behavioral “biomarkers” that allow tests of hypotheses of the underlying mechanisms of impairment and
recovery. 2) Training and Career Development –The overall COBRE training goal is to nurture scientists skilled
in the multiple domains needed to investigate and exploit inherent plasticity, develop and translate novel
mechanism-based, experience-dependent interventional strategies, and improve restoration of neural-based
function. 3) Sustainability – Our key for sustainability will be to increase the user base of QBAR. During Phase
3, we will expand QBAR’s national stature as a resource in behavioral assessment and rehabilitation methods
for RNF with emphasis on expanding expertise in using and developing cutting-edge theory-based outcome

Vaccination against TB and other bacterial and fungal pathogens has been hampered by the lack of appropriate adjuvants for inducing Th17 immunity. Thus, the next generation of vaccine adjuvants capable of inducing broadly protective immune responses against emerging bacterial and fungal pathogens represents a critical unmet need. This Adjuvant Development Contract will advance one such adjuvant – UM-1098: a Th17 inducing synthetic Mincle ligand– towards human clinical trials. UM-1098 was identified through the NIAID Adjuvant Discovery Program via a comprehensive and iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigations to identify a novel synthetic diaryl trehalose Mincle receptor ligand paired with a novel nanoparticle delivery system. This adjuvant and delivery system has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in mice, pigs and non-human primates (NHPs) across multiple highly relevant antigen/pathogen platforms including TB and Bordetella pertussis. The advantages of UM-1098 over previously developed Mincle adjuvants includes improved formulation physiochemical properties, thermostability, robust safety profile, and most importantly, superior antigen-specific Th17, Th1, and humoral immunity across rodents, pigs and NHPs. When co-administered with an antigen, UM-1098 adjuvant induces durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity with demonstrated protection against Mtb and Bordetella pertussis challenge."

self-efficacy and decreased interest in further STEM classes or STEM careers. For schools, falling test scores
and fewer STEM courses offered affect rankings and the ability to attract students and staff. A strong and
growing body of research indicates VR’s promise for improving student engagement and motivation, affect
towards science, and content understanding. But producing VR content that is interactive, accurate, and can be
tailored to different curricula has until now required specialists with expertise in science, curriculum
development, software development, and design. Dynamoid's 10k is a pioneering data visualization platform
that empowers scientists, educators, and researchers to create interactive VR experiences based on real data
without having to learn any coding or design skills. The next developmental phase aims to refine 10k
experience-production methods, construct a scalable curriculum development model, and further validate the
efficacy of immersive 10k experiences.
Aim 1: Refine and replicate methods to create immersive experiences across diverse content areas.
The team will improve the 10k Creator application, refine the 10k content production model, and demonstrate
consistency in the platform’s production of educational experiences across subject matter/content areas. Aim
2: Develop and test a model for developing 10k-integrated curriculum with relevant stakeholders. The
team will gather real-world data from teacher partners about their curricula and implementation environments,
develop diverse 10k-integrated activities, develop assessment strategies, implement a sample curriculum for
one VR experience, and draft guidelines and best practices to enable designers and educators to embed these
experiences within existing curricula. Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of the 10k immersive experiences and

10922579,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common cancer treatment side effect that
impairs quality of life and daily functioning. Some 30% of chemotherapy recipients are estimated to be living
with CIPN at least six months beyond end of treatment, a number sure to grow as the population ages and
incidence of chemotherapy treatment grows. Fortunately, in recent years research and practice in the field of
Oncology Massage (OM) have demonstrated that specific manual therapy techniques can in fact reduce
symptoms of CIPN. However, for the vast majority of cancer survivors at risk, access to such services is very
limited due to the very small number of qualified practitioners, as well as cost and organizational constraints.
This Phase II project will evaluate outcomes of a caregiver education mobile app that teaches lay caregivers
how to use OM-informed massage techniques specific to CIPN in supportive care at home. The program to be
tested is called “Peripheral Neuropathy Relief (PNR).” It will deliver accurate information about what CIPN is,
how specific manual techniques can help reduce its symptoms, and step-by-step instruction in safe and
effective techniques specific to CIPN. If successful, this eHealth app will enable wide dissemination of a family
caregiver intervention leading to a major impact on quality of life and functioning for millions of cancer survivors
and their family members.
 Phase II will integrate findings from our Phase I study that used a human-centered design approach in
formative research to develop a “minimum viable product (MVP)” (prototype) of the PNR program for usability
and feasibility testing. Feasibility was established by caregivers’ high usability scores and ratings of perceived
value and intent to use the app in the caregiving role. Phase II will complete development and then evaluate
the app’s impact on CIPN patients and caregivers in a three-arm randomized controlled trial with 150
patient/partner dyads, comparing PNR to attention control and usual care conditions. Specific aims are as
follows:
 Aim 1. Produce a revised version of the instructional content based on Phase I outcomes.
 Aim 2. Complete development of the mobile application that will deliver the instructional program and
related supplemental materials to patients and caregivers.
 Aim 3. Assess impact of home-based utilization of the PNR program on cancer survivors with CIPN
and caregivers applying the instruction.
 Hypotheses. (1) In dyads using the PNR intervention, patients will report significant improvements over
baseline in CIPN symptom and interference scores; and caregivers will report significant improvements over
baseline in caregiver esteem and attitudes toward caregiving for CIPN. (2) Outcomes for dyads in the PNR
intervention will be superior to those of the usual care and attention control conditions."
10925222,"Project Summary
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially life threatening disease caused by the novel viral
pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Approximately 20% of COVID-19
patients experience severe disease, typically presenting with bilateral pneumonia, and about 5% progress to
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS results from a combination of virally induced lung injury and
the rapid influx of immune cells that release inflammatory mediators leading to a hyper-activated state known as
cytokine storm. COVID-19 ARDS is further exacerbated by a unique diffuse coagulopathy leading to thrombus
formation in the venous and arterial circulations and microthrombi in capillaries of the lungs. Predisposing factors
for this coagulopathy include increased fibrinogen, activated coagulation cascade, platelet activation, hyper-
inflammation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and endothelial cell damage. Understanding the
pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy and ARDS is critical to finding effective therapeutic interventions.
Accumulating evidence indicates critical roles of neutrophils in both ARDS and immunothrombosis in COVID-19.
Our preliminary studies identified a novel population of low-density neutrophils (LDN) which expresses
intermediate levels of CD16 (CD16Int LDN) in COVID-19 patients. The number of CD16Int LDN correlated with
disease severity, levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6/TNF-a, D-dimer levels, and clinical outcomes. In addition,
CD16Int LDN showed spontaneous NET formation and evidence of in vivo platelet activation and granule
exocytosis. Based on these findings, we postulate that CD16Int LDN play a critical role in the induction of
coagulopathy and pulmonary inflammation in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Three specific Aims
are proposed to further dissect the underlying mechanisms. Aim 1 will comprehensively characterize LDN
subsets using proteomics and transcriptomics approaches. The information gained from those studies will be
used to refine our CyTOF antibody panel. We will use this panel to track differential neutrophil clusters in
longitudinal patient samples. Aim 2 will determine LDN subsets functional changes during disease progression
and their contributions to dysregulated inflammatory response and coagulopathy in severe and critical COVID-
19 patients. Neutrophil degranulation, NET formation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, apoptosis, and cytokine
release will be examined. We will also determine if LDN promote coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Aim 3 will
determine whether inhibition of neutrophil granule exocytosis using our novel TAT-fusion protein inhibitors
prevents activated neutrophil-mediated functional changes and hypercoagulation. We will also use a hACE2 Tg
mouse model to determine the in vivo efficacy of TAT-fusion proteins on lung inflammation and impaired function.
Successful completion of this proposal will provide novel insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology by defining the
role of a unique subset of neutrophils and by establishing neutrophil degranulation as a therapeutic target for
inhibiting inflammatory lung injury and immunothrombosis in COVID-19."
10922364,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the sudden and dangerous loss of kidney function that causes significant morbidity and mortality. A significant fraction of patients undergoing major surgery suffer from AKIs, particularly cardiac patients, with >10% probability of AKI frequently reported. Almost half of hospitalized COVID patients suffered from dangerous (and often deadly) AKIs early in the pandemic, and certain anti-cancer therapies and anti-infectives are known to cause AKIs. AKIs extend hospitalization, and even when kidney function returns to more normal levels, patients suffering from AKIs are at much greater risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Presently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for the prevention of AKI.
Function Therapeutics and its collaborating labs have discovered a new class of antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory small molecules that are biased, allosteric modulators of signaling by the thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1). These compounds, called parmodulins, act to inhibit thromboinflammation by biasing PAR1 signaling towards an anti-inflammatory pathway. They have achieved promising results with in vitro and in vivo models of disease, including infection-promoted thrombosis, coronary ischemia-reperfusion injury, sickle cell disease, and diabetic kidney disease. We hypothesize that their effects may be ideal for the prevention and treatment of AKI in at risk patients.
The objectives of this project are to 1) Optimize current lead series of parmodulins with the potential to meet a Target Product Profile suitable for hospitalized patients at risk for AKI; 2) Validate that parmodulins are efficacious in a mouse model of ischemic AKI.
Parmodulins will be designed, synthesized, and tested in primary and secondary in vitro assays in an iterative fashion. Drug-like profiling, including cytotoxicity, solubility, and stability assays, will be used to identify promising parmodulins for further safety and pharmacokinetic studies. Several optimal examples will ultimately undergo efficacy studies in a mouse model of ischemic AKI, using a protocol for bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury in the lab of Dr. James George in the O’Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This project will help to advance a unique approach to the treatment of AKI towards clinical stages."
10922479,"Project Summary/Abstract
Therapeutic options for people living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are limited to lifelong management of glucose
levels with exogenous insulin. Recently, Teplizumab, a CD3 antibody received FDA approval which can delay
or halt progression of T1D and may be a cure for some patients. The only other therapeutic option is the
transplantation of donor derived pancreatic islets, resulting in a functional cure by negating or easing the life-
long need for onerous management with insulin. In addition to being a constant burden on people’s life,
exogenous administration of Insulin cannot normalize glucose metabolism due to considerable delayed
pharmacokinetics. ß-cell replacement therapy is currently limited by the supply of primary islets as well as a
gridlock with the FDA which failed to approve islet transplantation in the US. A recent clinical trial with stem cell
derived islets has proven the concept of replacing ß-cells with this unlimited cell source. But major limitations
remain, such as the need for immunosuppression which has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in most people
with Type 1 Diabetes. Allogeneic islet cell grafts face multiple hurdles in the transplant recipient : The first is
engraftment in the transplant site which can involve direct exposure to Blood (intraportal infusion) or tissue that
has experienced surgical trauma. The subcutaneous and intramuscular transplant sites that we are developing
represent an inflammatory environment undergoing tissue repair, which can cause inflammatory stress and
death of implanted cells. Second, and most significant hurdle is allogeneic rejection by the host’s immune
system. In people with T1D, the potential autoimmune recognition of allogeneic beta cells is another challenge.
We have discovered a mechanism that renders beta cells resistant to inflammatory stress induced by cytokines
and preventing the loss of beta cells in murine models of autoimmune T1D. This mechanism is mediated by
deficiency in the TET2 gene, coding for an enzyme that effects epigenetic modifications. Here we propose to
harness that mechanism to develop a sc-Islet product that may overcome the hurdles of non-specific
inflammation and targeted immune response in the host. Here we propose to assess the effect of TET2 KO in
sc-Islets on cytokine induced inflammatory stress as well as on the allogeneic and antigen-specific,
autoimmune cellular immune response. A second product development we are proposing is to leverage our
proprietary nanosensor technology to measure the intracellular response to inflammation to enable non-
invasive monitoring of the sc-islet graft. There is currently no other method available to detect inflammation in
live cells. Our nanosensors detect microRNAs specific to cell states such as inflammation (miR146a) and emit
a signal we detect by Raman spectroscopy. These two technologies converge to a product that is more
resilient to inflammation and allows detection of a compromised graft prior to more definite readouts such as
declining or lost graft function, opening a window for therapeutic intervention such as local or systemic anti-
inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment to prevent graft loss."
10923181,"Overview: This proposal directly addresses a critical public health challenge impacting pregnant and postpartum
persons in Zimbabwe: the prevention of HIV acquisition and transmission.
Background/Significance: The risk of HIV acquisition increases three- to four-fold in late pregnancy and early
postpartum. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is safe during pregnancy, effective in preventing HIV, and
available in Zimbabwean antenatal care (ANC) clinics. However, PrEP use remains low among cisgender women
of reproductive age. Individual-, interpersonal/community-, and provider-level barriers (e.g., psychological
distress, stigma, low partner support, limited PrEP knowledge in providers) compromise use.
Preliminary studies: In this R34 application, we propose to develop a multi-level PrEP adherence and
persistence intervention as an adaptation and extension of our TENDAI (‘grateful’ in Shona) program, a problem-
solving approach to reduce depression and increase HIV treatment adherence among people living with HIV in
Zimbabwe. To develop TENDAI, we culturally adapted evidence-based adherence strategies and combined
them with problem-solving therapy for depression, targeting depressed mood as a pathway to reduced
antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. In participants randomized to the intervention, TENDAI was associated
with increased ART adherence and decreased depression. Therefore, our Zimbabwe-, US-, and UK-based team
has the expertise required to extend TENDAI into a multi-level, problem-solving PrEP use intervention
(TENDAI4PrEP) for pregnant persons with psychological distress, their partners, and antenatal care providers.
Approach: TENDAI4PrEP will support PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy among individuals
with psychological distress who have agreed to initiate PrEP use. In Aim 1, we will explore the impact of
intersecting, multi-level barriers to PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence among pregnant persons as well
as barriers to the provision of PrEP among antenatal care providers. In Aim 2, we will use the formative data to
specify the intervention, likely involving a patient component (inclusive of a dyadic session with a partner) and a
provider component, and conduct a small proof-of-concept trial. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility and
acceptability (primary outcomes) of (a) the patient-level intervention in a pilot RCT and (b) the provider-level
component in a pre-post design. Secondary outcomes of the RCT will be (1) self-reported PrEP adherence and
(2) psychological distress, both at the end of treatment, and (3) PrEP persistence (measured via dried blood
spots) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes of the provider component will be PrEP knowledge and PrEP
stigma. We will also explore key implementation outcomes among ANC providers and administrators.
Outcomes/next steps: These aims will lay the groundwork for a full-scale, hybrid effectiveness/implementation
trial which could dramatically improve rates of PrEP adherence and persistence during pregnancy and the
postpartum period, ultimately decreasing HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe."
10923305,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The effective long-term management of HIV infection in pediatric patients faces a multitude of challenges such
as lack of age-appropriate pediatric formulations, high pill burden, unavailability of oral liquid formulations, poor
palatability of existing pediatric formulations, forgetfulness, and emerging independence in adolescents. These
challenges and psychosocial, behavioral, and socioeconomic barriers and health disparities have led to poor
adherence and only ~50% of children living with HIV are able to receive antiretroviral therapy. While the
intramuscular long-acting cabotegravir-rilpivirine (RPV) nanosuspension is highly effective in the long-term
management of HIV infections in adults and adolescents, there is a strong need to develop a non-invasive, room
temperature stable formulation that can allow for self-administration, high adherence and long-term HIV therapy
in children and adolescents affected with HIV. The non-invasive transdermal route is yet to be explored for the
delivery of potent second-generation antiretroviral drugs. Our preliminary study showed that dolutegravir (DTG)
has a great potential to be delivered as a transdermal formulation compared to cabotegravir whereas rilpivirine,
due to its high crystallinity and low aqueous and lipid solubility was not amenable for transdermal delivery. Ionic
liquids (ILs) are low-melting organic salts with a melting point < 100°C and pharmaceutically acceptable fatty
anionic permeation enhancers can be used to develop amphiphilic ILs with excellent drug solubilization capacity,
lipid solubility, and transdermal permeability. We hypothesize that rilpivirine (RPV) and generally regarded as
safe (GRAS) fatty anionic permeation enhancers can be assembled to develop amphiphilic RPV ILs with
excellent lipid solubility and solubilization capacity for DTG and that subsequent incorporation of RPV IL(s) and
DTG into transdermal lipid-based formulations such as nanoemulsion-based gel will improve transdermal
delivery of DTG-RPV combination. Our preliminary data show that a prototype nanoemulsion containing IL of
RPV (RPV docusate) and DTG combination showed significantly higher in vitro permeability of RPV and DTG
through skin mimicking Strat-M membrane compared to DTG-RPV suspension. Aim 1 will focus on the
development, characterization, and in vitro evaluation of nanoemulsion-based gel formulations containing
various RPV ILs and DTG combination suitable for transdermal delivery. Aim 2 will focus on the pharmacokinetic
evaluation of transdermal nanoemulsion-based gel containing RPV IL and DTG combination in NSG mice to
establish the proof of concept. Aim 3 will evaluate the in vivo antiretroviral efficacy of nanoemulsion-based gel
containing RPV IL and DTG combination in a humanized mouse model of HIV infection. The successful
completion of this proposal will lead to the development of pharmaceutically viable formulations containing
combination antiretroviral drugs for effective long-term management of HIV infection in pediatric patients in a
non-invasive manner and this strategy can be expanded to other antiretroviral drug combinations."
10926847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder that imposes a significant burden on
public health. The most recent large-scale genetic study of BP identified 64 associated genetic loci, providing
initial insights in BP pathogenesis. Yet, genetic discovery in BP lags behind other key psychiatric disorders. The
reported genetic loci only capture a small proportion of the total BP genetic liability, with many more variants
across the common and rare allele frequency spectrum remaining to be discovered. In addition, the previous
studied samples were of European ancestry, leaving population specific BP variants uncovered and uncertainty
in how the BP genetic findings generalize to other populations, exacerbating health disparities, and these studies
rarely employed “deep” phenotyping or assessed relevant environmental risk factors. This proposal brings
together an international collaboration of leading investigators from the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore,
India, and Pakistan to form the Asian Bipolar Genetics Network (A-BIG-NET) and carry out a large-scale genetic
study of BP in East and South Asia. A-BIG-NET will generate a BP genetic resource of 27,500 cases and 16,000
controls with rich phenotypic information, measures of key environmental stressors and genetic data from 4x
low-pass whole genome sequencing (4xWGS). This will complement a schizophrenia genetics resource of
22,778 cases and 35,362 controls of Asian ancestry previously assembled by leaders of this network that will be
available for cross-disorder comparisons. Studying BP genetics in Asia is important to the world and the U.S.,
as Asia constitutes 57% of the world population, and Asian American comprises 6.6% of the U.S. population
(21.4 million). The five countries in A-BIG-NET cover 47% of all Asian populations. The specific aims of the
proposal are to: 1) recruit and deeply phenotype 17,500 BP cases, with a focus on BP-I to maximize homogeneity,
and 14,000 controls from four Asian countries; 2) carry out 4xWGS on all recruited samples plus 10,000 BP-I
cases and 2,000 controls collected by a previous study using similar procedures in Pakistan; and 3) carry out a
range of analyses to discover new genetic associations with BP-I across the allelic spectrum in East and South
Asian populations, examine the comparative genetic architecture of BP-I across major world populations and
with other major neuropsychiatric disorders, and perform a novel statistical fine-mapping analysis that leverages
the multi-ancestry genomic diversity and pleiotropy across psychiatric disorders to identify putative causal
variants. Aim 3 will also explore the genetic “validity” of various BP-I subtypes and fit models with joint genetic
and environmental risk factors. This proposal will dramatically increase the worldwide diversity of genetics data
on BP, an important step to accelerate gene discovery in this disorder and advance global mental health equity."
10926855,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project will study the long-term effects of a child health program on recipients’ living standards, labor
supply, health, marriage and fertility and other life outcomes. The project extends a longitudinal (panel) dataset
of participants in a randomized health intervention (primary school-based deworming) when they were 8-15
years old. A novel aspect of the project is its intergenerational linkages: the dataset, the Kenya Life Panel
Survey (KLPS), contains detailed information on health, nutritional, educational, demographic, and labor
market outcomes for over 6,500 Kenyans during 1998-2021, and the health, behavioral and cognitive
development of their 3-9 year old children (collected 2018-2021). The resulting 28-year longitudinal dataset will
allow the study team to exploit experimental variation to estimate the long-run and intergenerational impacts of
a child health intervention. Critically, the most recent KLPS round had an effective survey rate of 84% among
adults 20 years after the start of the deworming program, with balance across treatment arms, alleviating
leading concerns about differential attrition and bias.
We will make use of the panel data structure to estimate the effects of major parental life events and shocks --
such as migration, marital separation, job loss -- on the cognitive and development outcomes of their children.
Having access to repeated measures of both parents and children over time is unusual in any context but
especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs), and we aim to create the premier intergenerational
longitudinal dataset in Sub-Saharan Africa. The matched parent-child data will also allow us to estimate the
correlation between performance on the same cognitive tests taken by parents (when they were in primary
school) and their own school-age children.
We propose to collect KLPS Round 5 with 6,500 adult survey respondents (aged 35-43) and a second round of
surveys and assessments with over 5,000 of their children (aged 6-13). The KLPS sample contains individuals
who participated in the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) mentioned above, and some who
participated in an unconditional cash grant program. Previous research shows that deworming had substantial
positive impacts on the health, schooling, living standards, urban residence and earnings of beneficiaries 10-20
years later; the cash grant program had positive short-run impacts on earnings. We also implemented two
parent-child interventions (reading promotion and sleep promotion), and will estimate the medium-run (4-5
year) impacts of these interventions on child learning and development. The randomized design of all of these
interventions addresses the key methodological problem of confounding. Causal long-run effects of health on
life outcomes have rarely been demonstrated due to the near absence of experimental variation in combination
with detailed longitudinal data on recipients and children. Accurate information on long-term direct and
intergenerational impacts is essential for assessing the cost-effectiveness of child health programs."
10920888,"Project Summary/Abstract
Benzene is a known carcinogen linked to leukemia with primary entry into the human body via the lungs,
thus detecting, tracking and localizing emission sources in real-time are critical for preventing personal
exposures. Premature death from air pollution (due to household air, ambient particulates and ozone) has
increased drastically over the past two decades and was responsible for over 6.7 million deaths in 2019.
The complexity and high operational cost of existing laborious measurement tools for benzene are
responsible for infrequent air sampling activities. The lack of a real-time continuously monitoring benzene
instrument for ambient air is making the impact of environmental exposures on the general population very
difficult to assess.
An easily-operating instrument capable of measuring benzene continuously in real-time with sensitivity of
parts-per-billion by volume (ppbv) and adaptable to typical survey modalities (e.g. mobile, fixed, and
walking) is the overall goal of this research and development program. The proposed project will improve
both scientific knowledge on the impact of benzene on the health of the general population and technical
capability in the measurement of benzene in real-time with high-sensitivity and fast time response.
The Phase I Specific Aims are to engineer a laboratory prototype to detect benzene, establish the
performance of the laboratory prototype, and demonstrate operations in outdoor urban environments. This
proposed benzene detector will take advantage of key enabling technologies including recently available
room-temperature quantum cascade lasers, custom compact system electronics designs, rugged multipass
measurement cell designs, and data analytics for estimating emission rate and source. This real-time
continuously monitoring benzene detector will enhance the understanding of its impact on human to reduce
or eliminate cancers caused by exposure to benzene."
10910042,"Bacterial infection following spinal fusion surgery is a major clinical concern, with 1-10% of patients
developing infection despite aggressive peri-operative antibiotic treatments. Upwards of 5 million annual spinal
surgeries are predicted by 2030. Current clinical standards involve the use of aseptic drains and packing of ~1g
of powdered vancomycin (VAN) into the wound space; however, this prophylaxis is short-lived (24-48 h). Left
untreated, persistent bacteria form biofilms on the spinal hardware, complicating treatment of the infection by
requiring aggressive systemic antibiotic treatment and removal of the infected hardware, prolonging hospital
admission and patient debilitation. More effective means to prevent infection are a clinical imperative. New
treatment modalities must eradicate pathogens prior to their adherence to the spinal hardware to be effective in
preventing infection. Based on our previous work, our hypothesis is that a time-dependent augmentation of the
initial VAN levels with a combination of antibiotics effective against both Gram-positive AND Gram-negative
bacteria will reduce spinal infection rates. We propose to develop an implantable hydrogel, which will augment
the standard period of aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis through (1) sustained release of VAN at the surgical
site while surgical drains are still present to maintain prophylactic levels of antibiotics, and (2) following surgical
drain removal, external ultrasound-triggered release of a bolus of complementary broad-spectrum antibiotics
(VAN + tobramycin) from within the hydrogel to provide broad spectrum coverage against surviving bacteria.
Use of a combination of antibiotics is expected to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistant pathogens, while also
ensuring that all contaminating pathogens are eradicated from the surgical site. The scientific premise of this
work is that the proposed system will allow rapid, spatiotemporally-controlled, and complete release of antibiotics
at supra-therapeutic levels to reduce bacterial colonization of the surgical hardware. There are three specific
aims: 1) Characterize the release kinetics and stability of the hydrogel as well as the ultrasound-triggered
prophylactic release system using optimized ultrasound parameters, 2) Assess the ability of the ultrasound-
triggered system to prevent bacterial colonization of spinal hardware under in vitro conditions, and 3) Determine
the prophylactic utility of the ultrasound-triggered system in eradicating bacteria and preventing infection in an
in vivo model of spinal surgery. This proposed project addresses the clinical problem of postoperative spinal
infections using innovative applications of proven materials, and can quickly and effectively be translated to the
clinical area upon completion of the project. We anticipate that the project will result in an adjunctive therapy
capable of lowering infection rates in spinal fusion patients, effectively reducing the pain, disability, and mortality
associated with postoperative infection following spinal fusion surgery. Throughout this proposed project, the
applicant will receive training and support in each area as appropriate to perform the research tasks, gaining
invaluable skills and experiences to help advance her career as an independent researcher."

Our long-term goal is to develop structure-based and chemoinformatic methods in ligand discovery, testing
these in experimental model systems and applying them to targets of biological interest. To give the reader a
sense of our direction, we sketch several questions within four broad foci:
A. Development of new docking methods and their testing in model systems like simplified cavity sites, where
individual terms may be disentangled. Several upcoming projects leverage the ultra-large libraries we
introduced in the last period, including: i. are bigger libraries always better, or at some library size do we
saturate? ii. As the library grows, are we still bounded by bio-like molecules, or do we diverge away from
these? How does this affect docking hit quality? iii. Can we treat libraries of tens-of-billions to trillions of
molecules with better methods and look-ahead pattern matching? We are also exploring iv. flexible receptor
docking in the model cavities, and v. treatment of ligand conformational and desolvation strain.
B. Turning the structure-based enterprise on its head, we return to the logic of classical pharmacology with
modern chemoinformatics, seeking to predict targets from their ligands. Leveraging work in the last period, we
i. Investigate if widely consumed molecules, such as neutraceuticals, have specific targets and ii. Use network
pharmacology to find molecules to modulate the human targets subverted by SARS-Cov-2 viral proteins.
C. Application of these methods to biologically interesting targets, often GPCRs. In the upcoming period, we i.
explore bespoke ultra-large libraries for amingergic GPCRs; ii. Extend domain of applicability to transporters;
iii. Seek chemical probes for the yeast mating-factor GPCR Ste2 to complement the power of yeast genetics.
D. The role of colloidal aggregation and phospholipidosis in early drug discovery. Projects in the upcoming
period investigate i. Exploiting colloidal aggregates for drug delivery; ii. Investigating the mechanism of
colloidal aggregation and its impact in early discovery; iii. Investigating a new phenomenon that may have
wide impact on cell-based ligand discovery, phospholipidosis.
This MIRA was previously funded by five grants, and its breadth reflects that. While ambitious, its pragmatism
is supported by the productivity of the last period and by extensive preliminary results."
10910044,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infertility – the inability to conceive a pregnancy within 1-2 years – causes intense psychological distress and
other adverse outcomes for millions of women and men but remains understudied in low- and middle-income
countries. Infertility research is particularly limited in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), despite findings suggesting
SSA has among the highest levels of infertility globally, especially secondary infertility (the inability to conceive
a second or higher-order pregnancy within 1-2 years). Infertility estimates in SSA range widely from 2-31% de-
pending on location, population, definitions, and assessment method; the broad range of estimates highlights
the need for further research to evaluate model assumptions. Besides uncertainty about the extent of infertility,
we lack an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes. Women experiencing the “ag-
ony of infertility” are often blamed, causing physical and emotional abuse, marriage instability, poverty, social
isolation, psychological distress, and even suicide. These impacts may be exacerbated by fears of infertility
and perceived community-level infertility stigma, which have negative impacts on women’s health, health be-
haviors, and care seeking. However, existing research on these phenomena are limited. The objective of this
training grant is to conduct mentored research to address these knowledge gaps by improving the field’s un-
derstanding of infertility levels, stigma, and fears in SSA. This work leverages Performance Monitoring for Ac-
tion (PMA) in Uganda, an ongoing, longitudinal study of reproductive aged (15-49) women. I will work with my
mentors to achieve three specific aims: 1) Improve population-level infertility prevalence estimation by evaluat-
ing infertility measurement model assumptions in Uganda; 2) Understand Ugandan women’s and men’s per-
ceptions, fears, and experiences of infertility and its related stigma, and; 3) Identify dimensions of infertility
stigma and fear among women in Uganda. Results have implications for both population-based measurement
of infertility prevalence and our understanding of infertility stigma and fear, which can inform interventions to
reduce them and their impacts on health and well-being. The corresponding training objectives that will enable
me to complete the proposed research include various training activities and mentorship in: 1) advanced ana-
lytic techniques for the measurement of infertility; 2) qualitative methods; 3) psychometric research techniques;
4) infertility etiologies and relevant conceptual frameworks, and; 5) NIH-grant writing. The proposed research
will lay the groundwork for submitting a competitive R01 application in year 4 proposing a mixed-methods lon-
gitudinal study of infertility, related stigma and fear, and their impacts in SSA. The complementary research
and training will move me toward my long-term goal to become an independent investigator using interdiscipli-
nary, mixed-methods approaches to improve the scientific understanding of health disparities in fertility-related
behaviors (both fertility prevention and promotion) and outcomes in low-resource settings."
10910045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Survival outcomes for patients with lower grade gliomas continue to improve as diagnosis and treatment
evolve. However, damage caused by tumor growth and by the consequences of treatment often leads to
significantly impaired cognitive function. Our previous work has demonstrated that radiation therapy reduced
ratios of N-acetyl-aspartate (a neuronal biomarker) levels to creatine derive from proton-1 MR spectroscopic
imaging within the normal-appearing white matter. This steady state metabolic imaging also provides other
metabolic parameters to differentiate tumor cells from normal brain, detect the presentence of IDH mutation
and predict survival in lower grade glioma. In addition, stable and treatment-free lower grade glioma had
impaired cognition and quality of life, with the severity associated with the history of treatment and the volume
of T2 lesions. These results suggest that the use of multiparametric MRI could improve tumor delineation,
identify patients at risk for specific deficits and provide an opportunity for intervention. The objective of this
translational proposal is to utilize a novel multimodality MR protocol, which integrates dynamic and steady
state MR metabolic imaging with diffusion, perfusion, and resting-state functional MRI to provide quantitative
metrics on dynamic and steady-state metabolism, white matter integrity, blood volume, and functional
networks, to evaluate cognitive functioning and quality of life in patients with lower grade astrocytoma. We will
take advantage of our unique experience in proton-1 MR spectroscopic imaging, which has been implemented
into routine clinical examinations, and hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate imaging, where we performed the
first-in-human [2-13C]pyruvate study to image real-time glycolysis and oxidative metabolism simultaneously, to
assess tumor burden, cognitive functioning, and quality of life. Once the multimodality MR protocol has been
established in Aim 1, we will evaluate the normal and abnormal brain changes during radiation therapy and
then correlate these changes to impairments in cognitive functioning and quality of life in Aim 2. Aim 3 will
examine signatures associated with recurrent tumors and evaluate the impact of tumor burden on cognition
and quality of life. The results of the proposed study will be critical for assessing response to treatment,
developing effective treatment strategies, and improving quality of life. Ultimately, it will provide effective
clinical management of patients and aid neuro-oncologists in making timely decisions."
10910046,"This proposal seeks support for predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows focused on genome and
epigenome integrity in cancer. Two fundamental processes that drive cancer development are genetic mutations
(genome instability) and epigenome reprogramming (epigenome instability). Historically, genome and
epigenome integrity have been studied as separate disciplines. Scientifically, however, the genome and
epigenome integrity are inherently connected by chromatin, an organized complex of DNA, protein and RNA.
Therefore, there is a growing need for future scientists who can bridge these two disciplines to advance cancer
research in a paradigm-shifting way. Recently, Columbia University has emerged as a leading institution for
research and education in genome and epigenome integrity in cancer. Therefore, we propose to create the
nation’s first Genome and Epigenome Integrity in Cancer (GEIC) Training Program to foster next generation
scientists in these two interconnected disciplines of cancer research. To do so, we will leverage the expertise of
our faculty, state-of-the-art resources at Columbia University and exceptional support from the Herbert Irving
Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC). The GEIC Program will be administered by two co-PIs with
complementary scientific expertise in genome and epigenome integrity in cancer. The co-PIs will be advised by
an Executive Committee and an Advisory Board. Program evaluation will be solicited from the Executive
Committee and Advisory Board members, as well as annual anonymous surveys of trainees and mentors. The
HICCC will also provide substantial support to the GEIC program by funding an additional slot for five years. The
GEIC predoctoral trainees will be selected from students enrolled in the Columbia University Graduate School
of Arts & Sciences who have completed the first-year of graduate studies and entered a GEIC laboratory to
pursue their Ph.D. dissertation research in the areas of genome and epigenome integrity in cancer. Postdoctoral
fellows will be selected from two sources, internal and external. Internal trainees will be selected from applicants
already embarking on postdoctoral studies in the laboratories of GEIC Program Faculty. In addition, to increase
the pool of outstanding postdoctoral applicants, as well as the diversity of our trainees, the GEIC Program will
aggressively recruit external postdoctoral applicants. Each trainee is required to develop an individual training
plan approved by the Program directors and Executive Committee and to participate in GEIC program
organized/specified training activities. Progress in these training activities will be evaluated by the Program
Directors, along with the Executive Committee and Advisory Board, before renewal of second year support.
Finally, the Diversity Enhancement Committee will work with Program Directors to actively recruit
underrepresented minority (URM) to the GEIC Program, with the goal of 25% GEIC trainees being URMs. We
expect that the GEIC Training Program will foster next generation of scientists with diverse backgrounds
specialized in genome and epigenome integrity in cancer."
10910252,"1 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease afflicting nearly 2 million people in the U.S. The loss of insulin-
 2 producing β cells in the pancreas results in an absolute requirement for injected insulin, causing significant risks
 3 of mortality and morbidity. T1D is characterized by a latent (asymptomatic) phase, during which autoimmune or
 4 inflammatory pancreatic beta cell injury is postulated to lead to a decline in beta cell function/mass and ultimately
 5 to T1D. A key goal in T1D is halting the autoimmune cellular attack, by limiting immune-mediated damage. The
 6 precise intrapancreatic signaling mechanisms that lead to activation of the immune system and early pancreatic
7 injury remain unclear. Identification of markers closely associated with these key immune events in the
 8 pathogenesis of T1D that can be detected in peripheral circulation would allow for detection of pre-clinical
 9 disease and tracking of disease trajectory. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their contents have emerged as novel
10 mediators of intercellular signaling and functional biomarkers in human metabolic diseases. Data from our
11 collaborative group as part of NIH efforts in EV biology (NIH Common Fund) suggest that circulating cell-specific
12 EVs and their cargo as probes for disease trajectory or cellular health provide greater specificity than traditional
13 circulating RNA or protein biomarkers in whole plasma. Recent studies in T1D suggest that pancreatic beta cells
14 under “stress” produce EVs containing auto-antigens and RNA transcripts that may mediate communication
15 between pancreatic and immune cells by transfer of molecular cargo. Nevertheless, studies characterizing the
16 functional landscape of pancreatic beta-cell-derived EVs in T1D, and their implications as biomarkers of T1D
17 susceptibility in childhood, are lacking. In response to RFA-DK-21-016, we hypothesize that pancreatic islet cell-
18 derived EVs are functional reporters of islet cell biology and contain RNA cargo relevant to regulation of immune
19 responses and beta cell health early in T1D. In Aim 1, we utilize well-established human cellular systems of
20 pancreatic injury (human cell-line and donated human islets, with and without cytokine-mediated injury)
21 alongside methods established by our group to provide proteomic and transcriptional characterization of beta-
22 cell-derived EVs, with isolation of pancreatic beta-cell specific EVs from human circulation in children with and
23 without T1D. In Aim 2, we define the functional role for pancreatic beta-cell specific EVs in innate immune
24 function (macrophages, neutrophils) postulated to serve as early mediators of pancreatic injury via assessments
25 of immunometabolic phenotypes and responses to in vivo administration of human EVs to a diabetes-prone
26 model system. In Aim 3, we will use RNA-seq and bioinformatics to identify pancreatic beta cell-specific
27 transcripts associated with incident T1D from children from the long-standing NIDDK TEDDY study (n=140, 1:1
28 T1D case/control) at high immunologic risk for T1D. Upon completion, this application will provide a broad
29 phenotypic, functional and clinical characterization of human beta cell derived EVs toward developing a signature
30 of pancreatic cell-specific EVs relevant to early T1D development, addressing the aims of RFA-DK-21-016."

award used a longitudinal cohort study as its platform and advanced our knowledge of: 1) clinical assessment
tools targeting mobility and falls; 2) important modifiable risk factors for mobility decline; and 3) characterized
important conditions that influence these outcomes. I successfully mentored 18 trainees, from diverse
backgrounds, leading to over 45 original publications. In addition to the pre-existing longitudinal cohort study,
which was recently publicly archived, a new VA funded randomized controlled trial focusing on
Prehabilitative care will serve as the primary platform for this renewal. Trainees will be exposed to
principles and concepts of geriatric rehabilitation, Prehabilitative care, POR and the conduct of clinical trials.
 Over the previous 20 years, I have led a successful research career in the Department of PM&R at
Harvard Medical School (HMS). In 2015, I became the Director of New England Geriatric Research Education
and Clinical Center (NEGRECC), the first Physiatrist to ever lead a VA GRECC. The transition to my VA
leadership role took time and diverted my effort. I am now ready to resume my role as a K24 mentor. I am an
Associate Professor, and my appointment to Professor is advancing through the promotions process. My
current administrative, research, educational and clinical responsibilities within VA only allows 10% effort/week
for mentoring of research trainees. I have a joint appointment between the VA and HMS. Under this award, my
non-VA responsibilities will be relieved such that I will be enabled to direct an additional 30% effort/week
towards the mentoring of research trainees in POR bringing my total effort to devote to mentoring to 40%.
 Projects that support this award include a VA merit award (RX003095-01A1) as well as the recently
archived longitudinal cohort study (1R01AG032052). Also, the work will be supported by the NIH funded Boston
Pepper Center, the Boston Roybal Center and the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science as well as the
NEGRECC. With the themes of Geriatric Rehabilitation and Prehabilitation, we will provide: direct mentoring with
the PI, training in rehabilitation science and aging research, training in the responsible conduct of research,
training in research project management, data analysis, biostatistical consultation, and an K24 advisory board
consisting of experienced scientists in relevant fields of interest. Redundancies are built in to the offerings to
provide varying options that successfully serve the individual needs of all trainees. This grant will have a
significant impact on geriatric rehabilitative care by supporting our laboratory as a vital pipeline for POR."

Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are mainstream delivery platforms in gene therapy because of its safety profile and promising results in clinical trials. AAV has been successfully used to deliver transgenes to liver, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and eye. Yet AAV-mediated gene transfer to adipose tissue is left far behind due to the low transduction efficiency and tropism of natural AAV serotypes. Our previous study demonstrates that an engineered hybrid capsid Rec2, transduces adipose tissue with superior efficiency than natural AAV serotypes. One caveat is that Rec2 capsid vector also transduces liver efficiently upon systemic administration. To mitigate off-target transgene expression in the liver, we have developed a novel dual-cassette vector design to severely restrict transgene expression in the liver. Although the dual-cassette design coupled with Rec2 capsid significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of AAV-mediated gene delivery to adipose tissue, there are drawbacks such as the presence of Rec2 vectors in the liver and therefore bearing the risk of viral vector-associated toxicity; inability to suppress transgene expression in the liver if miRNA and shRNA are the transgene; the dual-cassette further reducing the cargo size. The weaknesses of existing technology highlight the need to generate new capsids with enhanced adipose tropism while eliminating liver tropism. Recently, we made several mutations in the Rec2 capsid to alter the tropism. Eight capsid variants (named LC.V1~8) have been generated, packaged, and tested in vivo. The capsid variant LC.V7, with three point-mutations, was found to possess exclusive adipo-tropism as it achieved substantial transduction in adipose tissue while completely eliminating liver transduction. Moreover, LC.V7 capsid vector did not transduce heart, spleen, muscle, kidney, or pancreas. Dosing experiment found that 4 x 1010 viral genome (vg) per mouse via intraperitoneal injection was sufficient for LC.V7 to transduce visceral fat and no transgene expression was detected in liver or any other peripheral tissues. Of note, 4 x 1010 vg/mouse is a low dose relative to systemic use of natural AAV serotypes often in the range of 1011 to 1012. In this project, we propose to develop the next generation of AAV vector platform for adipose gene delivery based on the novel LC.V7 capsid. In Aim 1, we will comprehensively characterize LC.V7 vector including biodistribution, administration routes, liver toxicity, and durability of transgene expression in lean and obese states. We will improve AAV genomic design to enhance transgene expression in adipose tissue. In Aim 2, we will develop LC.V7-based gene therapies for lipodystrophy. We will clone human leptin and human adiponectin cDNA sequence to the optimized AAV expression plasmid using a 2A sequence to express these two adipokines from one transcript and test the efficacy and safety of this gene therapy in two lipodystrophy models. This novel adipo-tropic AAV vector platform could provide a powerful tool for basic research and therapeutic purposes."

The 22q11.2 Deletion (22qDel) is the most common microdeletion syndrome and confers a high risk for
developing schizophrenia. Though the etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear, accumulating evidence
supports the hypothesis that mitochondria are adversely impacted. Mitochondria are known to provide
extensive support for the highly specialized and localized functions of neurons. Interestingly, several 22q11.2
locus gene products localize to mitochondria and are decreased in 22qDel. SLC25A1 and MRPL40, two of the
22q11.2 mitochondrial genes, have recently been found to interact biochemically and genetically. Therefore,
22qDel may impact neuronal development by compromising mitochondrial function. Our lab has generated
isogenic 22q11.2 induced pluripotent stem cells from neurotypical controls and differentiated these lines to
various 2D and 3D neuronal models. The overall objective of this project is to determine how mitochondria
are impacted in 22qDel in developing neural tissue and to assess potential key putative driver genes. My
central hypothesis is that the loss of 22q11.2 mitochondrial protein disrupts mitochondrial development and
functionality and certain mitochondrial proteins, such as SLC25A1 and MRPL40, interacts to drive the
assembly and integrity of mitochondrial ribosomal machinery and translation and are dysregulated in 22qDel.
Aim 1 will quantify global mitochondrial function in live cell respiration assays and determine the protein
expression of various OXPHOS subunits in developing neural cells and tissues. I will then quantify the
differences in mitochondrial quantity, morphology, and membrane potential in subcellular neuronal
compartments. Aim 2 will determine the impact of reduced expression of both SLC25A1 and MRPL40 on
mitoribosomal integrity and expression and local/mitochondrial protein synthesis using short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) in iPSC-derived neurons. These aims will inform our understanding of the impact of 22q11.2 deletion
on mitochondria and neuronal development, which may provide novel insights into the shared biology of
schizophrenia."
10906804,"Chronic ocular pain is a highly distressing symptom as its occurrence results in high morbidity without effective
treatment. Patients with dry eye (DE) commonly have painful ocular symptoms, yet the neural mechanisms
underlying this type of pain may include inflammatory (as in Sjogren's syndrome) and/or neuropathic
contributors (as in neuropathic ocular pain [NOP]). The cornea is innervated by the trigeminal nerve, which
conveys peripheral input to the central nervous system. Using neuroimaging to evaluate peripheral nerves to
supraspinal structures, we propose to define the structural and functional differences in the trigeminal circuit
that differentiate inflammatory and neuropathic pain. In aim 1, we will determine trigeminal nerve pathology in
persons with Sjogren's vs. NOP vs. controls using quantitative sensory testing (QST), in vivo corneal nerve
microscopy (IVCM), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In aim 2, we will define differences between Sjogren's
vs. NOP in the central nervous system by comparing functional responses to light-induced pathways
associated with photophobia using fMRI, and structure using MRI and DTI. This study is likely to yield (1)
structural and functional diagnostic markers to differentiate inflammatory and neuropathic ocular pain with
neuroimaging, and (2) evince a neurological source of pain symptoms with neuropathic ocular pain. Data
generated from this investigation may be used to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of patients suffering
from chronic ocular pain, and provide an objective marker to base clinical decision making."

Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT) can provide a cure for chronic infections, genetic
diseases, or cancers of the blood. However, its therapeutic utility is limited by associated toxicities
resulting from graft versus host disease (GVHD). Among the most prominent morbidities of GVHD is
damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Recent results from our groups have revealed that the severity of
GVHD is impacted by the nature and metabolic properties of the gut microbiome. Further, we found that
promotion of microbial communities that facilitate the metabolism of starch into butyrate and reprogram
bile acid metabolism of the host ameliorate or even prevent GVDH following BMT. The measure and
quantitation of metabolism is essential to address the associated experimental aims across the
research proposals. The purpose of the Metabolomics core is to support the research projects that
build on these studies to detect and quantify metabolites from these pathways in stool from mice, bacterial
populations, human epithelial cells, and longitudinal stool samples of patients in the associated clinical
trial. Further, this core will also provide global insights into host and microbiome metabolism using stable
isotope tracing technologies and untargeted metabolome-wide profiling. By centralizing the development,
maintenance, and implementation of metabolomics methods, this core will provide state-of-the-art
capabilities to facilitate data collection and analysis while ensuring consistency across projects."
10932422,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 4
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potent form of cellular therapy that
has the potential to cure malignant and benign hematological conditions. However, its utility is limited
by the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GI GVHD is the principal cause of non-
relapse mortality (NRM) after allo-HCT. Recent evidence has brought into focus the role played by the
metabolites derived from host-microbiota interactions in the severity of GI GVHD. However, the
biological mechanisms, clinical feasibility, and the impact of altering the GI microbial metabolites on GI
GVHD remain unknown. Project 4 will focus on dietary manipulation of the microbiome-metabolomic
axis via dietary supplementation with resistant potato starch (RPS) for mitigating GVHD in allo-HCT
patients. This project encompasses an investigator initiated proof-of-concept clinical trial that has been
developed to translate the preliminary data generated from Projects 1 and 3. This trial is being
performed under an IND from the FDA. It includes serial biosample (stool and plasma) collection and
analyses for the microbiota and metabolite alterations, informed by mechanistic studies from projects 1,
2, and 3. We will also combine these data with longitudinal measurement of molecules reflecting
intestinal epithelial injury, collectively comprising discovery approaches to more comprehensively study
the effects of RPS on the microbiome, its dependent metabolites and host in allo-HCT patients."
10918512,"Abstract.
Hematologic malignancies are often treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT). However, HSCT is complicated by graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), a
severe, potentially lethal complication initiated when donor alloreactive T cells attack host cells
and organs. Despite the administration of prophylactic regimens for aGVHD as standard pre-
transplantation therapy, up to 60% of these patients develop aGVHD of grade II or higher, and
require additional immunosuppressive intervention. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve
pre-transplantation therapies to prevent aGVHD. We identified a probiotic exopolysaccharide
(EPS) that induces tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) that inhibit T cell proliferation, and we
found that EPS-treated human DCs (EPS-DCs) both inhibited T cell proliferation in mixed
lymphocyte reactions, and significantly increased survival of humanized NSG-HLA-A2 mice
after transplantation with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC). The data
indicate that a cell-based therapy using EPS-DCs can mitigate aGvHD, and the goal of this Phase
I R41 grant is to determine the in vivo fate of EPS-DCs and optimize protection from GvHD by
these EPS-DCs; optimize treatment to maximize the graft vs leukemia response; and establish
DC and T cell biomarkers of EPS-mediated suppression of GvHD. These studies will provide a
novel cell-based therapy for preventing GvHD in patients receiving HSCT. This cell therapy will
be translatable to humans because large numbers of EPS-DCs can be generated and frozen in
bulk and used as “off the shelf” treatment, for all patients, independent of MHC types."
10929288,"Glaucoma is a serious and growing health problem for our nation's Veterans. At least 285,000 Veterans
(possibly over 700,000) have this chronic disease, the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally.
Prevalence is greater among Veterans than in the general population and is increasing dramatically. Women
Veterans and blast injury survivors are at higher risk for developing glaucoma as they age. Glaucoma is a
serious problem for our nation's Veterans; we intend to do something about this.
 The greatest risk factors associated with glaucoma are elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and age.
Elevated IOP damages retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causing blindness. Initially many patients respond well to
topically-applied IOP-lowering drugs, but disease often returns over time. Given the aging Veteran population,
there is thus an urgent need to develop new treatment strategies for late-stage disease. We propose a new,
IOP-independent approach that directly protects RGCs by treating with a synthetic analog to Brain-Derived
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) that we developed to protect RGCs from ocular blast injury, N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-
indol-3-yl)ethyl]-2-oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC). We hypothesize that treatment with HIOC will slow
or stop vision loss and protect RGCs in mouse models of glaucoma, including in aged mice. We
propose two aims to test this hypothesis:
Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of using a TrkB activator as a treatment for glaucoma, we will test
whether HIOC treatment protects RGCs and vision in a mouse model of induced ocular hypertension.
Hypothesis: TrkB activation by HIOC treatment will protect against RGC loss in a mouse model of induced,
elevated IOP. IOP elevation will be induced by injecting microbeads into the ocular anterior segment to impede
aqueous humor outflow. The resulting loss of RGCs and visual function mimics disease etiology observed in
human glaucoma patients. HIOC will be given systemically by intraperitoneal injection at various times relative
to induction and at various doses. Visual function, morphological, and toxicological outcomes will be assessed
over time. To confirm that chronic, repeated HIOC treatment activates TrkB over time, the phosphorylation of
TrkB and downstream mediators will be examined. Also, HIOC will be co-administered with a TrkB receptor
antagonist to confirm protection specifically in a glaucoma model occurs through TrkB activation.
Aim 2. To gain additional translational insight, test whether HIOC treatment is protective in a naturally-
occurring glaucoma mouse model, the DBA/2J mouse. Hypothesis: TrkB activation induced by HIOC
treatment will be protective in a naturally-occurring glaucoma model whose etiology includes late-onset,
gradual elevation of IOP, RGC loss, and vision loss, as seen in human disease. The DBA/2J mouse develops
pigment dispersion syndrome. Like many human glaucomas, the DBA/2J model is sporadic and progressive.
This makes it a cumbersome model for testing multiple experimental permutations (as proposed in Aim 1), but
a logical and powerful test for HIOC efficacy. To increase translational relevance, treatment will start after IOP
elevation but prior RGC loss.
These studies will test whether a BDNF TrkB receptor activator protects RGCs and vision in complementary
mouse models of glaucoma. Similar to how we developed and brought another drug to trial (NCT02841306),
this project contains proof-of-principle, mechanistic, and translationally-oriented experiments that will add to
preclinical data in support of our proposing ophthalmic clinical trials of HIOC, a potentially inexpensive
treatment for Veterans suffering from a currently intractable, chronic disease that results in blindness."

decrease in user activity after an initial period of heavy use (as in SA2) and behavioral changes that could signal onset of
cognitive change. Effective management of these by AI or machine learning models (MLs) will be a key
commercialization metric to engage upstream business partners (payors) and position the platform to address ADRD

Phase II. Games will be accessed by approaches proven to enhance engagement, e.g., cumulating points for using visual
maps to complete ADLs and that reflect independent functioning (e.g., attending meals with others). New AI/ML models
will gamify the experience and upgrade our serious games with reward systems. We will tailor ML models from SA1 with
an emphasis on applicability to sociodemographically diverse communities, including data from social determinants of
health in SA3. These will be packaged into programs that can be upsold to B2B clients. We will consult with experts at

10921394,"Abstract -
PFAS are a ubiquitous and diverse class of toxic, persistent, synthetic fluorochemicals that easily travel in the
environment and have been detected in water resources and water systems globally, earning the moniker
“forever chemicals”. Widespread PFAS contamination has resulted from the production and use of fluorinated
chemicals in consumer and industrial products for many decades, spanning uses including non-stick coated
cookware, firefighting foams, cosmetics, electronic components manufacturing, and many others. While the far-
reaching impacts of PFAS exposure are still under investigation, noted adverse health effects include cancer,
thyroid disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and preeclampsia, among others. The annual cost burden of
these health effects has been estimated at $62.6B for the U.S. and €52-84B ($37-59B) in Europe, though even
these figures are noted as likely underestimates. Despite the severity of this problem, no process in standard
wastewater treatment facilities adequately addresses PFAS contamination, enabling the release of PFAS-
containing discharge into surface waters that are used as drinking water sources. Activated carbon (AC) and ion
exchange (IX) resins suffer from low capacity and/or selectivity, especially against short-chain PFAS; reverse
osmosis (RO) suffers from high energy demands and costs despite only a moderate (5-10x) PFAS concentration
factor. Furthermore, today’s PFAS removal sorbents are poorly regenerable, often destined for incineration or
landfill disposal once their PFAS removal capacity is exhausted; sorbents compatible with thermal reactivation
(AC) have relatively low capacity and/or incur high costs and energy-intensive processes. Addressing these
gaps, Sorbenta has developed a patent-protected class of granular sorbents that selectively remove PFAS from
complex waters. By leveraging synergistic ionic and fluorous interactions in a single resin, the technology
specifically targets PFAS removal over background contaminants. In this Phase I project, Sorbenta seeks to
accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Enhancing IF sorbent regenerability while minimizing volume of PFAS-
laden waste; 2) Investigating compatibility to treat a range of commercially relevant, PFAS-laden influents; and
3) Developing a suspension process for manufacturing sorbent beads. Successful accomplishment of these aims
will advance the technology toward a marketable solution for PFAS removal and set the team up for success in
Phase II, during which the technology will be scaled up and further tested for selective removal of a broad
selection of PFAS compounds. Completion of this project will allow Sorbenta to deliver an easily implementable
treatment solution that can be appropriately scaled for use across applications including industrial treatment, site
remediation, municipal drinking water treatment, all the way down to at-home point-of-entry and point-of-use
installations."
10935992,"Multiple human psychiatric disorders are associated with unusual social behaviors related
to aggression, anxiety, and affiliation. Although the genetic component of these disorders is well
established, their inheritance is complex and identification of the causative genes is often
extremely difficult. The growth of phenotypic and genetic information, however, revealed that
unusual behaviors observed in these disorders often represent the extreme ends of behavioral
variation observed in the general population, suggesting that genes implicated in social behavior
in unaffected population also influence disorder risk and symptom severity. To identify the genes
and pathways disturbed in psychiatric disorders, an understanding of the molecular basis of
mammalian social behavior would provide a crucial step forward.
 The goals of this project are to resolve differences in affiliation, aggression, and anxiety-

11179081,"The goal of this program is to establish an integrated multi-disciplinary team of highly collaborative investigators that will plan and conduct iterative, in-depth immunologic analyses of tissue-specific and systemic responses in small animals, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans to identify the key immune responses needed for protection against Mtb; identify immunologic targets that can be used to improve TB vaccine strategies. Other research activities under the program may include determining the impact of HIV/SIV and Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infection(s) on relevant immune responses to Mtb infection or TB vaccines and identifying how bacterial immune evasion mechanisms subvert immune responses to Mtb."
10922377,"Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requires a combination of many highly toxic drugs and
radiation therapy, yet the 5-year survival rate remains about 18%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting
PD-L1/PD-1 has caused a paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment, but the response rate is still only 15-20%.
PDX Pharmaceuticals in partnership with Oregon Health and Science University is developing a next
generation immunotherapy called ARAC-02 that may lead to curative outcomes in a large number of NSCLC
patients. ARAC-02 (Antigen Release Agent and Checkpoint Inhibitor) is built upon our core patented
nanoparticle platform (Pdx-NPTM) capable of co-delivering multiple therapeutic agents, while keeping a small
size in saline, suitable for systemic administration and tumor accumulation. ARAC-02 co-delivers a polo-like
kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA to kill cancer and release antigens as well as modulate immunosuppression in the
tumor microenvironment, a PD-L1 antibody to home to cancer cells and serve as immune checkpoint blockade,
and immune-stimulant CpG to enhance antigen presentation, leading to strong anti-tumor immune response.
The parent fast-track SBIR application was deemed highly impactful and novel that it received a rare perfect
score from the NIH scientific review panel. The data was published in Nature Communications and a US patent
of ARAC-02 compositions and uses was issued in 2022. We have met the Phase I milestones (formulation
optimization) and progressed to Phase II project (efficacy and safety evaluation in multiple animal models).
To increase commercialization readiness of ARAC-02, we request the CRP fund to support two activities.
Aim 1: To protect intellectual properties (IPs) of the ARAC pipeline. PDX Pharma has been developing
next-generation nanoparticle delivery platform (Pdx-NP) and first-in-class combination immunotherapies
utilizing our expertise in nanotechnology along with cancer systems biology to select synergistic drug
combinations that maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Our effort and strong data have led to five US
patents issued in the past 2 years. Specific to ARAC-02, we request CRP funds to (1) pursue IP protection of
Pdx-NPTM and ARAC-02 abroad (in 10 countries and the EU) and (2) expand the IP coverage to other
therapeutic classes beyond PLK1 inhibitors through continuation patent applications.
Aim 2: To initiate GMP-compliant manufacturing of ARAC-02. A key ARAC-02’s component is PD-L1
antibody conjugated nanoparticle (A-NP), which will be mixed with PLK1 siRNA and CpG in the clinic. The core
nanoparticle (NP) has already been manufactured at large-scale by the CRO. In this Aim, we will perform tech-
transfer the synthesis and characterization of A-NP to the same CRO for process familiarization. This aim will
be followed by a full GMP-compliant synthesis campaign, which will be funded through private investment.
Strong IP portfolio and GMP readiness will enhance our success rate in the upcoming private fund raising and
the follow-on Phase IIB SBIR application toward complete IND-enabling studies and clinical trials of ARAC-02."

Major peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is classified as an injury with a long defect (≥3cm) or occurring proximally,
requiring long regenerative distances of the host nerve to distal structures (distal nerve, target muscle, etc.).
These features result in minimal, if any, functional regeneration as the distal nerve and muscle often degenerate
before the host nerve is able to reinnervate these structures due to inherently slow regeneration rates. Since
current standard clinical practices delay repairing nerve injuries until the patient (in cases of polytrauma) or the
injury site is stabilized, functional recovery is often extremely limited. In order to maintain the innervation
capability of nerves and muscles following injury, the team at Axonova Medical has developed a proxy for these
degenerating axons to maintain or “babysit” the distal structures until the host axons are able to reinnervate the
distal targets. This product, the micro-tissue engineered nerve graft (µTENG), which acts as a tissue engineered
neuromuscular interface, consists of axon tracts spanning a discrete population of neurons within a hydrogel
column. Notably, the diameter of µTENGs is designed to be on the scale of micrometers, making them injectable
to facilitate incorporation into current standard of care practices in the clinic. In pre-clinical rodent studies,
µTENGs have been seen to extend axons into distal structures post implantation, resulting in babysitting of distal
nerve, therefore keeping the muscle receptive to eventual host axon reinnervation.
Previously, larger laboratory-grade µTENGs have been fabricated using primary rat and porcine neurons within
an agarose microcolumn. Through the Phase I studies, a clinically relevant product was developed and
characterized using GalSafe® neurons within a chitosan microcolumn, with a 200-200µm diameter. Through the
successful completion of this proposal, we will advance µTENGs to the clinic by establishing current good
manufacturing practices (cGMP)-like manufacturing, critical quality attributes, release criteria, and an effective
dosing paradigm. We will also complete in vivo studies in a porcine model of PNI to determine the efficacy of
µTENGs to promote functional recovery following delayed repair. Successful execution of these studies will
accelerate preclinical safety and efficacy studies and will be incorporated in Axonova’s IND application. Overall,
µTENGs hold promise in transforming the field of nerve repair by significantly increasing the clinical window for
PNI repair."

There is an enormous need for therapeutics to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Adult Hippocampal
Neurogenesis (AHN) is critical for normal learning and memory, but it declines in patients with AD. Work in
animal models has underscored the role of AHN in improving cognition in the face of AD pathology.
Augmenting AHN represents a promising potential avenue to promote cognitive function in the setting of mild
cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in other neurological conditions. In this Phase I effort,
we will evaluate lead candidate exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in human neural cell culture.
Our ASOs have already demonstrated successful target modulation in two human cell types and in vivo
efficacy studies are ongoing. These proposed studies represent an important advancement in our development
efforts as they will generate data on our ability to modulate our target in cells that are physiologically highly
similar to our ultimate target cell of interest, and may lead to biomarker identification. We will use these ASOs
in validated patient cell lines in two “AD environments” to study their ability to achieve successful exon
skipping, alter protein expression, and modulate signaling and function. Exon-skipping ASOs have emerged as
effective and safe agents for regulating alternative splicing in the CNS, and significant advancements are
ongoing with respect to non-invasive and minimally invasive routes of administration that would permit broad
clinical implementation. Determining in vitro efficacy of our candidate ASOs is a critical step towards
developing a highly targeted, safe and effective therapeutic for promoting AHN and improving cognition in AD.
If successful, these studies would provide significant biological validation of the therapeutic potential of our
candidate ASOs for the treatment or prevention of AD and other neurological conditions, and will enable us to
build additional support as we works towards an Investigational New Drug Application with FDA."
